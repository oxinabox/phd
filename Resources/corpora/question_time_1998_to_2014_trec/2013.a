  I addressed this question about surplus and the government's budget position, indeed the nation's budget position, when I spoke at the National Press Club last Wednesday. The circumstance in which we find ourselves really has not been experienced for a long time in Australia's national life - that is, the amount of government revenue being generated per unit of GDP is at its lowest since the early 1990s and is far lower than was expected by Treasury. The difference before the days of the GFC is stark, but even since then the GFC revenue returns have been far lower than anticipated by Treasury. There are a number of factors, some of them domestic, some of the global, which are leading to this result, and it is important for anybody who seeks to be taken seriously in the economic debate to understand the factors that are pressing on the Australian revenue.                 We continue to see weakness in the global economy and we continue to see remarkable strength in our currency - in the dollar. That remarkable strength in our currency is persisting, even though we have seen a reduction in our terms of trade and even though we have seen a reduction in interest rates. Orthodox economic models would tell you that a reduction in the terms of trade and a reduction in interest rates would likely see our currency lose some value; but it has persisted at a very high level. What that means is that for those industries that are competing, that are export oriented - whether it be manufacturing, whether it be tourism, whether it be services sectors like international education - there is a lot of pressure from the Australian dollar and that pressure is translating into pressure on profitability.                  We are also at a phase of the resources boom where we are seeing widespread and large investment. We have not hit the peak of the investment yet. But it is not at this stage that we see the maximum return from resources; that obviously happens when you move from the peak investment phase to the peak production phase. So there is a set of factors - some them cyclical, some of them not anticipated - which are pressing on the amount of revenue being received by government. This is a challenge for everyone in our nation's life and one that requires careful work and thinking through. It certainly means that we will be adhering to our medium-term fiscal strategy as the Treasurer has outlined it. That requires the offsetting of expenditure by saving in the forward estimates period, and I would recommend the same strategy to the Leader of the Opposition when and if he produces any costings.

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question, and I thank her and all government members for their focused interest in our nation's future. We share in common great Labor values. What those values mean is that we always focus on creating opportunity and fairly sharing opportunity and that we always focus on protecting people from the risks they can encounter during the course of a lifetime. For this Labor government, that means the work of 2013 is focused on creating opportunities, sharing opportunities and protecting people from risk.                  We enter this year with real and clear plans to make sure that we keep our focus on jobs and growth - jobs in our economy overall, economic management to ensure jobs are created - and on industries, like manufacturing, that are bearing the brunt of the high Australian dollar. We are proud of the fact that, even during the worst of global economic times, by keeping a focus on jobs and growth we have created more than 800,000 jobs while around the world far more than 20 million jobs have been shed.                  To ensure that in the future we can also offer Australians the benefit of jobs and growth, we need in this world to be continuously modernising our economy. That is why we are delivering the very detailed policies and plans that will seize us a clean energy future, that will improve our infrastructure - including the rolling out of the National Broadband Network - that will improve the opportunity of Australians for new skills so that they can get the jobs of the future and that will ensure the nation is appropriately regulated and people are not caught up in red tape. That will mean we will tap into growth: the growth in our region of the world in this time of change as Asia rises.                  At the same time we are also focused on protecting people from the risks they run in an ordinary life, including the risk that someone in their family or, indeed, an individual will confront a profound disability during the course of their life. What is important is that government works with them to ensure they get fair help and a fair deal. That is why I am very proud that, on 1 July this year, we will launch the National Disability Insurance Scheme.                  This is the work of 2013 and this is the work for this government beyond 2013 - making sure that there are real plans to give people opportunity and real plans to support modern families as they encounter the risks of life, including the risk of disability.

  First, to the Leader of the Opposition: I know that he is engaged in a pretence about having a plan for the nation. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that a plan is when you outline in detail what you are going to do, how you are going to do it, what it is going to cost and how you are going to pay for it. The unfortunate truth for the Leader of the Opposition is that not once since the election in 2010 has he produced a policy with a proper costing and not once since the election of 2010 has he produced a policy with credible savings - and that applies to all areas, including superannuation.                      What I can say to the Leader of the Opposition very clearly is this: No. 1, as the political party that brought superannuation to working Australians, we will always do the right thing by the futures of working Australians and their superannuation, which is why we are increasing superannuation contributions from nine to 12 per cent. This is the superannuation scheme that the Leader of the Opposition variously described as a 'con' as he opposed Australian working people having superannuation. So the political party that created it -                      As the political party that created superannuation, we will always be the political party that does the right thing by working Australians and their retirement income - decent, hardworking Australians: the modern families who we seek to serve. In stark contrast, the Leader of the Opposition has said to families around the nation - to working people around the nation - that he will rip off their superannuation. In particular, he has said that he is determined to rip away the low-income superannuation boost that we are giving them. That means 3.6 million workers earning under $37,000 face the Leader of the Opposition's rip-off - that is, three in 10 workers in this nation are on his hit list, people who he wants to see poorer when they retire -                      I can certainly say to the Leader of the Opposition: we, who are determined to benefit people like the 3.6 million low-income earners who would be predominantly women, will make sure we provide those benefits and we will fight the Leader of the Opposition's plan to rip them off.

  I thank the member for Banks for that question. Before I directly answer that question, I would like to report to the House that the Reserve Bank has now decided to keep the cash rate steady at three per cent. This means that a home owner, say, with an average mortgage of around $300,000, remains around $5,000 better off per year compared to when this government came to office. The RBA has cut rates repeatedly over the last 15 months partly in response to global volatility but also because the government has been running a very strong fiscal policy that has kept inflation contained and given the Reserve Bank of Australia flexibility and room to cut rates. I was asked by the member for Banks about why we must put in place reforms to strengthen our economy - to strengthen our economy for our children and our grandchildren, because reform can be pretty tough; it can be hard yards.                      This government is very clearly focused on reforms which will strengthen our economy and our country for the future. We are proud of the fact that we have faced up to the big reforms over the past five years - big reforms like the NBN to lift productivity and to support business; big reforms like carbon pricing to make sure that a First World economy is driven by clean energy. It is this same determination to look to the future that this government is putting in place in 2013 for the next five years, in particular our determination to support jobs and growth. It is the top priority of this government, and it has been since day 1. It is why we moved to support our economy during the global financial crisis. It is one of the reasons that our economy is now 13 per cent bigger than it was back in 2007. Our priority has been jobs and growth and the peace of mind of the Australian community.                  At the end of last year we took a very big whack to revenues - $4 billion, a revenue write-down over four months that we had previously written down for the whole year. That is why we said then that our first priority does remain with supporting jobs and growth, and that is what we will continue to do. When we support growth and when we have a strong economy, we have a strong budget and we have the capacity to put in place the very big reforms for the future which will lift productivity - particularly the school improvement program, the Gonski program and, of course, making a fairer Australia through the National Disability Insurance Scheme. There can be no doubt about our determination to strengthen our economy and our country for the future.

  Of course when any worker loses their job around the country that is a very disturbing matter for them and their family. It puts a lot of pressure on. From the point of view of this government, all you will ever see us do is support working people who find themselves in that position. Indeed, we know how shattering it can be for someone to confront the circumstance of unemployment, and that is why we took the actions we did in the global financial crisis to keep Australians working and to keep them in jobs.                 On the question of Penrice and the production of soda ash that the member asked about, I think it is important that we are accurate about what was putting pressure on this company, accurate about the impacts and also accurate about carbon pricing. So let us go through the facts, which I believe the members opposite ought to be interested in. The facts are these. Soda ash sells for around $340 per tonne. That is a fact. After assistance, the impact of the carbon price on a tonne of soda ash is around $1.20 a tonne. That is the fact. The impact of carbon pricing on soda ash production is similar to a 0.3c appreciation in the Australian dollar. As we all know, we have seen a 60 per cent appreciation in our currency over the last few years. So the pressures on this business are strongly impacted by the strength of the Australian dollar. It is also impacted by factors like lower international shipping costs, which are making imports more competitive.                     Thank you very much, Speaker. That was a clear example of the continued negativity of the opposition. I was bringing to the parliament the facts, and I think the facts matter, and no amount of headshaking by the member for Indi changes that. So, when we are talking about this business, there were clear pressures. I have given you the figures about the impact of carbon pricing compared with the impact of the Australian dollar. Obviously the impact of carbon pricing is very, very, very, very modest indeed. So this is an example of the kind of change we are seeing across our manufacturing sector, driven overwhelmingly by the high Australian dollar. That is why we will respond to those real pressures with a statement on jobs and innovation and why we will always resist the opposition's plans to cut back assistance to manufacturing.                  Leave granted.

  I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I understand his concern about this matter, because I am very concerned about it too. In the first discussion I had with Premier Newman about the circumstances in Queensland, this was a matter that we discussed. There was the loss of telecommunications, and there was a considerable geographic area of Queensland where people were therefore unable to make triple-0 calls, and of course that is a very concerning thing. Telstra worked to restore communications capability, and as that work was underway I kept my eye on that because I understood how important it was that this telecommunications capacity got back up and running as soon as possible. So we saw this outage as a result of flood damage in Queensland, and I can understand the member for Kennedy's concerns that we do not want to see that kind of loss of telecommunications again.                 I think we have to be fairly practical about what we can do and what we cannot do. The reality is that there will always be some circumstances of nature that are so ferocious that, even with the best of preparations, things that people identify as necessary services, services that we are all used to living with, will be lost. Indeed, the Leader of the Nationals referred to the loss of things like power and gas. Those things do happen in circumstances of natural disaster. But we should be doing everything we can to make the networks that bring these services to people as resilient as possible.                 I have certainly asked for further information on this issue in Queensland, how it happened and what we can learn from it.                 I talked about it publicly in Queensland. I was asked about it on radio and said, 'Of course, it is incumbent upon us to learn everything we can from this natural disaster to have better resilience next time.' We have learnt from natural disasters in the past. For example, we learnt from the bushfires in Victoria. That is what led to us having the capability, during these natural disasters, to put warnings on people's phones. They were very valuable for people.                 I can assure the member for Kennedy that, in the design of the NBN, NBN Co. are placing the highest priority on reliability and strength of the network in the design and planning stages. They have taken into account natural disaster occurrences, like flooding, in the basic network design. But if there is something we can learn for the future from what happened in Queensland this summer then I am certainly very determined to learn it and make sure that we respond to that lesson.

  I thank the member for Deakin very much for that question. As he knows, there are many families in Deakin who have been getting their kids ready for school both last week and this week and making sure that they have all the things their children need: the school shoes, school books and all of those essentials. Parents have been out in many, many stores around the country buying those goods.                 The first instalment of this government's schoolkids bonus was paid to families right around the country just a few weeks ago. This, of course, was paid as part of our plan to help Australian families. This year we will see 1.3 million Australian families, covering 2.2 million children, benefit from this government's schoolkids bonus. That means $410 per primary school aged child and $820 per secondary school aged child. That is what this government is delivering - that extra money to make sure that parents have money in the bank. That is where it has gone, straight into the bank accounts of these families to make sure parents have the money when they need it to help them get their kids ready for school.                 Of course, we are hearing all the catcalling from those opposite. We know that, unlike this government, they have a plan to rip this money off families, to take all of this money off 1.3 million Australian families, to fill their budget black hole. That is what this Leader of the Opposition is planning to do - take all of this money straight off families. For a typical Australian family, this Leader of the Opposition would see them lose $15,000 over the school life of their children. This Leader of the Opposition would be responsible for ripping all of that money out of the pockets of families just because he has a very serious budget black hole. Families know which side of this parliament is on their side, and it is this Labor government.

  Thank you very much, Speaker. I thank the member for North Sydney for his question. I can see that the summertime fitness regime has involved weight lifting as well. Congratulations to him - well done!                 I refer the member for North Sydney to my earlier answer in the House, I refer him to my statements at the National Press Club and I ask him, in what should be a year where there is the time and the space and the certainty for a sophisticated policy debate, to try and deal with the level of sophistication necessary in the economic debate before this nation.                 We find ourselves in a circumstance where, per unit of GDP, less revenue is being returned to the government than at any time since the 1990s. Indeed, around the world, other democracies, other developed countries, are also struggling with this phenomenon. There are no doubt cyclical factors at play and, as I indicated in my National Press Club speech, and as the Assistant Treasurer has said on more than one occasion, there may be some things about the accounting of profits in the modern age that need to be thought about and thought about in the context of the G20. We need to deal with facts.                 Dealing with the facts and dealing with the revenue write-downs that we have seen, Treasury are doing their best, their best projections after the GFC. We have seen huge write-downs from before the GFC. Then we have seen huge write-downs again that Treasury did not forecast and did not predict. In the circumstances of those write-downs, you have got a clear choice to make: do you focus on jobs and growth or don't you? This is the choice that we faced when the global financial crisis was at its height, and we as a government said, 'You focus on jobs and growth.' I respect that the opposition made the opposite decision, and that is their judgement call. They decided that the nation should not focus on jobs and growth, and that is why they opposed our economic stimulus package. So there is a divide here. We focus on jobs and growth. The opposition is committed to the opposite, to not focusing on jobs and growth.                 We are at another moment where a decision needs to be made: do you focus on jobs and growth? We are focusing on jobs and growth. If the member for North Sydney wants to lead the economic debate of the opposition once again into not focusing on jobs and growth, that is a matter for him, and he will be held to account for it. But there is nothing more important to this Labor government than the jobs of working people. We have put them first in the most difficult of economic days, and we will put those jobs first now.

  I thank the member for Blair for that question and for the opportunity to rise on my first day in this parliament as Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management. I just want to take the opportunity to say that I am very proud to serve the interests of the Australian people as Attorney-General in a Labor government. I will be guided by my principles and values, formed -                      I know that those opposite have no principles and no values, which is why they are laughing, but I will be served in this place by principles formed from long years of legal practice.                     I thank the member for Blair for his question. The member for Blair saw firsthand the damage caused by the 2011 Queensland floods, and he stood side by side with his community as they rebuilt. Floods and fires have affected communities around the country, but I want to focus on the state of Queensland, the state that the member for Blair is from, and that is because of the truly devastating impacts that there have been in the state of Queensland. The scenes following ex-Tropical Cyclone Oswald down the Queensland and the New South Wales coasts have been truly devastating - in the Bundaberg region in particular. On Australia Day, that area bore the brunt of this storm, with a series of separate tornadoes and more than 7½ thousand residents forced to evacuate their homes.                 Our government has moved very quickly to ensure that support was available for those most severely affected. We have activated our disaster response plan. In Queensland more than 300 Australian Defence Force personnel have been deployed to assist with the emergency response and recovery efforts led by ADF Joint Task Force 637 Queensland Flood Assist 2. We have paid almost $47 million in recovery support directly into people's bank accounts following requests from 40,200 applications from Queensland, with every eligible adult receiving $1,000 and $400 per child. The Prime Minister has also activated clean up and recovery grants of $25,000 for primary producers, for small businesses and for not-for-profit organisations in Bundaberg, North Burnett, Fraser Coast, Gympie and the Lockyer Valley. There are a further 53 local government areas eligible for help including personal hardship assistance, concessional interest rates, loans and freight subsidies for primary producers.                 As Australians, we take pride in our ability to pull together in a time of crisis. We have seen the mud army - referred to already today - of volunteers return to lend a helping hand, and I would echo -

  This morning I was with the member for Canberra, the member for Fraser and the member for Eden-Monaro at the beginning of construction of the Majura Parkway, which is the largest ever road project in the ACT. Recommended by Infrastructure Australia it will deliver benefits for the ACT economy of a billion dollars. It is part of the rollout of the Nation Building Program.                 Just in the last couple of weeks we have been getting on with the business of governing and opening the southern Sydney freight line to traffic. For 100 years it has been blocked and we have had to stop - indeed there has been a curfew - at Sydney regarding freight line to the port, fixed as a result of our investment. We have confirmed that the widening of the Great Eastern Highway in Perth will open six months ahead of schedule. We have awarded the contract to build the Gosford passing loops as part of the northern Sydney freight corridor upgrade. Last Friday I was with the member for Perth at the WA Gateway project. It is a billion dollar project and the biggest road project ever in WA. We have put funding towards the planning in the Prime Minister's electorate of the western interstate freight terminal that has the potential to take 700,000 trucks off the streets of Melbourne.                 We have opened the new heavy vehicle regulator office in Brisbane. We have opened the new rail safety regulator office in Adelaide. As a result of those programs, the national transport regulators will deliver $30 billion benefit to the national economy over 20 years. We have gone to the electorate of the member for Gellibrand to look at the regional rail link - the bridge over the Maribyrnong River and the work that is taking place there - which is the largest ever investment by any federal government in any public transport project in Australia's history. We have been getting on with the job of identifying the big infrastructure projects that are required to build productivity, support jobs, deal with issues such as urban congestion and we are making sure that they are properly funded with proper time lines so that they can keep our economy strong into the future.

  The government, of course, are extremely proud of the programs that we have put in place, funded by the carbon price, which is working and which contrary to all the doom and the gloom forecast by the Leader of the Opposition - the end of the world, Armageddon arriving, prices are going to be unimaginably -                      I certainly am endeavouring to be heard, Speaker, because it is an important message that needs to be registered with the other side and in the community, and that is that every claim made by the opposition leader about the impact of carbon pricing -                      The point that I am making is relevant to the question. Every single claim made by the opposition leader has been demonstrated to be false. What we have seen from the opposition - from the time that carbon pricing, an important economic and environmental reform, was announced - is the most mendacious campaign in our history. This is what it comes to: little questions from the backbench about an error in the department concerning documents for what the ANAO found were excellent programs - sound programs funded from carbon price revenue that are helping local governments, not-for-profit community organisations and many others in the community improve their energy efficiency. If that is all you can come up with, after all this, after the most mendacious campaign that we have seen - every claim demonstrated to be false. Unimaginable price increases - do you remember that claim? The December CPI figures were 0.2 per cent. The annualised rate is two per cent. Jobs are growing. The economy is growing. What happened to the campaign? He says it is all about trust. You cannot trust one word the opposition leader says.

  I thank the member for Fraser for his question and his interest in this important subject. This government has a plan for the future of this country in terms of its security and a plan for our economy and manufacturing. One prime example of that, of course, is the investment that we have made in force protection measures for our troops in Afghanistan. That included unmanned aerial surveillance systems. We have also invested in mine-clearing equipment, new lightweight combat body armour, new combat uniforms and longer-range machine guns. We have upgraded the Bushmaster vehicles so that they are now safer and, of course, the investment we have put into the counter-rocket-and-mortar-fire alert systems that are protecting our personnel in Tarin Kot. We have done this in cooperation with the Australian defence industry, which has the confidence of this government in its capacity and in its capability to deliver the equipment needs of our Defence Force.                 As an indication of our confidence, we have invested $445.7 million in programs specifically to assist the Australian defence industry to upskill. We are also interested in supporting their innovative abilities and assisting them to become more competitive internationally.                 One of the programs I am talking about is the Global Supply Chain. With that chain we have seen Australian companies win 195 contracts worth about half a billion dollars through that program, 90 per cent of the value going to small and medium enterprises. Australian SMEs are proving they can match it on the world stage, and we are confident in them. This will be important as we move forward to the future submarine program, which will be a major national program for this country in terms of the skills that it will develop and the flow-over benefit to Australian industry and, of course, the capacity of our shipbuilding industry. Of course, this has been done in close collaboration with industry. It is important that we have their input into the innovative and skills capacities that we will need in the future, and they have been a sound partner with us in this endeavour.                 I can confirm to the House that the commitment of this government to our defence industry, to our national security and to the men and women of our Australian Defence Force is ironclad.

  In the form of the question the Leader of the Opposition once again verifies - in case there was any doubt - that he doesn't know anything about economics and he doesn't know anything about the government's budget. He is following the shadow Treasurer into error here. It was the shadow Treasurer who first started trying to retail these figures, where he put together apples and oranges and pretended they were the same thing. It is nonsense when it comes out of the mouth of the shadow Treasurer and it is nonsense when it comes out of the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition.                 I would refer the Leader of the Opposition to the fact that, as a percentage of GDP, tax is lower under this government than it was under the Howard government - that is a fact. Of course we know that the Leader of the Opposition does not to like to confront facts which do not reinforce his prejudices - but that is a fact.                 I would also remind the Leader of the Opposition of another fact he frequently chooses to forget. The world has confronted the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression. That is a fact. It cannot be denied -                      No point screeching and carrying on about it: that is a fact. And there are millions and millions of working people around the world who are now in the despair of unemployment because that financial crisis happened and because it had consequences in the real economy, the global economy and the economies of nations.                 That means that our nation, at a time of global financial crisis - and think about those words carefully: global financial crisis - had to confront a few choices. First and foremost, what was going to happen, and what did happen because of the global financial crisis, was that there was going to be a huge hit to government revenues. The Leader of the Opposition likes to forget that. And, indeed, revenues have not recovered in the way the Treasury predicted. The Leader of the Opposition likes to forget that. That fact of course was always going to put pressure on the budget; it was always going to cause a deficit to arise. The Leader of the Opposition should have the honesty to acknowledge that.                 And then this government took the responsible position of putting jobs, opportunity and growth first; of making sure that a couple of hundred thousand Australians could stay in employment. I respect that the Leader of the Opposition made the opposite choice. He would have preferred to have seen those Australians unemployed. We did not; we supported their jobs and we are proud that we did. The Leader of the Opposition has to get out of economics kindy class and start dealing with the facts.

  I thank the member for his question. And I thank him, too, for his real interest in issues of reconciliation and advancement of Indigenous Australians in his own electorate. I have witnessed that with my own eyes.                 Today I was very pleased to be able to present to the parliament the fifth annual Closing the Gap statement. It is a very clear-eyed and factual account of where our nation is in trying to attain our Closing the Gap targets to make a real difference to the lives of Indigenous Australians, to make a real difference to things like life expectancy, educational attainment, employment and health - things we know will make a long-term difference to closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia.                  As a government we are 100 per cent committed to closing that gap but we are not romantic or starry-eyed about how difficult this is. It requires deep thinking, it requires consistent effort, it requires hard work and it requires partnerships around the country with state and territory governments, with Indigenous Australians, with their leadership and with communities around that nation. It requires that kind of effort to make a difference.                  But we can say to ourselves that a difference is being made. And I was very pleased to be able to report to the parliament that we have, on schedule, hit the first of the Closing the Gap targets, and that is to make sure that children in remote Australia - Indigenous children - get the benefit of preschool. And I was able to tell the parliament about a young girl called Curtisha who is now getting the benefit of preschool when her mother did not even get the opportunity to go to school. That is a change across a generation - a mother who missed out on school, a daughter getting to go to preschool and therefore being ready for school.                  But I also had to report to the parliament my very grave concerns that the policies of the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory are putting the alcohol industry first and Indigenous kids second. I have called on them to reinstate the banned drinkers list because we know that that was working. I want to confirm to the parliament today that Minister Macklin has written to Chief Minister Mills under powers granted to her by the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory Act to stop the reintroduction of alcohol to Indigenous communities without the approval of the minister.                 We need to stop the rivers of grog. We need to stop this going backwards in the Northern Territory. We need to sound the words of caution to Queensland and we need to maintain our focus on closing the gap.

  Let me explain this to the shadow Treasurer so that he can follow it. First and foremost, to the shadow Treasurer, let me explain to him: (1) as a percentage of GDP this is a far lower taxing government than the government he served in as the Work Choices minister; and (2) of course in my statement I was referring to the revenue write-downs against Treasury predictions. I refer him to the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. He may not have obtained a copy. He may not have read it but I suggest that he does.                 I am referring him to the revenue write-downs made transparent at that time by Treasury in its forecasts and referred to publicly by the Treasurer, Wayne Swan. I also refer him to the undeniable fact that as a percentage of GDP, per unit of GDP, revenue to government is at its lowest percentage now since the early 1990s and that recovery of revenue is happening more slowly than Treasury predicted. These are facts.                 I take it from this line of questioning that the opposition believes itself to be in a position to say that had it governed during the days of the global financial crisis it could have produced a surplus budget every year, notwithstanding the global financial crisis, notwithstanding what was happening in the global economy, notwithstanding the hit to revenues that flowed and the hit to revenues we are continuing to see flow.                  Well, if the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition truly think that that is the position they would have found themselves in if they were in government, and given that that is all dealing with past figures, there is no reason at all why tomorrow they could not walk into this parliament and table what they would have done in that budget situation to show surpluses across those financial years. Every fact, every figure is at their disposal. Let's not have the spin, the hysteria and the questions. Just come in tomorrow and table the document. And if they do not do that then let's not hear any of this nonsense ever again.

  I would say at the outset how wonderful it is today to see so many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around the corridors of Parliament House, so many people joining in the Reconciliation Australia showcase in the Great Hall. If anyone here has not been in to meet with some of the companies and organisations represented there today, they should do so.                  I thank the member for Greenway for her question and acknowledge her commitment, along with the government's, to make sure that we do everything possible to close the gap, because it is unacceptable that, in Australia today, we still have such a life expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. It is unacceptable that we see Indigenous children being born today still not having the same expectation of the long and healthy life of other children. It is something that this government has been determined to change. We know that that change does not come easily. As the Prime Minister has said, sometimes you can face setbacks but they require all of us together to be determined to make sure that we continue to progress towards our goals and not to let any of our progress be eroded.                 Our approach has enabled us to have very clear targets and goals with a timeline attached to them, with very clear investments attached to those timelines and a determination to work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to make sure we achieve our goals. As the Prime Minister outlined in her statement to the parliament today, we have met our first target - to make sure that all those little kids in remote Australia have the chance to go to preschool, like children in other parts of Australia; to make sure that a child born today is not going to die before they turn five; to make sure they get antenatal care and early childhood care; and to make sure that their mums and dads get the parenting help they need. We also can see from the report tabled today that we are on track to meet our targets with year 12 attainment, which is so important if we are to make sure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people get the jobs they need so that they can look after their families. We know we have an enormous amount to do. We will do it with clear and strong hearts -

  This government makes absolutely no apology for putting Australian jobs and Australian growth first - absolutely no apology. It is what drove us through the global financial crisis to support employment; it is what drove us through the global financial crisis to support small business. As a consequence, the Australian economy is now 13 per cent larger than it was at the end of 2007. What we have here is a Liberal Party that is constantly at war with the facts.                     At the end of last year there was an extreme bout of volatility in the global economy not dissimilar to what we had coped with some years before. The consequence of that was a very substantial revenue write-down. So I said to the Australian people that it was unlikely we would return to surplus in 2012-13, notwithstanding the fact that there is still a very strong fiscal consolidation going on in our balance. We are doing that because we put jobs and growth first. The proposition being put by those opposite is very simple. They are saying they would have cut government spending early this year in the face of the global volatility, thereby reducing growth and causing higher unemployment.                 The proposition at the heart of all of the questions asked here today and put forward by the Leader of the Opposition is this: they would have cut $160 billion worth of revenue write-downs from the Australian budget over the last five years - and I can tell you what the consequence of that would have been. That would have been a sledgehammer to the Australian economy and would have resulted in massive unemployment. It also would have resulted in higher deficits and higher debt. They want to have a debate about deficit and debt in this country. We are the party of growth and jobs; they are the party which will take a sledgehammer to the economy. We are seeing the leading edge of that now in the $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line -                      and the commitment by the Leader of the Opposition to abolish the Schoolkids Bonus and to take that money away from the Australian people.                 Leave not granted.

  I thank the member for Chifley for his question. I also thank the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for their speeches this morning on the Closing the Gap campaign and its targets. I also thank Minister Macklin for her response earlier on Closing the Gap. I come at this from a different perspective from many in this place. I have now lived in Alice Springs for 30 years and in the Northern Territory for 35 years. I have seen firsthand the impact that alcohol abuse has on my community and the people within that community. A significant proportion of the population living in that community and around Central Australia - indeed, across the Northern Territory - are Aboriginal people for whom alcohol is a problem.                 On 1 July 2011, when the former Henderson government introduced the Banned Drinkers Register, it was to much acclaim across the Territory. Indeed, there was strong support for it. What we discovered over a very short space of time, within three months, was that the alcohol related assaults across the Northern Territory were down 15 per cent. In Darwin and Palmerston alone they were down 20 per cent. We had 10,000 fewer antisocial behaviour incidents reported across the Northern Territory. So there was a significant impact on the Northern Territory community. We need to understand, from a public heath perspective, how important the control of alcohol consumption is and how its abuse hurts not only individuals but families. We have seen only recently work on foetal alcohol syndrome across Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. We know what the impact is.                 What the Northern Territory government has done since its election, as the result of an election campaign policy, is remove the Banned Drinkers Register. We have seen an immediate spike in drunkenness around Alice Springs. We have seen hordes of people lining up at bottlos and grog shops. It seems to me that a responsible person - and I note that the Leader of the Opposition very responsibly supported the Prime Minister's view and our view - would say that the Northern Territory government should reinstate the Banned Drinkers Register as a matter of urgency. Responsible people would say that it should be done, but unfortunately the Northern Territory government is acting irresponsibly, irrationally and against the best interests of the Northern Territory community. The best thing the Northern Territory government could do is recant on its decision to remove the Banned Drinkers Register and take other steps, in conjunction with us, to address alcohol abuse in the Northern Territory through the alcohol management plans and other measures which Minister Macklin has put in place.

On the government's budget and putting a priority on jobs and growth and supporting working Australians, I refer him to my earlier answers in question time today. On the question of providing information to the Australian community, the member might like to explain whether the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition generally will be issuing an apology for putting out a document that has stamped on it 'costed, fully budgeted' when there are no costings, no budget and no savings.

  I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. Our economy is now 13 per cent larger than it was at the end of 2007. That has outstripped almost every other advanced economy in the world. Also, we have contained inflation at 2.2 per cent, well within the Reserve Bank's target band; we have low unemployment, with a five in front of it, whereas around the world double-digit numbers are very common; we have a low cash rate of three per cent - far lower than at any time under the previous government; and of course we have a triple-A credit rating. We have a triple-A credit rating because that reflects the assessment of the global community of our strong public finances and our low debt.                 We have heard some reflections on these strong fundamentals in question time today. Those opposite do not accept these facts; they are in complete denial of these facts, showing that they are unqualified to run a $1.5 trillion economy. They have now joined the cranks and crazies of the US Tea Party in their critique of the Australian economy and in their denial of these basic facts about the strength of the Australian economy. This government will get on with the big reforms that will keep us growing. In our bones, in our DNA, are jobs and growth. The enduring mission of the Labor Party, as it was the enduring mission of Bob Hawke when he was in government, is to put in place the very big reforms that strengthen our economy for the future. All of that is challenged now by the cranks and crazies of the Liberal Party in Australia. The proposition they have put to the House today is a simple one - that in the face of the global financial crisis they would have cut spending by $160 billion. That would have been the revenue write-down we were coping with. That would have absolutely tanked the Australian economy and we would not be here today saying our economy is 13 per cent larger if those people opposite had been in charge of this economy over the past five years. The behaviour in the House today demonstrates how unqualified they are, how they lack the judgement, how they lack the temperament, to run a $1.5 trillion economy, with this silly critique that has at its heart the philosophy of the Tea Party in the US, which wants to take an axe to the social safety net and a sledgehammer to our economy. The precedent is in Queensland. That is what they are following - the approach of Campbell Newman. They have a Commission of Audit; they want to hide their big cuts to public expenditure in health and education because they do not understand the importance of jobs and growth.

  The member for Goldstein is at war with the facts yet again. I make this point: we have a triple-A credit rating, and that is not delivered to many countries in the global economy. We have received that rating from the three major global rating agencies, and we have a stable outlook. The claim from over there is that we have always had it, but we have not. This is a reflection of the underlying strength of our economy. But, sadly, they are so unqualified to run an economy that they come in here day in, day out and they go out into the community and talk down our economy - they talk down the resilience of the Australian economy, they distort the facts. It is sad that this is what has happened to the once great Liberal Party of Australia, populated now by the cranks and crazies of the Liberal Party who do not accept the basic facts of modern economic life.                 I was asked before about the surplus. I said last year, straight out, that because of revenue write-downs it was unlikely we would come to surplus in 2012-13. I do want to make this point, and I want to make it clearly: when the facts change, so do responsible governments. The stakes are really high, because when conditions in the international economy change the livelihoods of millions of Australian workers are on the line. What they want is a government that has the competence to make the judgements for jobs and growth. This government has got the competence to make the judgements for jobs and growth and you have proven during the last five years that you do not have that competence. You do not have that understanding. You do not have the knowledge of our economy and you do not know what you are doing, because the figures you have put forward today about tax levels are just wrong.                     I think is very important that we have a debate about economic policy based on the facts, and the facts are these: expenditure as a percentage of GDP is the lowest it has been in almost 30 years. The fact is that tax to GDP is quite low at the moment, far lower than it was under them - the highest taxing government in Australian history. Now, Sloppy Joe over there has made up this new figure claiming that the -                      Well, he cannot go round just joining figures together and amalgamating concepts.                     The fact is that those opposite, because they have got a $70 billion crater, have in store for the Australian people huge cuts, a sledgehammer to the economy, a $70 billion crater, that is going to cost jobs, cost growth and push up debt.

  I thank the member for Page for her question, and I know how strongly she has advocated the importance of this infrastructure need in her community. We understand one of the most important infrastructure spends this nation can make is connecting the nation through fast-speed broadband. We have had the policies in place to do it and it is rolling out in a significant way. Nowhere is this more important than in our regions. I must say, in all of the times that I go to our regions, I never get the debate there as to whether we need to spend this money. All I get is, 'When is it going to be rolled out?' and 'How fast is it going to be?' So, despite the negativism that is constantly being run on the other side, the regions are not buying it because they want the broadband and they want our policy because they know it will improve their community.                 For the member for Page's benefit as well as for all members of the House, I can announce that we have made a significant improvement to the speed of service in the regions. NBN's fixed wireless and long-term satellite services will be upgraded to provide broadband speeds of 25 megs download and five megs upload. This is a doubling and a quadrupling respectively of what had previously been announced so all services that are provided through that will have a significant improvement. If anyone doubts the significance of this, they should go to the regions and see how they are being serviced by these services now. There are the e-health options in places like Narrabri, which I visited, the e-education and e-health at the St Giles facility in Tasmania and the e-commerce facilities at Glen Innes in the New England electorate, where a photo business has relocated only because broadband is available.                 We get that and we understand why it is important to invest, but that is not what comes from the other side of this chamber. We have had a carping opposition and disunity, and they cannot even get their act together in terms of what the policy will be.                     Well may they laugh, Madam Speaker, but the regions understand the importance of this. The opposition have fought us every inch of the way when it comes to rolling out this service. They have sought to oppose us at every instant in this parliament. They have tried to block every piece of legislation. The difference between us and them is more than chalk and cheese. It is about kilobytes versus gigabytes. For those in the industry that understand it, they know that fully well and they will vote accordingly.

  I -                      Thank you, Speaker. I made the point before that, when the facts change, so do the actions of responsible governments. The lives of many people depend upon the decisions that we take in this parliament. I know that those opposite like to pretend that the global financial crisis never happened, that there was not extreme volatility in the global economy at the end of last year. They like to pretend that Europe did not go into recession last year, that there was not sluggish growth in the US, that there was not a question mark over China. They like to pretend that commodity prices did not crash 38 per cent between May and September. They just want to whitewash all of those basic facts away.                     We will always take the balanced decision to support jobs and growth, and that is what I talked about - at the end of last year, the impact on our budget of extreme global volatility and the fact that we lost in four months all of the revenue we had previously written down for 12 months. I went out and I said that, as a result of that, it would be unlikely that we would come to surplus. I also made the point very strongly that we are keeping in place a very substantial fiscal consolidation because we think that good, strict fiscal policy is the foundation of jobs and growth - and, by the way, also of healthy public finances, because you have to have good growth to have healthy public finances.                 Of course, I know that notion of economics is rejected by those opposite, who are at war, really, with 21st-century economics, do not accept that and now are putting a proposition to the Australian people that over the last five years we should have cut expenditure by $160 billion over and above the structural saves that we made in the budget. If they had had their way, during the global financial crisis Australia would have gone into recession, and much more deeply so, because apparently their view is now that there needed to be an extra $160 billion worth of cuts to make up for the revenue write-downs. That would have pushed unemployment through the roof and tens of thousands of small businesses into bankruptcy. That is where their policy position is leading.                 We as a government have always taken the tough decisions. We have been prepared to move when conditions have changed. We did that during 2008 and 2009 and put in place one of the most effective responses to the global financial crisis of any country in the developed world. The consequence of that today is an unemployment rate with a five in front of it. You look around the world, you look at other developed economies, and you see tens of millions of people unemployed, whole communities shattered. Here in Australia, yes, we do still live with the consequences of the global financial crisis, we live with the aftershocks, but we have the best set of fundamentals in the developed world and we are proud of it.

  It is great to have in this chamber today former Prime Minister Hawke, because he knows, just like everyone on the Labor side, that the only time superannuation ever gets lifted in this country is when Labor is in government. He knows how hard it was for the unions and the government to go to an accord to lift super from zero to three per cent. We saw Prime Minister Keating lift super from three to nine per cent across the following years, and he has also seen, under Prime Minister Gillard, superannuation lifted from nine to 12 per cent. We are the champions of superannuation in this House. We invented compulsory universal superannuation so that people do not retire poor. It is in the Labor DNA, and those opposite know it. And, whenever we try and improve superannuation, there is one thing you can always count on, as surely as night follows day: those representatives of vested interest, those opposite, always vote against it. Shame on them.                 What we have already done since 1 July last year, for 3.6 million Australians who earn less than $37,000 a year, is abolish the 15 per cent tax on superannuation that they paid. We abolished it - a tax cut for 3.6 million people who earn less than $37,000, the people who work part time, the working mums. So you can imagine my surprise at the National Press Club last week, when the opposition had a chance to rescue themselves from their fiscal stupidity of proposing to introduce a new tax on 3.6 million working Australians. Given the right choice or the wrong choice, that mob opposite never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity in superannuation.                 On Q&amp;A on Monday night, I thought they might bring in super rescue agent Christopher Pyne, the member for Sturt, to rescue them. David Bradbury skewered him. David Bradbury said:                 The policy that Tony Abbott confirmed at the National Press Club about the low income superannuation contribution.                 Christopher Pyne, in an act of confusion so consistent with Christopher Pyne, said, 'We haven't announced that.'                     Well, the opposition has announced it. Why don't you take a leaf out of Christopher Pyne's book and drop a tax on 3.6 million people? Take some advice from Christopher for once.

  I thank the member for Wentworth for his question, and I particularly thank him for it on a day when we are in a position to announce faster broadband for regional and remote Australia. I would remind the member for Wentworth that, as we roll out the National Broadband Network, we are delivering on our commitment of uniform national wholesale pricing for broadband services. The member for Wentworth should acknowledge that this means that people around the country - regional Queensland, to take one good example - will pay the same for NBN services as people in Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane. What this of course -                      I was addressing the question of pricing on the NBN and pointing out to the member for Wentworth the uniform national wholesale pricing that we are committed to delivering. Then, off this platform, of course, retail providers can compete and, as the member for Wentworth well knows, there are very competitively priced packages available to people in areas where we have rolled out the National Broadband Network. The member for Wentworth, in terms of this debate, really needs to explain to Australian consumers and people who have got the NBN or who are anxiously awaiting the delivery of the NBN what the alternative to the National Broadband Network is from the point of view of the opposition. As I understand it, they have announced 22 failed broadband plans and are now committed to ripping up services and prejudicing the ability of Australians and the Australian economy to get the jobs and opportunities of the future. So I say to the member for Wentworth: the National Broadband Network will continue to roll out with the wholesale pricing commitment that we have given and with the retail competitiveness that we are already seeing.

  I thank the member for Deakin for the question, because carbon pricing has now been in place, as he indicated, for just over six months, and it is an immensely important reform that has been made. It is economically responsible, it is environmentally effective and it is socially fair and equitable - and the facts on that are becoming perfectly evident. What is also becoming perfectly evident is the extent of the mendacity in the campaign that has been run by the coalition against carbon pricing. It has been one of the most deceitful campaigns we have ever seen, and it has demonstrated with absolute clarity that the Leader of the Opposition cannot be trusted on major public policy issues. Every statement he made in relation to this important reform has been demonstrated to be false.                  The opposition leader forecast unimaginable price increases, yet the CPI rose just 0.2 per cent in the December quarter. The annualised rate is just 2.2 per cent - at the bottom of the RBA parameters. The Leader of the Opposition also forecast the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs, yet unemployment stands at 5.4 per cent and over 29,000 jobs have been created since the introduction of carbon pricing. He said the carbon price would be a wrecking ball through the economy - a wrecking ball - yet Australia's annual economic growth rate, the rate of growth in GDP, is around three per cent. In the United Kingdom it is zero. In the US it is a bit under 1½ per cent. In Australia it is three per cent. We have introduced this reform that the opposition leader forecast would destroy the economy. He said that the carbon price would not work; it would not reduce emissions. Yet, now, after its first six months in operation, emissions in the National Electricity Market actually fell by 8.6 per cent - a reduction of 7½ million tonnes in pollution. There is more renewable energy being sold into the market and there is greater investment in renewable energy.                  There are a host of other statements, false, that have been made by the Leader of the Opposition on this issue, all of which demonstrate that he cannot be trusted. In fact, he has run the most negative, vicious, aggressive and destructive campaign for two years but he now claims to be Mr Positive - actually a sensitive guy, very sensitive, with a positive plan for the future. No amount of meaningless platitudes about non-existent positive plans can disguise the fact, and no image makeovers can disguise the fact, that the Leader of the Opposition cannot be trusted.

  I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question. I am very glad that we have moved to change superannuation so that 3.6 million Australians will have an ability to be up to $500 better off. I am very concerned. I presume the Leader of the National Party supports the Leader of the Opposition's plan to take those benefits away from 3.6 million low-income Australians, that he supports the Leader of the Opposition's plan to hit the retirement savings of people who earn less than $37,000 a year. So, when we are talking about superannuation changes, let us be very clear. Who has a plan for cuts that would hit millions of Australians? Who has a plan for the cruellest of cuts that would hit Australians on the lowest incomes? Who has a plan to cut the superannuation of women who work part time? The Leader of the Opposition. I am very glad that the Leader of the National Party has raised this question because it enables me to alert the Australian community to the danger to the superannuation of low-income earners posed by the Leader of the Opposition.                 As the Leader of the National Party would well know, Labor is the party that brought compulsory superannuation to this country. It was fought every step of the way with a fear campaign in which people were told the Australian economy would be destroyed. It reminds you of some more recent fear campaigns we have seen from the opposition. Universal superannuation was fought, and described as a con job, by this Leader of the Opposition. We are the political party that delivered it. We are proud of it. We are the political party that is increasing it and we are the political party determined to benefit low-income earners, whilst the Leader of the National Party and the Leader of the Opposition are there trying to take benefits away. I would also remind the Leader of the National Party that if he were paying any attention to the economic debate in this country, he would know we addressed questions of superannuation, including superannuation withdrawals, when we released the tax review in May 2010. I refer him to the media release which accompanied that report and said the government reaffirms that it will never remove tax-free superannuation payments for the over-60s. I refer him to that statement and I would ask him to please say to the Leader of the Opposition: 'Don't hurt 3.6 million Australians. Don't hurt the lowest income Australians in our country. Do not hurt these men and women.'

  I thank the member for Throsby for his question. I know he has a very keen interest in this area. Australia is a great trading nation. Boosting trade is critical to our success. One of the things that can threaten that is dumping. Dumping is cheating, pure and simple. It is where goods are imported at less than their real cost. That can cost Australians their jobs. It can hurt Australian industry and it can undermine the confidence that we all have in free trade. That is why it is important that we have a strong independent umpire with the powers and the resources needed to make sure that people play by the rules. That is why today I have introduced legislation to establish the Australian Anti-Dumping Commission. In the last couple of years we have seen that the workload of our anti-dumping investigators has tripled. This has been driven by a weak global economy, the strong Australian dollar, and the presence of a lot of commodities out there looking for a market. The advice that I have from my department is that this is expected to continue.                  Last year I asked John Brumby, the former Premier of Victoria, to provide me with advice on the best structure for Australia's antidumping administration. He provided me with a number of recommendations. We have committed to implement all of them. The two major recommendations that he made were the establishment of this commission and the allocation of additional resources for these investigators. We will do this. We will allocate an additional $24 million over four years, which will mean that we will almost double the number of antidumping investigators. This has been backed by business and it has been backed by unions. Innes Willcox of the Australian Industry Group said of these reforms to the system that they:                 _will strengthen its effectiveness, improve its administration and make anti-dumping procedures more accessible for all affected businesses.                 They are important reforms, but more work is needed. In the next session I will introduce legislation to impose higher duties when rules are broken, increased infringement notice penalties and make it easier for antidumping duty to be applied retrospectively. These will, of course, comply with our WTO obligations. The purpose of all of this is to make sure that people play by the rules. To do that you need a strong, independent umpire with the powers and resources they need. That is what we are doing. The Australian Anti-Dumping Commission will help support Australian jobs, support Australian workers and help Australian industry. That is what this government is all about.

  I know the shadow Treasurer is highly embarrassed by the fact that he was part of what is the highest-taxing government in Australian history and that now, comparatively, our levels of expenditure as a percentage of GDP are quite low. That is the point that I made. We have put in place very strict expenditure control in the most difficult of circumstances. When you were in government you went on a spending spree - you pushed the expenditure ratio through the roof and you also pushed the tax-to-GDP ratio through the roof. What was the outcome of that? Ten interest rate rises in a row.                 So we are happy to have a debate about growth and jobs, about who has got the policy framework to support employment, because there are millions of Australians depending on the judgements that are made in this House.                     Those opposite have a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line, and the first group that is going to pay for that is parents and schools, because those opposite are going to abolish the Schoolkids Bonus. Then they are going to get rid of the tripling of the tax-free threshold. Then they are going to move on and rip away superannuation benefits for low-paid workers. I think all Australians can see that there is an agenda on that side of the House to take the axe to the social safety net and a sledgehammer to our economy. On this side of the House, we stand for growth and jobs and a sensible and balanced economic policy that brings prosperity to all Australians. On that side of the House, they stand for a savage attack on the living standards of low- and middle-income earners in this community. That is what is going to play out as we go through this year and there is a straight comparison between the success of this government in managing the economy and the incompetence on the other side of the House.

  I thank the member for Werriwa for his question and his long interest in these matters. Border protection, asylum seekers and these issues can be challenging for any government. These issues for any government, in any community, can be fraught. Failing to heed expert advice can potentially be fatal. I need no convincing of the importance of listening to expert advice, after being Minister for Home Affairs for 2½ years. On one particularly memorable occasion for me, on 15 December 2010, I arrived on Christmas Island only hours after one of the most tragic maritime disasters in recent times, where 50 people - men, women and children - perished when a vessel foundered on the rocks on Christmas Island. Forty-one people were rescued, 40 of whom were plucked from the sea by very brave and courageous naval and Customs personnel. On that day, if I had had any doubt at all before, I knew it was critical that this country found the most effective means to deter vessels from coming to our shores in this manner. That underlined to me the need to bring about changes to ensure the most comprehensive approach we could possibly take and to heed the advice of our agencies and others to ensure that we did not see further lives lost.                 We commissioned experts, three very eminent Australians: Michael L'Estrange, extraordinary public servant, former Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, former High Commissioner to the United Kingdom; Paris Aristotle, with more than 20 years experience in dealing with refugee settlement and these complex issues; and Angus Houston, former Chief of the Australian Defence Force, appointed by the Howard government and reappointed by this government to that office. Those three eminent Australians came to a position, from different perspectives, and made 22 recommendations. At the centre of those recommendations was ensuring that we did not see any further lives lost at sea.                 I say to the Leader of the Opposition, who has said he wants to be positive and wants to have the coalition act as an alternative government, and has said he has consulted with experts: consider once again the 22 recommendations that have been outlined by these eminent Australians. Without his reconsidering that position, I am afraid, and this government is afraid, we will see further deaths at sea, we will see more infants carried up the shore on Christmas Island, as we saw on 15 December 2010. I implore the opposition leader to be positive and think of those children.

  Once again the Leader of the Opposition comes to the dispatch box and shows his inability to deal with economic concepts and economic facts. I would direct the Leader of the Opposition to the current inflation rate. I would direct the Leader of the Opposition to the Reserve Bank's remarks about the low level of the current inflation rate. I would direct the Leader of the Opposition to those facts, something that the Leader of the Opposition is not overly familiar with. What the Leader of the Opposition would recognise if he looked at the facts is that we have low inflation; we have low interest rates; we have a government that has been prepared to work with families and pensioners to assist them with their cost of living, whether it is our historic pension increase, whether it is our changing of the tax-free threshold so that working people, particularly working women, can earn -                      I am directly on the question, because the Leader of the Opposition asked about the government's budget strategy and cost-of-living pressures and impacts for low-income Australians and for pensioners. That was the question, so I am talking about cost-of-living pressures for pensioners and low-income earners. I am pointing out that we have low inflation and low interest rates. We have provided a historic increase to pensioners. We have provided a change in the tax arrangements which means that low-income workers - and they tend predominantly to be women - can earn $18,200 before they pay a dollar of tax. And then, of course, if they are buying a family home, they are also in the circumstance where they are paying $5,000 less for a $300,000 mortgage than they used to when those opposite were last in government. So, in terms of cost of living, in terms of working with pensioners and low-income Australians, I refer the Leader of the Opposition to the facts - to the clear economic concepts and to the facts.                 On the government's budget: nothing asked by the Leader of the Opposition and nothing asked by the shadow Treasurer actually would cause an observer to conclude that they know that a global financial crisis happened and that they recognise that, as a result of that global financial crisis and other pressures in our economy, we have seen huge revenue write-downs - indeed, $160 billion in revenue write-downs across the period of the GFC. You have to ask yourself the question in those circumstances: do you support jobs? We always will. When the Leader of the Opposition has been called on to come into this place and put his hand up for jobs, he never has.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question and I thank her for her continuing concern for people in her constituency and her focus on their opportunity, on jobs, on their ability to start and succeed in a small business and also on the things that go to support the modern families who live in her electorate with the pressures of day-to-day life.                 The member for La Trobe asks a very important question. First and foremost, let me say this: we as a nation are a strong nation and we are a smart nation. I am tired of the discourse in our national life that talks those attributes down. We have always been a nation which has presented strong in the world. We have always been a nation that has been smart and been able to bring clever solutions to complex problems. Indeed, our history is one of doing that. As a strong and smart nation, we have always aspired to be a fair nation. That is why this nation has been constructed around, and its national ethos is attached to, great Labor reforms like our introduction of the pension, like our introduction of Medicare, like our introduction of universal superannuation and like the fair workplace laws we will always believe in.                     And the dismissive attitude of those opposite to key concepts of fairness like the old age pension is well and truly on display.                 As a strong, smart nation, we have to ask ourselves, in a world that requires sophisticated thinking, in a world that needs real plans and costed solutions: what is the best way forward as our nation needs to confront a high and sustained dollar which is impinging on competitiveness and economic diversity, as our nation faces challenges like how we can best support those with disability, how we can ensure our kids get the best start in life and the best education in the world? As you confront these challenges, you are called upon to think through for real plans with real costings and real details, not to float ideas that, on their face, are absurd -                      and would hurt families around the nation, not to put into the public domain ideas that actually do not even pass the laugh test -                      do not have detail, do not have any costings and are aimed at hurting families. This government will always focus on the real things that matter to our nation and making sure we do the smart thinking that delivers the solutions for our country. I want us to be stronger in the future. I want us to be smarter in the future. I want us to be fairer in the future. That is our aim and that is what we are intent on delivering.

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for that question, because this government makes no apology for putting jobs and growth first. We have got the employment figures out today. There have been 850,000 jobs created in this country under this government. That has happened under the most difficult of circumstances - a global financial crisis and then, at the end of last year, another bout of global volatility. In the second part of year, we saw Europe go into recession, we saw a question mark about Chinese growth and we saw slight growth in the United States. In those circumstances, the performance here in the Australian economy, unlike other developed economies, has been second to none - 850,000 jobs.                 The Leader of the Opposition was asking before about cost of living. Let me tell you this. When it comes to cost of living, the most fundamental thing that a family needs is a job. Those opposite do not get that connection between living standards and jobs, because, if they did get that connection between living standards and jobs, they would not put forward the absurd proposition that right now we should be cutting economic growth and cutting jobs, and they most certainly would not be putting forward the fact that they, in their budget strategy, have to cut the budget by a further $70 billion. That would hit growth and it would hit jobs.                     Putting forward the proposition in the way that he has, he is making the Tea Party look rational! The facts are these. When conditions in the global economy change, so too do responsible governments, and this government, at the end of last year, made the judgement that to cut further in the budget would hit growth and it would hit jobs. Because our No. 1 priority is economic growth and jobs, we are not going to go through and cut as they propose. That is what they are proposing: that you do not change in response to global economic conditions - you just continue going down the same road - which is why they are such a danger to our economy, because their proposal now is to cut $70 billion, at least, from the budget. If you are going to take their propositions logically, that is what the shadow Treasurer is saying. That would mean a Newman-style attack on health and education in the Australian economy.                     That would push up unemployment in our community dramatically. That is the type of fiscal policy which is being put forward by the opposition.

  I welcome the question from the member for Reid. There are deep-seated challenges still in the global economy. There is international uncertainty and we are still living with the aftershocks of the global financial crisis. We can see that across Europe. Our economy, in the face of those uncertain conditions globally, is resilient. We can see this in the unemployment data out today. Unemployment is at 5.4 per cent, which is low and unchanged from last month. As I said before, something like 850,000 jobs have been created in this country under this government. Everyone on this side of the House is proud of that achievement.                 That has been done in the face of very substantial global headwinds, as we all know. As the Prime Minister said at the Press Club last week, the high dollar weighs down on our economy. Despite the fact that commodity prices have come off, we still have a high dollar weighing down on parts of the economy. The uncertainty around the global economy produces a cautious consumer. That is also reflected in the economy. These are very substantial headwinds when it comes to the hiring of workers. That is why this employment performance is so remarkable. We have more people in work than ever before.                 This is one of the reasons why our economy is 13 per cent bigger than it was at the end of 2007. Compare that to the British economy, which is four per cent smaller. That is an indication of how the macroeconomic framework and policies that have been put in place in this country have worked so well over the past five years. We have contained inflation, which is at 2.2 per cent, as the Prime Minister said before. There is also a low cash rate of three per cent, lower than at any time under those opposite and under half what it was when they left office. They left a legacy of 10 interest rate rises in a row.                 What we know is that we have to keep building on that success during the global financial crisis and look forward. That is why we have put in place the Asian century white paper, so we can maximise the opportunities that flow from growth in the region. We are making the investments in skills and education, we are investing in the NBN and above all, we are putting in place a fiscal policy that supports growth and jobs. The fiscal policy advocated by those opposite is one that will put a sledgehammer right through our economy. It will push unemployment up. When that happens, deficit and debt are pushed up. That is the contrary proposition that is being put by the shadow Treasurer.                 We have seen today the complete debacle of the so-called policy on Northern Australia, some thought bubble from Gina Rinehart adopted holus bolus by those opposite. That just shows you how sloppy they are when it comes to policy making.

  I am wondering where the shadow health minister is when it comes to this question. There has not been a cut, despite what has been suggested by the member opposite.                     What this government has done every year over the past five years and what we will do every year over the next five years is put in place a responsible fiscal policy that supports jobs and growth.                     Those opposite do not understand that to take good public policy decisions you have to take into account the facts. When facts change in the global economy or in the national economy, responsible governments change their policy to support growth and jobs. That is what this government has done and will continue to do. When we changed policy at the height of the global financial crisis to support employment, we were opposed every step of the way by those opposite. If they had had their way, tens of thousands of small businesses would have hit the wall and a couple of hundred thousand Australians would have been unemployed - more Australians out of work.                 Just as they advocated that approach then, they are now projecting that approach forward right now.                 At the end of last year, there was a bout of instability in the global economy and commodity prices tumbled dramatically. All of that had an impact on our revenues, and we have taken the responsible and balanced decision to support economic growth by not cutting to make up for that loss of revenue. But those opposite are in complete denial. They say that we did not lose $160 billion during the global financial crisis. They just say that it did not happen. Well, it did happen. It has impacted upon our budget and, in the face of that, we supported jobs and growth.                 They are now saying that what they would do is, at a minimum, hack away at the budget to the tune of at least $70 billion; the shadow Treasurer fessed up to this on breakfast television. He sat there beside the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities and admitted that, even at that stage, there was a $70 billion hole. What we see here is a dangerous proposition from the Liberal Party of taking a sledgehammer to the economy by cutting at least $70 billion. That is one of the reasons why they will not put forward costed policies. They want to do a Campbell Newman and get through this year without admitting what their policies are so that, if they are elected, they can take a sledgehammer to the economy afterwards.

  I thank the member for Lyne for his question. I am aware from discussions with him that there is much excitement at this 100-year anniversary in his electorate in towns like Gloucester and Taree, including people coming to the train stations for some special celebrations wearing period costumes and the like. I hope people enjoy those celebrations, as 100 years of rail is worth celebrating.                 I can assure the member for Lyne, as he enjoys those celebrations, that we are getting on with the job of building for the next century. We are rolling out the largest, most extensive modernisation of the nation's interstate rail network in almost a century. Our unprecedented capital works program is currently rebuilding more than a third of the 10,000-kilometre interstate rail freight network. Indeed, we have increased rail spending tenfold compared to the days of the Howard government.                 I will give you some examples of what has been and is being achieved. On the Perth to east coast line, we have already cut travel times by nine hours. As a result of that, Star Track Express and Australia Post are now moving things from road to rail - a great development. On the north-south line, we are on track to cut travel times by seven hours between Melbourne and Brisbane. Just last week, we opened the Southern Sydney Freight Line. This week, contracts are being let for the Northern Sydney Freight Line. All of this means that we have seen supermarket chains, like Woolworths, decide to transfer 34,000 tonnes of dry goods, once again, from road to rail - a great development.                 I know that the member is very supportive of further public transport projects. I can assure him that this federal Labor government is committed to public transport. Indeed, we have committed more resources to public transport than all other previous federal governments since Federation combined. We are getting on with the appropriate studies of high-speed rail, because we understand that this could be a game changer for our nation - that is, a high-speed rail network that could potentially service Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney and Brisbane and is of importance in New South Wales, including the people that the member for Lyne represents in this place. We have already released the first part of that study. The second part of that study will be released later this year. This shows that we are planning for the nation's future, not just for the next five years but for the next five decades.

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question, as she is a tremendous advocate of the people of Western Sydney and, like all members of the Gillard government, she understands the modern pressures that families are facing across this country. That is why we have put in place a number of targeted policies to assist families and to ease those cost-of-living pressures. We have put in place a schoolkids bonus, we have increased assistance to families, we have provided tax cuts, tripling the tax-free threshold, and we are increasing superannuation.                 While this government is out there putting in place policies that will assist families, those opposite have already flagged their intention to take a meataxe to these assistance measures. They have announced two policies so far and both of them are an attack on working families. In the first one they want to rip away the schoolkids bonus. In the second one they want to jack up taxes on the superannuation of the lowest paid Australian workers. But, of course, lots of pamphlets and two policies does not make a plan. It does not make a plan, and there is increasing pressure on them to reveal full details of what they want to take to the election.                 Indeed, it is no surprise that they do not want to tell the Australian people what it is they intend to do. We saw today with the release - or should I say the embarrassing leak - of their policy on Northern Australia exactly why they want to keep their policies a secret.                      This is a plan that will divide Australia. It is a plan that will relocate tens of thousands of jobs from places like Western Sydney to the far north of Australia. The message that the coalition is sending to those families in Western Sydney is: 'You either pack up your bags and pack up your family and move to the far north if you want to keep your job; or, if you're not prepared to do that, we'll jack up taxes so that we can fund billions of dollars of white elephant infrastructure projects in the north of Australia.                    The member for                    Dawson                    then left the chamber.                     Thank you, Speaker. I direct the member to ask that question of his frontbench. The fact they have not shared their policy with him yet is not my problem. This is a plan that will increase taxes on people in places like Western Sydney in order to fund white elephant infrastructure projects that have not yet even been conceived. As a result of this policy, we will see gold-plated footpaths in Karratha while people are stuck in traffic gridlock in places like Western Sydney. They talk about real solutions but, I tell you what, if you ever get to see their policies, you will see they have got nothing but real problems for the Australian people.                  Leave not granted.

  I thank the Deputy Leader for her question. It does seem to me, having watched the progress of question time, that one would be forgiven for wondering what is the difference between the old negative opposition and this supposed new look number. I think the answer is the colour of the Leader of the Opposition's tie. I also thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for verifying that those opposite are so concerned by the poor performance of their economic team that they are now swinging others in to try and hold the economic argument. I did think it was unfair when the deputy leader lost her job as shadow Treasurer and I thought that she would do a far better job. So I am glad she is back on the economic questions. However, unfortunately, on this economic question -                      Thank you very much. Thursday sense of humour. On the question that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked, let me be very clear in the answering of it. The opposition, we know, is full of climate change deniers. Now it is apparently full of global financial crisis deniers.                 They are in denial of the facts about the federal budget and the circumstance of the global economy and the outworkings of the global financial crisis. What they are in particular denial about is revenue write-downs, which have become transparent recently, and the fact that the amount of revenue per unit of GDP is lower than was expected by Treasury and, indeed, is lower than at any time since the early 1990s. Treasury, using the normal economic models and the economic personnel that the Howard government relied on in office, did their best to project where revenue would be and the economy has not performed in accordance with those expectations in the generation of revenue.                 That means that, as a government, you have a clear choice. You could seek to match those revenue write-downs with further budget cutbacks. That is a choice that would be available to you. I refer the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to the write-downs in MYEFO, for example, which were in the order of $4 billion this year. You could choose to cut $4 billion out of the budget to match that revenue write-down. The problem is that it would be a major risk for jobs and growth to take a policy position of matching those revenue write-downs with further savings. So that is not the policy position the government has taken. We are dealing with a real world with real facts and, most importantly of all, real consequences for Australian families and their ability to get and hold a job. We have elected to make sure we manage the economy to maximise the ability of Australians to have good work.

  I thank the member for Lyons for another policy question from the government side of the House. It is now 1,095 days since I had a question from the opposition, which is the time it took Ferdinand Magellan to circumnavigate the world.                 This report, Australia in the Asian century, is a white paper that is very complex and very detailed and took an enormous amount of thought and effort. It sets out a plan for Australia and it has special relevance to regional Australia. It indicates the government's confidence that we can develop regional Australia in responsible ways to help make areas such as Northern Australia a food bowl for Asia. That is our commitment. We have here in our midst the minister for regional development, who, on the back of this report, will be holding the Northern Australia Ministerial Forum this year in order to further develop and implement the policies that have been well thought out in this document.                     Dr EMERSON:                     I am being interjected upon, of course, by the shadow finance minister, who interjected earlier when it was suggested that he had 49 policies, fully costed, with nice covers, in his drawer. The first policy that made its way out was leaked because of the disaffection within his own policy unit about the crazy policies - the wacky policies - that the coalition has articulated in this leaked document. He said that they were fully costed with nice covers. Costed? This is an enormous potential cost running into tens of billions of dollars. That means infrastructure would be denied Western Sydney and the capital cities of this country. They are completely wacko ideas - and that is obviously the case in the view of members of the coalition policy team in order for this to have been ventilated in the way that it has.                 We have in the Leader of the Opposition a policy lightweight. We have in the Leader of the Opposition someone who gives no attention to detail. He says he has policies; he only has slogans. Into this so-called policy, you put one part in from Gina Rinehart, one part in from Joh Bjelke-Petersen and one part in from Tony Abbott, stir it around and what have you got? Troppo Tony - Troppo Tony has developed here a completely wacky policy.                     Dr EMERSON:                     I withdraw.                     Dr EMERSON:                     Here comes Karratha Chris!                     Dr EMERSON:                     If you want detailed, well thought out policy, here it is: a white paper on Australia in the Asian century. If you want thought, effort and costed policies, look to this side of the chamber, because you will never find them in the wacky economics of those opposite.

  Of course I share the chief whip's concern about aspirational Australians. Of course I share his concern and the concern of the Labor team about Australians around the nation. Consequently, I share their very deep concern that their superannuation, the superannuation of lowest income Australians, is to be cut by the Leader of the Opposition.                 It seems to me that the political trick here needs to be made transparent to the Australian people. What the Leader of the Opposition has done, in a sea of platitudes and slogans where he does not announce policies, does not make available savings and does not make available costings, is to decide to sharpen up on one cut. I think when you do that it really says something about your values.                 So in a circumstance where he will not be clear, where he is trying to fudge it, trying to get away from any detail on jobs and health and education and infrastructure, he sharpens up on one cut and that one cut is to the superannuation of 3.6 million of our lowest-income Australians - and 2.1 million of them are women. These are the ones on the chopping block for the Leader of the Opposition. He wants them to be disadvantaged. He has announced that crystal clear. Then, to try and cover up the fact that he is hitting these low-income Australians - 2.1 million of them are low-income earning women, probably part-time income earners, balancing work and family life - he then some time later issues the mealy words that there will not be further changes. When you have already hacked into 3.6 million Australians, I am not surprised you would then say no further changes - the evil work has already been announced.                 From the point of the view of the government, let me be very clear: we have always believed in superannuation. When the Leader of the Opposition was describing it as a con, when the Liberal Party was campaigning against it as something that would destroy the economy, we believed in it. We delivered it because it is good for working Australians and it is good for the nation. The way in which it has been good for the nation has been incredibly transparent during the global financial crisis. Having done that good work for the nation, in government we are adding to it with a change from nine to 12 per cent. We will never join with you in hitting the 3.6 million lowest-income Australians. We will never join with you in targeting 2.1 million working women. They may be the kind of targets the Leader of the Opposition aims at but, for us, we believe in benefiting working women and in benefiting working Australians.

  I thank the member for Canberra for her question. As a champion for the public service and a champion for this city, it is not surprising that the member for Canberra would have been alarmed to say the least when she saw the newspapers this morning. The policy announcement - or leak - from those opposite this morning, which has been roundly discredited and laughed at around the country since its original publication, actually contains some pretty appalling, very old ideas demonstrating yet again the intellectual desert that is opposition policy making.                  In contrast, as we have heard, the government has a clear and substantial framework containing policies such as the Australia in the Asian century white paper announced by the Prime Minister in October. The opposition's simplistic thought bubble of arbitrarily relocating substantial parts of the Australian Public Service comes after its repeated statement it will axe 12,000 jobs from the Australian Public Service. That is bad policy followed up by stupid policy.                 There are 168,850 federal public servants, with a great majority of them working and living in major and smaller centres outside of Canberra. All of these public service positions are under threat under the opposition's grand plan to transport components of federal departments and agencies north of the Tropic of Capricorn. Let us be clear: nearly 60 per cent of the nation's public servants live outside of Canberra, as they should, to deliver efficient and effective services to the Australian population.                 There are 22,300 public servants based in Sydney alone and over 23,000 in Melbourne. There are nearly 12,000 in Brisbane, 9,400 in Adelaide, over 6,600 in Perth and over 3,300 in Hobart. There are public servants living and working in numerous regional centres from Bundaberg to Bunbury. The location of Australian public servants is about effective, efficient service delivery. In 2012, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development declared that the Australian Public Service was an exemplar of public service efficiency. The OECD said that Australia is an example for all other nations to follow, including the Netherlands, Denmark, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, for efficient public services.                 It is important to note that just this week we had a Liberal senator make the point that Canberra will need to have a champion should there be a Liberal government elected. A Liberal senator made that statement. That Liberal senator made that statement because of his concerns for the job losses of what we are told so far to be 12,000 public servants.                      We are told also that they will be going to Northern Australia, how stupid.

  As I made clear in my last answer, if anybody in this parliament is concerned about superannuation and low-income earners then they must protest the Leader of the Opposition's plan to disadvantage low-income earners - more than three million of them, 2.1 million of them women. Everybody who says they are concerned must go to the Leader of the Opposition and say that this is wrong. I trust the member who asked the question has done that and will refuse to support it here in this parliament and in his electorate where he will declare that the Leader of the Opposition is wrong. He should particularly declare that the Leader of the Opposition is wrong because this superannuation cut, hitting as it does low-income Australians, hitting as it does predominantly women, would be hitting the same people that the Leader of the Opposition wants to rip the Schoolkids Bonus off as they try to get their kids to -                      I am referring to the question of superannuation for low-income earners. It seems to me amazing indeed that the member for North Sydney and the member who asked the question can feign concern about the circumstances of low-income earners when they will go to the next election asking those low-income earners for their vote knowing that they are going to deliver a superannuation reduction to them - more than three million of them, predominantly women. No doubt they will be trying to cover that up and not actually looking into their eyes and saying, 'I want you to be worse off,' but of course that is what they want. I point out that their wanting of low-income earners to be worse off is compounded by the plan to take away the Schoolkids Bonus, which would make families around $15,000 worse off over their children's journey through school. I say to the member who asked the question that he should be protesting the Leader of the Opposition's plan. That is the right thing to do. He should acknowledge that Labor invented superannuation, that Labor is increasing contributions from nine per cent to 12 per cent, that Labor has always delivered the important retirement income changes for Australians and that it is Labor in these circumstances, where hard-hitting cuts are proposed against low-income Australians, who will fight this change because it is wrong.

  I thank the member for Page for raising this important issue in parliament today. For a long time the member for Page, together with the member for Richmond, has raised concerns on behalf of communities in northern New South Wales about the impact of coal seam gas. Members of this House need to understand that what is happening in New South Wales is quite different from what is happening in other states. In states like Queensland there are exclusion zones around the settled areas, preventing the serious loss of groundwater through coal seam gas exploration and extraction from having an impact on urban areas. When I dealt with the proposals in Queensland, advice came back about concerns about subsidence, where land height significantly drops after water has been extracted. In terms of environmental impact on endangered species or something like that, the impact is minimal, but if you are talking about a settled the area where ground subsidence occurs under people's homes, under schools and under roads, the impact is far more serious.                  In New South Wales, instead of it being only in areas well away from settled areas, there are proposals not only in New England which have had a lot of publicity but also on the far north coast of New South Wales, in the Hunter, in the Illawarra and in Western Sydney. So the government, in putting forward the national partnership agreement, has put forward the money for the states to make sure that, for their processes, independently paid for science has to be locked into informing their planning decisions.                    The member for Macarthur then left the chamber.                     Queensland has signed up to that, Victoria has signed up to that, South Australia has signed up to that, but New South Wales asked for a protocol that is different from every other state to make sure that not every proposal is going to be caught.                   The member for Herbert then left the chamber.                     I table a letter I sent yesterday to Premier Barry O'Farrell. It is simply not good enough to have a situation where one state is wanting to make sure that the scientific checks are not done for them. There are some issues which currently do not fall within the ambit of federal legal powers but make a massive difference to the community. The member for Lyne is another who has been raising issues to do with his community. Member after member in different parts of New South Wales have been raising these issues. They fall within the jurisdiction of state responsibility but they are a massive issue. The federal government has put down the money to make sure the scientific work can be done. For some reason - and you can all work out your own conclusions as to why - Barry O'Farrell does not want that information to inform planning decisions in New South Wales.

  To the member who asked the question, I remind her first and foremost that superannuation is compulsory in this country because of a Labor initiative and a Labor plan, resisted every step of the way by the Liberal Party and the subject of a mammoth and irresponsible fear campaign. That is something the member would be familiar with, having been a member of this parliament during another irresponsible fear campaign over carbon pricing. There is only compulsory superannuation because of the actions of Labor. Having invented compulsory superannuation for this country, we have seen the benefits that it brings working people as well as the ballast it gives our economy. It creates a huge pool of national savings and that pool of national savings is very important, particularly during difficult economic times, and was very important during the global financial crisis. We, as the party of superannuation - the party that invented it - will always be the party that nurtures it and nurtures it well, which is why we are increasing superannuation contributions from nine to 12 per cent and why we will also make the right decisions to ensure that the superannuation scheme in our country meets our nation's needs.                 If the member opposite is truly concerned about superannuation and the plight of people in her electorate who are low-income earners, let me give her an example of that. It might be a mum who has been at home with two children - maybe one school-age, one pre-school age. She is deciding to go back to work part-time. Because she is a part-time worker, she is not a high-income earner, but she will want something in her superannuation when she retires. Maybe she might consider the position of that electorate member of hers -                      I am dealing with a question on superannuation and its future and answering that. I indicate to the member she may, when she next meets a constituent - a woman like that, in that position - try to explain why she wants to hurt that woman's superannuation.

  I thank the member for Blair for the question. In doing so, I indicate that there has been absolute cooperation between the Australian government and the Northern Territory government with respect to how we can put together agreement to guarantee the continued operation of the Pacific Aluminium refinery at Gove. This is an exceptionally important opportunity for the local community. When you think about the history of Gove, built in the late 1960s and 70s, it is akin to the construction of the Gorgon LNG project on Barrow Island at the moment. It was built in a remote area of Australia on the basis of a freely available resource, which since then has sustained the community of Nhulunbuy. We all appreciate that aluminium prices in recent times have declined significantly. The problem for Pacific Aluminium is that since its initial opening it has been fuelled by diesel, and the huge cost of diesel at the moment has added to the woes of Pacific Aluminium with respect to the continued operation of this refinery.                  For those reasons Pacific Aluminium has been engaged in discussions with me and the Northern Territory Chief Minister over recent months to try and work out if we can facilitate the availability of gas to Gove. This is not only important to the local community, which relies on the 1,100 jobs - both direct and indirect - but it also creates a very valuable opportunity for further economic development in the Northern Territory. If we guarantee the gas supply, then we will double the size of the gas market. That will bring on huge exploration, both onshore and offshore, from multinational companies, such as Eni and Total, leading Australian companies such as Santos, and emerging gas companies such as Amor Energy and Butu Butu. It will also create the opportunity for retail competition in the gas market to the benefit of industrial operatives and, I might say, ordinary consumers. If you get an increased supply of gas, you then get the opportunity to attract further investment and jobs in Northern Australia. It is a practical example of what real policy hard work is about - well thought out, delivering on the ground and in a practical way.                  I therefore urge the Northern Territory Chief Minister in his discussion with Pacific Aluminium at the head office of Rio Tinto in London tomorrow to think very seriously about making the necessary gas available. We will not have a shortage of gas in the years to come. Making this hard decision now is imperative, not only for the community of Gove and those direct and indirect employees, but also for all those small businesses that depend on the operation of Gove. I simply say that this is a decision that must be made. Once made, we will be able to move to the next process of consideration of whether we can assist in underwriting the construction of the pipeline. It is good for the Northern Territory and it is good for Australia. I simply say to the Chief Minister, 'You have our support in making this decision.'

  I genuinely thank the member for his question, because it enables me to address an irresponsible campaign by the Victorian government to try and hide the impact of its health cuts on Victorian hospitals and the Victorian community. So, I genuinely thank the member for his question, because I believe it is very important that people have the facts. The facts are these. Health funding to Victoria from this government will be increasing by $900 million. Let me say that figure again: $900 million.                  For those who prefer to think in percentages, that is a 26 per cent increase over the next four years - from $3.6 billion to $4.5 billion. That is $900 million up - 26 per cent up.                 So you ask yourself: if there is an extra $900 million coming across these years - going from $3.6 billion to $4.5 billion, a 26 per cent increase from this government - why are Victorians having to suffer hospital cutbacks? I will explain what the answer is. The answer is that the Victorian Liberal government has chosen to slash $616 million from health services. They are engaged -                      I know the facts do not suit you, but those are the facts.                     Let us go through it again: $900 million up from us; $616 million down from the Victorian government. Why are there cutbacks in Victoria? It is because of Victorian government cuts. Did Premier Baillieu need to do that? I remind the House and the people of Victoria that, in terms of sources of revenue - and this is not the only source for Victoria; it is just one example - Victoria is receiving a GST windfall of an additional $286 million over the next four years. Despite that GST windfall, Premier Baillieu has decided to take $616 million out of health care in Victoria.                  I share the member's concern about the hospitals in his electorate. The pressure on his hospitals from the Victorian government, from his Liberal colleagues, is inappropriate. I hope he rings Premier Baillieu and says, as a federal Liberal, 'Please, Premier Baillieu, do not cut health by $616 million.' I am sure he would want to say, as this government increases health funding to Victoria by $900 million, that hospitals in his electorate should -

  I thank the member for Moreton for his question and for his advocacy on behalf of the 19,000 small businesses in Moreton. The efforts of Australia's three million small business owners employ around 4.8 million Australians and contribute around 20 per cent of our economy. That is why this government has taken concrete action to support small business.                  We have lifted the tax-free threshold, which is a tax cut for every unincorporated business in Australia. Very importantly, the government has also increased the instant asset write-off threshold from $1,000 to $6,500, which will be worth more than $1 billion this year alone. This means increased and improved cash flow and less red tape for small business. We are also providing other tax relief. The government has introduced tax loss carry-back, which encourages innovation and productivity improvements and provides more certainty. The majority of the 110,000 businesses which will benefit from this are small businesses. These are some of the positive things the government has done - concrete action taken by the government on behalf of small business.                 The honourable member asked what the consequences of reversing these tax cuts would be. All honourable members would be concerned by the coalition's plan to reverse measures associated with the MRRT and with the carbon price. Reversing these tax cuts would be a blow to small business cash flow. Reversing these cuts would be a blow to steps to reduce the red-tape burden on small business. Any opposition which reverses these cuts is a false friend to small business. They can talk the talk about small business but they cannot walk the walk. This is an opposition in no position to lecture the government about small business.                  I am not the only one who thinks this - the Council of Small Business thinks it too. This is what they say about the opposition:                 We stated our concern last year that there are still people in the Liberal Party who believe that all small businesses vote for the coalition and therefore there is no need to do anything special for the small business community. We still have that concern and will continue to have dialogue with key coalition shadow ministers as we head towards an election in 2013. It is time that the whole of the coalition came to recognise that small businesses and independent contractors are in fact a mainstay of the economy and need fairness and transparency in policy and process.                 That is what COSBOA says about the Liberal Party, the once friend of small business. About the government, COSBOA says the 'level of interest and dialogue is welcomed and is recognition from the government that we count as citizens of Australia.' That is what the government believes.                      I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.

  To the Leader of the Opposition, the answer is: of course. I know the Leader of the Opposition is not interested in, or competent with, economics. And I know that the opposition is desperately trying to pretend that the Leader of the Opposition is interested in economic matters. But I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that, if he is engaging in this pretence, he should not come in and criticise the person; he should deal with the facts. The facts of the Australian economy are these: unlike economies around the world, we have low unemployment, low inflation and low interest rates; we are AAA-rated by all three major credit rating agencies; we have strong public finances; and, during the worst downturn in more than 80 years, during the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, we kept creating jobs. We kept creating jobs because this government, including the Treasurer, to whom the Leader of the Opposition refers, put jobs first.                 I understand that the Leader of the Opposition, if he had been in government, would have taken a different decision to Treasurer Wayne Swan. He would not have put the jobs of 200,000 Australians first; he would have consigned them to the unemployment queue. He would not now be getting our economy ready for the challenges of the future. He would not be embracing a clean energy future. He would not be embracing the digital economy. He would not be laying out a strategy for us to tap into the growth in our region, the Asian region. He would not be revolutionising this nation's approach to skills and to schools to ensure that we win the economic race by winning the education race. He would not be engaged in economic policies of that depth and complexity. I understand that.                 Because this government has focused on jobs, we have more than 800,000 Australians in jobs that have been created since this government came to office. Because we are investing now for the future, Australians can look forward to a future in which we will see strength, fairness and prosperity in our nation. We will see us harvest the benefits of being a smarter country. None of this future is assured. To get there, we have got to make the right choices. This government, including the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer, the member for Lilley, are making those right choices. If the Leader of the Opposition has an alternate plan then he should table it. He has had more than enough opportunity as Leader of the Opposition to do it, but I suspect we will never see it. Instead, we will continue to see this personal criticism.

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question. She is someone who knows first-hand about the challenges of balancing work and family life. She is doing a great job of balancing work and family life and representing her constituency of Greenway in this parliament. The member for Greenway, like all Labor members, knows that the purpose of our political party, formed more than 100 years ago, has been to provide fairness and decency to working people and, particularly, fairness and decency in workplaces. That is why, across the life of the Labor Party, we have fought for fairness and decency at work. There has been no more important or ferocious fight than the fight we engaged in against Work Choices. We fought the Liberal Party's Work Choices because it was unfair to every Australian worker. We fought the Liberal Party's Work Choices because it particularly hit women and young workers. Most particularly, when we look at the statistics for women, women on Work Choices AWAs were earning $87 less a week than women on collective agreements. This had been a stinging attack against the rights of working women. There were celebrated cases like the six mums who worked at a mushroom farm and were sacked after they refused to sign-up to Australian Workplace Agreements with a 25 per cent pay cut, and I understand those interjecting supported all of that.                   In contrast, we got rid of Work Choices because of that attack on Australian workers, particularly women. We understand that with the new Fair Work system it is important that we keep modernising because the needs of modern families change. The pressures to balance work and family life change over time. Having been the first government in this country to introduce a right to request flexible working conditions, we are intending to extend that right. We are intending to extend that right to workers who are returning from parental leave because, when you have just had a new child, having flexibility in your working conditions is one of the ways that will help you balance work and family life. We will also be extending that right to people who are caring for kids at school. We want to extend that right to people who are in all sorts of difficult circumstances including, particularly, women who may be dealing with domestic violence, are changing their family arrangements as a result and are in a particular time of strain for their family. This is an important change for Australian workers, and we will ensure that we deliver it as part of our Fair Work system, having got rid of Work Choices.

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for that question which goes to the purpose of the MRRT, but it also goes to the revenue forecasts. I wish to address the question of revenue forecasts immediately.                     Implicit in the Shadow Treasurer's question is that, somehow, Treasury forecasts can never change. The fact is that they do change frequently. In fact, we bring down a budget, bring down an update, and of course they are then matched against revenue heads as they come in monthly. There is nothing unusual about this. For example, when those opposite were in power, revenue was adjusted upwards by massive amounts - unexpected rivers of gold. Over $300 billion in something like three years. Those forecasts were adjusted. The truth is this: at the end of last year and through the second half of last year, there was a dramatic collapse in commodity prices. That collapse in commodity prices has impacted upon profits, and when profits go up resource rent taxes go up, and when profits come down resource rent taxes come down. Of course those opposite have always opposed a resource rent tax. Any amount of revenue from a resource rent tax is a direct affront to those opposite, who go down on bended knee to their mining billionaire friends. Let's be very clear that they do not support resource rent taxes. In fact, if the attitude that is being expressed over there were to have prevailed over the last 25 years, we would never have had a PRRT which has now raised $28 billion, but that resource rent tax was opposed by those opposite just as this resource rent tax is now being opposed by those opposite. The truth is that prices have come down dramatically; but, as the tax commissioner said in his note on Friday, a partial recovery of commodity prices has been reflected in a partial recovery in revenue.                 The fact is that this country needs a resource rent tax for our children and our grandchildren. Everyone on this side of the house is proud of the fact that we understand that the Australian people own our mineral resources 100 per cent and that we are all entitled to some of the super profits that flow from those. The attitude of those opposite is to get down on bended knee to the mining billionaires. So what we are seeing here is another misrepresentation and attack on good public policy to hide the fact that they have a vicious attack on the living standards of working Australians plan, by getting rid of the tripling of the tax free threshold, by knocking off the schoolkids bonus -

  I thank the member for Corangamite for his question, because he knows, as everyone on this side of the House knows, that Labor are always upfront about what we are going to do in workplace relations. On this side of the House, we believe in work-life-family balance. On this side of the House, we believe in cooperation between employees and employers. On this side of the House, we believe in flexible workplaces; we believe in productive workplaces. That is why I am pleased to advise the member for Corangamite that Labor will extend the National Employment Standards, which provide the right to request flexible work arrangements, to more Australian workers. The sorts of workers who are going to benefit from what we have just announced are carers, parents of school-age children, mature age workers, victims of domestic violence and those who seek to help them.                 We also announced yesterday that we intend to provide better roster protection for people who experience sudden changes to their rosters which upset family arrangements, which cause great harm at home. The reason why we are doing these things is that Labor understands that we live in a changing world. We know that the Menzies-DLP vision - of Dad going to work nine to five, of a pipe at home, of Mum not working - does not describe most modern families anymore. We understand that the world has changed, unlike the policy of those opposite. We know that women are participating in the workforce more than ever. We know that fathers want to spend more time with their families. We know that people with disabilities and carers want into the workforce. We understand that families come in all shapes and sizes. This is a positive view of encouraging people to participate and creating good jobs in the future.                 But the problem is that there is only one side of Australian politics that wants to be positive about workplace relations. Whenever we talk about workplace relations, someone in the central bunker of Liberal headquarters presses the alarm button and says: 'Quick; we'd better get out and bash unions. We'd better disguise the fact that we do not have a policy for Australian workplaces.' Even better, someone in Liberal Party headquarters presses the button and says: 'Quick, let's rake over something from 20 years ago as a revenge against our Prime Minister.' At least we talk about workplace relations. I will tell you about Liberal flexibility - because they will not. Under Liberals, it is more flexible to sack someone. It is more flexible to cut their pay. It is more flexible, but they do not have job security. Under Labor, our definition of flexibility is productivity; it is modern families getting a decent go in the workplace. I love it when the Leader of the Opposition reminds everyone, as he did today, that he is the worker's best friend. With friends like him, you don't need enemies!

  Yes, I am. I am absolutely aware of it. The member ought to be aware that it takes months for spot prices to flow through to MRRT revenues. It is not the case that you have a spot price on one day and it is reflected in the MRRT revenues the next, as the member has sought to imply. That is just factually incorrect and yet another example of the extent to which all those opposite will go to misrepresent the basic facts, not just of revenue in the case of the MRRT but the basic facts about our economy.                 One of the reasons we are seeing so much bitterness, so  much aggression, from those opposite about these questions of modelling, about these questions of forecasts and about these questions of revenue is that they are still smarting from the fact that two years ago they were sprung - they were sprung by our forecasters; they were sprung by our advisers - with an $11 billion hole in their election package which they had deliberately tried to hide from the Australian people right through the whole election campaign. That is why we have seen in this House, and particularly from the shadow Treasurer, a constant campaign against the advisers. They are carrying on as if somehow all these forecasts have been done by the government - nothing to do with our advisers, nothing to do with the fact that we are advised by the same professional public servants that they were advised by.                 The truth is that we have been through one of the most volatile periods in the Australian economy and in the global economy in over 80 years. For political purposes those opposite seek to deny that. They seek to deny the global financial crisis. They seek to deny that there was an $11 billion hole in their election costings - the biggest bungle in Australian political history when it comes to election costings. That is why they are so embarrassed, and that is why they are conducting these sorts of campaigns about the forecasts which are provided in a responsible way to this government. It is also why they are so embarrassed about the fact that this government has been prepared to make the big calls on the economy.                     Everyone on this side of the House is proud that we have made the big calls on the economy, and we have got them right. On that side of the House you have got them comprehensively wrong. If you had had your way during the global financial crisis, unemployment would have been through the roof and we would not be talking about solid growth and job creation in the Australian economy. All of that behaviour from those opposite is about camouflaging -

  I thank the member for Dobell for his question. I have met with him and the former mayor, Bob Graham, about the proposal for an airport to service the regions of the Central Coast and the Lower Hunter. The joint study conducted with the New South Wales government found that there would be over a million people living in the Central Coast and the Lower Hunter regions over the next 25 years. As a result of that population growth, as a stimulus to the local economy supporting jobs, increased aviation capacity would be required. That is why the government have agreed to examine strategy including the Wallara site, which is in Wyong in the member's electorate. It would be a small airport due to the size of the land that would be available, according to the council, but would be able to service that region. Of course, the member would be aware that this would not alleviate the need for a second airport for Sydney in order to secure jobs, ensure economic growth and ensure Sydney's position as a global city. As part of the study that is being undertaken, we are investigating whether RAAF Base Richmond could fulfil some capacity as an interim measure with limited civilian operations.                 What we are seeing is enormous growth in aviation - 64 million passengers 10 years ago has grown to 111 million passengers during the last full financial year. What that doubling means is that there will be an increased demand for aviation as a result of aviation's critical role as a driver of national economic growth, as a driver of jobs and as a driver of Australia's position in a global economy. Because Sydney has four out of every 10 movements, the capacity's constraints at KSA are a handbrake on the national economy. I note the comments of the shadow minister, and I welcome his comments acknowledging that there is a need for bipartisanship on this issue and that there is a need for this issue to be dealt with. It has been a political football for a long time, but we do need to deal with this issue. There is substantial support amongst many communities for the jobs and economic growth that aviation activity brings, and I look forward to working with the members on the Central Coast about these issues into the future.

  I thank the member for Deakin for that question, because the government put jobs and growth at the heart of our agenda every single day. In fact, that is what we did during the global financial crisis to ensure that Australia avoided the full force of the global financial crisis and the global recession. By doing that we avoided the permanent skills destruction that has caused so much damage to people and communities right across the developed world. Here we have got low unemployment and we have created over 850,000 jobs. Of course, if you looked at what has happened across other developed economies, there is massive unemployment and millions and millions of people out of work. As we have been handling those situations in the global economy, we have been concentrating on an agenda to lift productivity, to create the high-skilled, high-waged jobs of the future. That is what our investment in infrastructure has been all about. It is what the NBN is about. It is what our investment in innovation is all about. It is about reforms to the tax system, most particularly it is about tripling the tax free threshold.                 All of that has produced a situation where our economy is now 13 per cent larger than it was prior to the global financial crisis with 850,000 jobs created over that period. Our concern is to use this prosperity so we can support working Australian families, modern Australian families that need access to affordable health and education, modern Australian families that want dignity in their retirement That is why we have put in place one of the most significant increases in the age pension, and it is, indeed, why we are so committed to compulsory superannuation. It is why we have tripled the tax-free threshold which is so important for work incentives and for cost-of-living relief for many people on the lowest incomes. That is why we have been committed to the Schoolkids Bonus for 1.3 million families, so we can assist them with the cost of sending their kids to school. Of course, there is a real contrast here with the actions of those opposite. They want to rip away up to $500 from the superannuation accounts of 3.6 million Australians.                 Of course, they have opposed the increase in the superannuation guarantee, which goes to all working Australians. And Joe can tweet what he likes; he came into this House and opposed the increase in the superannuation guarantee. And of course we know they want to rip out the tripling of the tax free threshold: another savage attack on those on low incomes and low wages. We know that when it comes to working Australians, the opposition will always bow down to the feet of the fortunate few.                 Now, I heard that the Leader of the Opposition this morning claimed that he was a friend of the workers. Well, God help the workers if he is a friend of theirs! The opposition are the architects of Work Choice; the architects of this savage attack coming right now against low-income Australians.

  You could tell how embarrassed the member was with that ridiculous question.                    The member for Casey then left the chamber.                     I was saying before, that the attitude that has been taken today is similar to the attitude that their predecessors took with the PRRT. The PRRT was opposed, tooth and nail, by vested interests and by the Liberal Party but it has raised $28 billion.                     They kept it. They did not come into government and say, 'We'll get rid of it.' So, what we have seen again is that they are opposing the MRRT - the MRRT, which is an important long-term reform for Australia, to make sure that Australians get a fair share of the mineral wealth they own 100 per cent.                  It just so happens that its introduction has coincided with a bout of global volatility towards the end of last year which had a dramatic impact on commodity prices - a very dramatic impact on commodity prices. This was not an impact on commodity prices that was forecast by anyone in the private sector, by any of the companies, and it most certainly was not forecast by our official forecasters. But the opposition should at least acknowledge that it has had a dramatic impact on revenue. And that is what the government has acknowledged.                 But what the opposition will also not acknowledge is that in the second half of last year it was not just the PRRT and the MRRT; it was company tax, capital gains tax and so on. All of them took a very significant hit from this global volatility. The reason this is so important, and the reason this debate demonstrates just how dangerous those opposite would be if they were running the country, is this: what they are saying is that to make up this 'revenue hole', if you like, that has emerged because of all of these circumstances, they would take the axe to the social safety net and put a sledge hammer through our economy. That is how reckless they are.                 And, of course, we heard in the House last week of the retrospective approach they would have taken during the global financial crisis, when they came in here and effectively said that during the crisis they would have cut to the tune of $160 billion, which was the revenue write-down. Well, where would the Australian economy be today if they had been in charge and done that?                 So what all this demonstrates is just how dangerous they are, because they are in denial of the most basic facts that go to the core of Australia's prosperity and economic success over the past five years: the ability of a government to move in and protect people and protect families, understanding the volatility in a global economy. Lives depend on that but those opposite are a dangerous alternative because they do not understand the basic facts of our economy -

  I thank the member for Moreton very much for his question. I certainly know he understands, in his own family life, what so many other families face: the daily juggle of getting their kids up and ready for school as mum and dad get ready for work, dropping them off at school and at childcare.                 This government also understands those challenges, and that is why we have been determined to support families as they make their choices every single day. That is why it was left to this government to deliver Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme - a national paid parental leave scheme that has now delivered to 260,000 families in this country. And in the electorate of Moreton in Brisbane around 1,600 families have benefited different from our paid parental leave scheme, making sure that families get the choice to stay at home with their newborn babies and get that extra financial support with their bills.                 Of course, it was this government that delivered dad and partner pay, just six weeks ago. Six weeks ago we delivered dad and partner pay so that dads, too, can have some time off work to spend that precious couple of weeks at the start of their babies' lives and also get some financial support with their bills.                 Since 1 January this year we have seen around 6,000 dads apply for dad and partner pay. So, 6,000 dads are getting the help that they need to spend time at home with their newborn babies. We know that as children grow, families need that flexibility of work, and we have heard from the Prime Minister today about how this Labor government will make sure that as children grow and as parents juggle their work and family responsibilities, we make sure that families have as much flexibility as possible to juggle those responsibilities.                 What we also know is that those opposite do not support the choices that families are making. It is this government that has delivered the schoolkids bonus, and those opposite, of course, do not trust the choices that families are making. They want to take the schoolkids bonus back because they do not trust how families are spending the money. It was this Leader of the Opposition who said, when he was a minister, that he would see paid parental leave introduced over his dead body. No wonder parents do not trust anything he says. Now he says that he has the idea of paying wealthy women $75,000 to have the baby - parents do not trust anything he says.

  First of all, I want to make the point that all of the policies are fully costed in our budget and fully reflected in our budget bottom line. I know that those opposite find that highly embarrassing because we are delivering for Australia - across the regions of this country - some of the most important projects that Australians have been waiting for for a long time. For example, in Perth, the Gateway project is being delivered. I think that those opposite might want to just take a bit of a breath here, because what we have been doing is putting in place some fundamental investments across  our economy. I know they are highly embarrassed by the fact that they opposed the instant asset write-off which has been a massive boon for small business in our community. In fact, that is the policy that they are going to take to the next election - to get rid of it. They want to get rid of that for hundreds of thousands of small businesses. I know they are highly embarrassed by that as well.                 I would just be a bit careful, when you are seeking to make your political points, about what you are committing yourself to: a major attack on small business and a major attack on superannuation. It is on something like eight million Australians with superannuation. That is what you are committing yourself to, in addition to getting rid of the tripling of the tax-free threshold.                 You can see that the realisation is starting to dawn on a couple of the faces over there about what a sledgehammer those opposite are planning for the Australian economy -                      small businesses and the Australian workforce.

  I thank the member for Wakefield, my colleague from South Australia, for his question. Late in his prime ministership, John Howard bowed to the bleeding obvious and declared the work-life balance issues of Australia to be a 'barbecue stopper'. He was right. The trouble was, of course, that he then did precious little of substance -                      to help Australian barbecues run more smoothly: no paid parental leave, no real attention to childcare policy and certainly no thought to the industrial issues involved, unless you count Work Choices. By contrast, this government has acted where the last government just talked. We intend to keep building on those achievements.                 While the public and the media debate has tended to focus on the needs of Australian families with young children in this regard, we also know that a good work-life balance is an increasing challenge for older Australians. Australians over 55 are bearing greater caring responsibilities than ever before, often for their ageing parents as well as for their own children or sometimes grandchildren. This is happening at a time when Australia is relying more and more on increased workforce participation by this same group.                 Indeed, around a quarter of the total growth in Australia's workforce last decade was by an increase in the number of Australians working into their sixties. While the total workforce grew over that period by about 25 per cent, the number of men in their sixties working grew by 110 per cent and the number of women working in their sixties grew by an astounding 200 per cent. But older workers often do not want to continue the work arrangements they had when they were younger. They want to have more flexibility in their work to take advantage of healthy early retirement or semi-retirement years and, obviously, they want flexibility to deal with their growing caring responsibilities.                 Indeed, the ABS tells us that there are as many as one million older workers who want to move from full-time work to part-time work before they retire. Giving those Australians the flexibility and the right to formally request flexible work arrangements from their employer is not just the just the proper thing to do for a cohort that has worked so hard and for so long; it is also now an economic imperative. Extending the right to request flexible work arrangements to Australians over 55 was a direct recommendation of the government's Advisory Panel on the Economic Potential of Senior Australians. It is the right decision and it is a decision that deserves the support of the entire parliament.

  First and foremost, the member raises the issue of the budget. We spent some time in question time last week, and indeed today, on issues associated with the budget and the inability of the opposition to recognise that there was a global financial crisis - the biggest economic disturbance since the great depression - and that this of course had implications for the global economy, put millions of people out of work around the world and has had implications, too, for the budget, writing down revenues by $160 billion.                     Well, the question referred to budget surplus, and I am addressing that.                     Thank you very much, Speaker, and I am addressing the question as it was initially asked. The member absolutely and specifically referred to a budget surplus. I am dealing with questions associated with the budget. If he has misdrafted his question that is a matter for him. I am making the point that if the member is genuinely interested in matters associated with the budget then he would of course, unlike those who proffer economic commentary on behalf of the opposition, have to recognise that we have lived through the biggest global economic event since the Great Depression, that around the world tens of millions of people have been thrown out of work, and that whilst we have come through that with low inflation and low unemployment, strong public finances, strong economic growth and a strong AAA rating, it has had implications for our budget, particularly a $160 billion write-off of revenue. As a result, the government is making decisions that continue to prioritise jobs and growth, because we believe that is important, and we will always put the jobs of working Australians first.                 The member, as well as asking very generally about the budget, also specifically referred to budget matters and to asylum seekers and arrivals. I would remind the member that if he wants to look at these questions then it would pay to deal with the facts. I remind him that the government has returned about 1,000 people to -                      The government has returned about 1,000 people to Sri Lanka since 13 August. That is many more than the Howard government ever did in as short a period of time. This is part of the way in which the government is addressing asylum seeker issues. Consequently the member, rather than waving around pieces of paper, may want to deal credibly with the facts in this debate.

  I thank the member for Parramatta. In her electorate over $100 million has seen improvements or upgrading of 32 classrooms, 16 libraries, 17 multipurpose halls and so it goes from the investment that this Labor government makes in education, because we know that it is the single most important investment we can make in the nation's future. And we know that by properly investing in education we enable children to reach their full potential, get highly paid jobs in the future and of course contribute to productivity. That is why, after inheriting a system that had suffered from a decade of neglect by the coalition when in government, we worked with states and territories to provide more information to parents through the MySchool website to lift the quality of teaching, to improve literacy and numeracy results through national partnerships and smarter schools, to improve facilities in schools right across the nation and to bring a national curriculum in, set at the very highest levels, to give our kids the best chance that we can.                 Every time I visit a school I see this proud investment in place. But the fact is, there is more to do. The Gonski review found that the model for funding our schools was broken, and it found that too many Australian kids are getting left behind. That is why we have developed a national plan for school improvement to deliver extra funding for schools that need it, based on the needs of every student in every single school, delivering the reforms that we know will lift results: improved teacher training, better teaching, more local decision making, more teachers aid, special equipment - those things that are needed now in the classroom to make a difference to the kids' education for the future. We will pay our fair share, and we expect the states to do likewise. We have a plan to put Australia in the top five nations in the world by 2025, and that means Australian parents can be confident that their kids can get those highly paid, high-performing jobs of the future.                 I am asked by the member about the impact of doing nothing on school funding. The fact is that if we do not act on school funding - and certainly that is the position that the opposition has taken - then not only will education performance around Australia continue to struggle but Australian students will get fewer resources for their education in the future. To be clear: if we stick to the broken funding model that we now have, then Australian schools are likely to be worse off to the tune of around $5 billion. So it is very disappointing for Australian parents to see the Leader of the Opposition cutting the schoolkids bonus and even more disappointing to see the shadow minister declare that a plan to make Australia a stronger, smarter and much more intelligent country is mad. We will deliver a national plan -

  First, I am not going to speculate about an early, incomplete departmental working document that has been neither presented to government nor circulated to other relevant agencies but has apparently been leaked to the media. It goes without saying that the Defence white paper will be released, as the government has announced. The member, when it is released, may want to study that white paper.                 On the question of the Defence budget, can I be very clear with the House and with the member who has asked the question. We were the first government to budget over $100 billion for Defence, and again this year we have budgeted $103 billion across the forward estimates. That is part of making the right decisions for national security. A little bit earlier this year I had the opportunity to outline the first ever National Security Strategy for the nation, and I refer the member to that.                 I also refer the member to the fact that the opposition in the area of Defence has made a series of completely inconsistent statements about whether or not the opposition would add to Defence spending or would not add to Defence spending. We have had different statements from different spokespeople on different days. The Leader of the Opposition has said different things at different times. That kind of incompetence cannot be allowed to prevail. The opposition now has the opportunity to be crystal clear about its statements on Defence and crystal clear about budgeting for Defence and matching savings should they determine to make extra expenditure. I indicate, for example, that they have made commitments about indexation of military superannuation that have not been properly accounted for -                      The government will outline the Defence white paper. The government's budget for Defence is as I have outlined it. If the opposition wants to be taken seriously on this question it needs to be crystal clear about its policy statements, about costings and about matching savings. Given the completely contradictory statements made to date, no-one, at this point, can take the opposition seriously on Defence.                 Leave not granted.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. Since 2007, Labor has delivered stronger health services and our plans for the future are very clear: more doctors, more nurses, more allied health professionals, more beds, less waiting, building and rebuilding of our hospitals and GP services, expanded primary care, cheaper medicines, dental care, cancer prevention and services.                 When I heard that Real Solutions was coming out, I thought that I had better set some time aside to read the health section but, as it happens, I did not need very much time at all. There is not much planning there - a one-page list of slogans. You only need to look at the states to be able to read the tea leaves.                     In Queensland: cuts of $1.6 billion. In Victoria: $616 million cut. We are investing in reducing waiting times for hospital patients with projects like the $15 million to expand the surgery centre at the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital in Victoria that was opened earlier this month. Part of more than $1 billion in capital and facilitation money was set to reduce emergency department and elective surgery waiting times. However, we see that despite this new investment waiting times in states like Victoria have been going backwards for a year - longer waiting times in emergency and longer lists for elective surgery.                  We are putting primary care in the hands of local communities through Medicare Locals. The shadow minister said he wants to slash thousands of jobs from Medicare Locals: doctors, nurses and allied health professionals. We have seen the rebuilding that is on top of the cuts in Queensland - 4,000 health workers were cut by Campbell Newman. We are building and rebuilding hospitals and GP clinics. Just this morning, I turned the first sod on the new Canberra GP super clinic and, more recently, I was in Gosford, with the member for Robertson, looking at her beautiful new site for a GP super clinic up there.                 In dental care, $5 billion will be invested in dental care over coming years, with $2.7 billion so that 3.4 million kids can see a dentist as easily as they now see a GP and almost $2 billion extra invested into public dental that is already taking people off waiting lists in the ACT, Tasmania, South Australia and very soon in New South Wales.                  Real Solutions has a lot of aspirations. It has a lot of slogans, but not much detail there. In fact, I have seen more detail in a fortune cookie in the last week.

  Hope springs eternal. After 1,099 days I have finally got a question on policy from the opposition! On the weekend, I celebrated three years since I last had a question from the opposition. Therefore, I welcome this question with open arms. I welcome the fact that the Gillard Labor government has developed a sophisticated plan to engage Australia in the opportunities presented by the Asian century. We will have by 2030 three billion middle-class customers in Asia as we diversify our economy. We will continue to sell gas and minerals.                     Dr EMERSON:                     This engagement will mean that we will diversify our economy into services and back into agriculture and into sophisticated manufactured goods as we take advantage of regional supply chains. The Australian economy is the envy of the world. When it comes to the budget position of the Australian economy, we are achieving the most rapid fiscal consolidation in Australia's history. We do not and will not accept the economy or budget policy prescriptions of the Leader of the Opposition. And this could not be more relevant.                     Dr EMERSON:                     The Leader of the Opposition wonders why we are not going down the New Zealand path, which was a path to recession. At all times, the Labor government will put jobs first.                     Dr EMERSON:                     The question is about budget policy and surpluses. I have indicated that this government is achieving the most rapid fiscal consolidation in Australia's history. I could not be more relevant.                     Dr EMERSON:                     On the specific issue of budget policy, we are achieving this rapid fiscal consolidation and we are doing it ahead of every major advanced country on earth. We will always put jobs first. We will not go down the coalition pathway of recession, which the opposition leader recommended. He said that he did not know what was wrong with going down the New Zealand path, which -                      Dr EMERSON:                     was a path to recession. On budget policy and on surpluses, we will always put the interests of the working men and women of Australia first. We have done that before and we will do it again because this is a Labor government that believes in the working men and women of this country and not the reckless and highly irresponsible policies that the coalition has always invoked.

  I thank the member for Blair for his question. He has been very active in relation to this issue in particular. Members of the House will recall the prophecies of doom and gloom made by the coalition in relation to carbon pricing and how it would operate in the meat processing sector. Guess what? The doom and gloom has not transpired. Senator Joyce claimed that a leg of lamb would cost $100. We had another claim by the coalition that for each head of cattle admitted to an abattoir it would cost $575,000. And it was all garbage; it was all rubbish. All the rubbish that the other side went on with about this issue was totally deceitful and misleading.                 The reality is that the government has worked very closely with the meat industry in applying the carbon price within the industry. It is leading to new investment in new technologies that will cut electricity consumption, reduce emissions intensity, cut greenhouse gas emissions and improve productivity and competitiveness. In making those commitments, the industry has worked with the government. Various grants are being provided to various abattoirs to support the investments being made.                 For example, in January this year I and the member for Blair announced a $4.4 million grant to JBS Australia for its Dinmore abattoir facility and meat processing plant. The result is that JBS will slash its electricity costs by $1.1 million a year by covering its settlement ponds, capturing the methane and generating electricity for its site. The emissions intensity of that particular facility at Dinmore - that is, the amount of pollution produced per kilo of beef - will be reduced by 81 per cent. The payback period for the company's investment is only two years; it will start to get a return on this investment in two years. A very similar project is being undertaken by AJ Bush and Sons at its Bromelton meat processing plant. The government has provided a $6.1 million grant. That investment will cut the energy costs at Bromelton by 46 per cent per year and reduce the emissions intensity of the plant by 64 per cent. These are quite extraordinary productivity and environmental outcomes achieved through the application of the carbon price in the meat processing industry.                 Guess what else? These things will all be abolished by the other side. The cow cockies will be down here arguing for these to be kept. The position that the opposition has is so ridiculous, so environmentally absurd and so economically irresponsible that they will be under pressure from people on their own side of politics to keep the carbon price in place. The so-called pledge to get rid of it is simply not credible.

  To answer the Leader of the Opposition's question, I was quoting some of the conclusions of the Policy Transition Group, which was overseen by Don Argus, a very respected Australian and certainly a very respected figure in the resources industry. I think it is perhaps inappropriate for members of the opposition to be jeering a name like Don Argus in this parliament. Don Argus led a policy transition group which brought together representatives of industry and others to work through a series of implementation matters associated with the minerals resource rent tax. Yesterday in the parliament I referred to their conclusions and I referred to a process, which has been ongoing since, involving the Commonwealth Head of Treasury in discussions with state counterparts about the ongoing treatment of state royalties.

  I thank the member for Banks for his question and I thank him for his interest in the Australian economy and the opportunities of people in his electorate to get work. The member for Banks knows, as all members of the government know, that it is impossible to understand our modern world and it is impossible to shape plans for the future unless you clearly understand the impact of the global financial crisis, its causes, its magnitude, its effects and its aftershocks. No-one can credibly present as a commentator or a policy maker in economic affairs unless they understand at a level of depth the impacts of the global financial crisis.                 To give people just one statistic which helps understand the magnitude of the global financial crisis and its after-effects: the eurozone is still in recession and in the United States over 12 million people are unemployed. That is the size of the Australian labour market in total - that many people unemployed. That is the size of the effects, ongoing, of the global financial crisis and its implications for the real economy around the world. When you have lived through an economic event of that magnitude then you need to fully understand its aftereffects.                 Here in this country, because we acted decisively, we supported Australian jobs and kept Australians working. I am proud that, during the worst of the global financial crisis, we stepped forward and supported 200,000 jobs and I am proud that, as a government, since our election we have overseen the creation of more than 800,000 jobs. But the global financial crisis has ongoing implications, including reducing government revenues by $160 billion. And, of course, this comes at a time where our economy is still being shaped and reshaped by the strong Australian dollar and its ongoing impacts. That means it would be precisely the wrong time to seek offsetting savings to future revenue downgrades. It would be precisely the wrong time to go through the government's budget with swinging cutbacks to jobs, precisely the wrong time to do that.                 This government will do what is necessary during this period of economic change defined by the global financial crisis and, ongoing, by the strength of the Australian dollar and the growth in our region. We will do everything in this period, as we have in the past, to support jobs and growth so that working Australians get an opportunity to build a decent life for themselves and their families.

  Once again the Leader of the Opposition shows he is months and months and months and months behind the economic debate in this country. It is truly astonishing that he would walk into this parliament today and pretend that discussions between the head of the federal Treasury and state counterparts about treatment of royalties is somehow new or only newly reported today or newly announced yesterday. This is all absurd - completely absurd. The Leader of the Opposition, as we know, is not interested in economic matters, and you could not get a better demonstration of it -                      Thank you very much, Speaker. I was just trying to catch the Leader of the Opposition up on months and months and months and months of economic dialogue that he has clearly missed out on, so let's just start at the beginning. I, working with the Deputy Prime Minister and the minister for resources, entered an agreement with the mining industry. We then had a policy transition group overseen by Don Argus. We then brought the legislation to the parliament. The legislation passed. We implemented the tax. There was a question about unsustainable royalty increases by state governments. We made that part of what we asked the GST review to look at. And of course there are people involved in the GST review who have got a connection to the other side of politics - I am obviously thinking here of Nick Greiner - and they have produced a report. Following the production of that report, it has been clear publicly that federal Treasury has been in dialogue with the heads of state treasuries. There is nothing new about that. Anybody who had picked up the Financial Review or the Australian newspaper on more days than today would have been able to tell you that complete story months and months ago. So the Leader of the Opposition once again, through the form of his question and his carry-on in this parliament, just shows how deeply uncomfortable he is and how deeply ignorant he is of economic matters.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for that question. If there is one thing that is clear from the experience of the global economy over the past five years, it is that we have got to put jobs and growth first. Sadly, in Europe they are living with the consequences of not doing that. It has not happened to the extent it should have happened in the United States, either. But here we have put jobs and growth first. The consequence of that has been the creation of 850,000 jobs during our time in power. As a consequence, our economy is resilient. As a consequence, our public finances are stronger - because here we have put jobs and growth first. So we have got to build on this resilience for the next five years to make sure we continue to deliver the jobs and the growth that propels those jobs. We have got to do that.                 Also, we have got to provide support, particularly support for Australians in their retirement. Of course I am very pleased to say that the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs today has announced a reduction in the deeming rate, which will provide some additional modest assistance to pensioners. This builds on our historic increase in the pension, the biggest increase in a century. It also builds on our commitment to dignity in retirement and on our commitment to superannuation, in particular to raise the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent. But also we make that additional contribution to the superannuation of low-income workers, a significant boost to their superannuation.                 So it is absolutely mind-boggling that those opposite could announce that they are simply going to rip that out, rip away that support for 3.6 million Australians on the lowest incomes. Why are they doing this? There is one simple reason. We know why, because the shadow Treasurer said it on breakfast television sitting there beside the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. They have got a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line. What we know is that they have got working people in the firing line. Working people are in the firing line because they have bungled their budget bottom line. So they are absolutely intent on not producing any costings before the next election, because they know if they do they will be sprung again, like they were last time. In the past five years they have only had to front up once with costed policies. They came after the election. When they were examined by the Treasury and the department of finance, what did we find? An $11 billion crater, the biggest costing bungle in Australian political history. What they are hoping to do is escape through and hide the savage cuts that they have got directed towards working Australians.

  To the member's question, first, the government has no plans to change the design of the MRRT. Second, there is an ongoing process which is well known - and the shadow Treasurer, if he had chosen to inform himself about it, would have known it for some time now - which is that we referred to the GST distribution review issues associated with the interaction of state royalties and the MRRT. They made a set of recommendations and the Treasurer has discussed that. The Standing Council on Federal Financial Relations agreed that the heads of Treasury would investigate a cooperative approach to resolving the issues regarding interaction of state royalties and the MRRT.                 So to the shadow Treasurer, who is following the Leader of the Opposition into an inability to keep up with the contemporary economic debate, that meeting between the Treasurer and his counterparts was in December, and the process of -                      I was asked by the shadow Treasurer about the MRRT. I am answering that question. I am directing him to the publicly available information about the GST distribution review and the publicly available information about how -                      There is no amount of yelling at me that changes these facts. This is the publicly available information from December last year about the Standing Council on Federal Financial Relations and the publicly available information from since that time, when there have been discussions in train between federal Treasury and the heads of other treasuries around the country.                 The member who asked the question does really need to catch up with that.                 MRRT is an important long-term reform, and like all long-term reforms it is there to make a difference not only for today's generation but for generations into the future. Behind all of the shadow Treasurer's bluster lies one simple proposition: do you think Australians should get a fair share of the mineral wealth within their grounds, yes or no? No amount of yelling gets you away from answering that basic values proposition. We say 'Yes'; the opposition says 'No'.

  I reject the proposition which has been put by the member for Melbourne because, as I was saying before, this government is all about jobs and getting people who are not in work back into work, which is why something like 850,000 jobs have been created over the past five years. We have put in place some reforms in this area to increase work incentives. We have done that because we are all about jobs and making sure that people have the capacity to move off payments and into paid work. That is why we put in place more generous taper rates for single parents on Newstart.                 But it is not just that: it is what we have done by tripling the tax-free threshold for the lowest paid workers in our community - a very substantial benefit to low-paid workers, something that is going to be ripped out by the Leader of the Opposition. He referred to this today. He is going to rip out that tax cut for low-paid workers in the Australian community. But it is much more than that. We are also paying the schoolkids bonus, a very significant increase in the disposable income of a lot of people in our community on the lowest incomes.                 We have also dramatically increased the childcare tax rebate and so on, and also support for child care. I think we have a very good record of support for people on the lowest incomes, consistent with our belief that we need to get people into the labour market so that they can get the training to provide for their family. I think that is very important.                 I was also asked about royalties. The Prime Minister has made the point very clear that we are also now in discussions with the states about this very point, which was also discussed in the Argus report, where concern was expressed about international competitiveness in terms of our mining levels of taxation. All of these things are going on right now.                 There is one fundamental difference in this House and there is something that we do share in common. We both believe - we both believe - that these resources are owned 100 per cent by the Australian people, and when super profits are made super profits tax should be paid. That is a very big divide in this House between all of us over here and those on the other side of the House. They do not believe that one dollar of MRRT revenue is legitimate - not one dollar is legitimate in their belief! - so desperate are they to bend their knees to the mining billionaires. They do not believe, and will not accept, one dollar! But, of course, this is consistent with their approach, because they opposed the PRRT, another resource rent tax, which has now raised $28 billion. The point is this: prices have been volatile and we have been through a difficult period, but what we are all committed to on this side of the House is fair resource taxation for the benefit for all Australians.

  I thank the member for Reid for his question. This government is determined to reward the effort of hard-working Australian families and to build a stronger economy for the future. That is why we have delivered tax cuts and increases in superannuation for hard-working Australians. That is why we have provided tax relief to small businesses. Now as we seek to meet the challenges of the Asian century we are investing in skills and education, and rolling out the National Broadband Network.                 These are serious plans to tackle the serious challenges that our nation faces. In contrast, those opposite are hiding from any scrutiny. We put our proposals and our plans before the Australian people and they will be scrutinised. The Leader of the Opposition is such a policy lightweight and so determined to hide from any scrutiny that he will not even turn up and front up on breakfast television any more. I am not surprised that he will not turn up on breakfast television anymore because it was on breakfast television that the member for North Sydney confirmed not once, but on two occasions that they have a $70 billion black hole. It is about time the member for North Sydney told the Australian people how he intends to fill that $70 billion black hole.                 We heard from the member for North Sydney two years ago. Two years ago he said their policies would be ready in a week. Last year he said their policies were ready to go, fully costed. Two weeks ago we heard from the Leader of the Opposition that, 'You'll hear all about our policies after the budget'. Every time they make a commitment to release their policies, when it comes to the crunch they squib it. And we saw this again yesterday from the member for North Sydney, who put out a press release selectively quoting officials from the Parliamentary Budget Office and where he used the words that they had to offer to try and justify the fact that he wants to keep secret from the Australian people his costings until the final days of the election campaign. It is no wonder, after the $11 billion black hole fiasco of the last election.                 The member for North Sydney was out at the doors this morning trying to airbrush that out of history. A journalist asked him, 'Your costings were wrong before the last election?' He said: 'I don't accept that. I don't accept that at all.' '$11 billion out', the journalist says. And the member for North Sydney says, 'I don't accept that - not at all.' He does not accept it. So shonky were his costings that the so-called auditors of their costings were reprimanded for professional misconduct.                     You say your policies are ready. Stop making excuses and come -

  When it rains it pours! - 1,099 days with no questions and then a deluge of questions: two in two days. To the leader of the government in the House I express my sorrow that the member for  Wide Bay did not direct a question to the leader of the government in the House but I am very glad to receive this question.                 The MRRT is a tax that is designed to collect for the community a fair share of the profits when profits are high, very much like the petroleum resource rent tax, which the coalition condemned, which it criticised and which it kept. It kept at least $18 billion of revenue. In respect of the MRRT and its design, what I have said is what the Prime Minister has said and what the Treasurer has said -                      Dr EMERSON:                     and that is that in respect of royalties there is an existing process which is well known to every member of the parliament who can read.                     Dr EMERSON:                     We know that there is one member of the parliament who does not read documents, and that is the Leader of the Opposition. He does not read BHP statements; he does not read Ashby verdicts. He does not read documents, but now it is infecting the front bench -                      Dr EMERSON:                     because we have the shadow Treasurer and also, now, the Leader of the Nationals not reading the fact that for three months or more there has been a process in train in relation to the treatment of royalties. And that process follows on the Don Argus review and the GST distribution processes. That is a well-known fact to everyone in this House - everyone in this chamber - except the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and, now, the Leader of the Nationals, the would-be Deputy Prime Minister of this country. I say to all of them that what they should do is take the time and read the documents. If you want to be an alternative government -                      Dr EMERSON:                     you need to know that the MRRT is a tax designed to collect for the community a fair share of the revenue. We will always do the right thing. We will increase superannuation from nine to 12 per cent and the shadow Treasurer said, on Friday, that they would not. They would scrap it.                     Dr EMERSON:                     There he is again.                     Dr EMERSON:                     It is, absolutely, because you condemned Channel 9 for lying. You condemned Channel 9 for lying.                     Dr EMERSON:                     You have reaffirmed that the coalition will scrap the increase in the super tax from nine to 12 per cent. Thank you very much indeed.                     Dr EMERSON:                     I seek to table a document, which is that of the shadow Treasurer tweeting at 7.09 pm on Friday evening saying that Channel 9 got it wrong and that he had never said -                      Dr EMERSON:                     that they would scrap the increase in super from nine to 12 per cent.                   The members for Moncrieff and Gr                   e                   y then left the chamber.

  I thank the member for Kingston for her question and do not believe it should be referred to in dismissive terms by the opposition, given how widespread is community concern about bullying in workplaces.                 The member for Kingston has a very direct interest in this policy area because she led a parliamentary committee that inquired into workplace bullying. I want to commend her on that effort and that work, and commend the committee members who worked with her. It is a fine example of what can be achieved by parliamentarians on very difficult questions of community concern.                 Everyone has a right to go to work each day and to be treated with dignity and respect. Everyone has a right to return home at the end of their working day or working shift safe and well. We want to make sure that Australians are able to participate in workplaces that are safe, healthy and productive. But unfortunately there are too many instances of bullying at work. There are too many times in particular that young people are bullied at work - young apprentices, young people in their first job. Of course workplace bullying is not confined to young people, but some of the most disturbing cases have involved young Australians. Right around the country many members in this parliament would have met with people who have had particular concerns about work and working conditions or the working conditions of their young sons or daughters.                 I would like to pay tribute to two fine Australians, Damien and Rae Panlock, the parents of Brodie Panlock. Brodie was subject to absolutely relentless bullying at work and Brodie is no longer with us as a result. Brodie took her own life - an incredibly tragic incident in Victoria and the subject of a great deal of public commentary in Victoria. They, Brodie's parents, Damien and Rae, are brave people and they have campaigned for change.                 I am proud that we have been able to announce today that we will create an ability within the industrial umpire, Fair Work Australia, to resolve complaints about bullying. People who are being bullied at work should feel that there is somewhere that they can go where they will be treated sympathetically, where their complaints can be resolved. Our industrial umpire, created by this government, can and should play that role, and it will.                 Bullying has got no place in Australian workplaces. It has got no place in the treatment of young people. It should be part of our fair work system that complaints of this nature can be addressed, and we will bring to this parliament a proposition to ensure that in the future the umpire will be there to assist.

  Thank you very much. To assist the shadow minister, I should have said that I was quoting from the GST distribution review report. Let us go through the chronology so that it is very clear to everybody where this information is available. On 2 May 2010, the Henry review recommended a resource rent tax and the resource superprofits tax was announced. On 2 July 2010, I, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Resources and Energy entered a heads of agreement with some of Australia's biggest miners about a profits based tax. Then a policy transition group was led by Mr Don Argus - well-known in the resources sector - and Minister Ferguson. That was announced on 2 July. The membership and the terms of reference were announced on 3 August. It did its work and the report was received on 22 December 2010. On 24 March 2011, the government announced it would accept all 98 recommendations of the group. The government then formed the resource tax implementation group to work on legislative drafting. Then of course we in this parliament dealt with the legislation. The legislation was passed on 19 March 2012 and assented to on 29 March 2012. Issues involving state royalties were referred to the GST distribution group and its report was released on 30 November 2012. So it was available to anyone who wanted to study the issue and be fully apprised of the issues from 30 November 2012. So all of that work has been done, all of that work is available and all of that work is capable of being absorbed by anybody who wants to sit at a desk, read documents, think deeply and consider the nation's future.                     I am answering the shadow minister's original question, the one he asked. So all of that material has been available on the public record for people who are interested in public policy, the functioning of the economy, jobs and growth. That means, by definition of course, it has not been studied by the opposition, and that has been transparent today.                 What I would say to the opposition is that behind this little game they are playing today actually lie some very important questions for the Australian economy. Do you believe that Australians are entitled to the benefits of the mineral wealth in their grounds - yes or no? We say yes; you say no. If you do believe that, do you believe taxes should be efficient and profits based? We say yes; you say no. Do you believe it is appropriate for state governments to keep jacking up inefficient taxes on the minerals industry? We say no; you say yes to inefficient Liberal taxes. That is the nature of the political debate. Jobs and growth on this side; inability to deal with economic -

  I would like to thank the member for Deakin for his question. Labor believes that bullying has got no place in Australian workplaces. We believe that bullying is like racism and discrimination: it has no place in modern Australian workplaces. But what we do know, all too sadly, is that bullying does occur in Australian workplaces. It is real, it has a cost and it is hurtful. I have seen this first-hand, as has the member for Deakin and as has the state Attorney-General, Robert Clark. I am talking about the Panlock family, who lost a daughter. Brodie was bullied at a Hawthorn cafe. The investigations have found that she was bullied but those investigations came far too late, and she committed suicide. I cannot imagine the loss and I cannot imagine the life not lived.                 We could do better, we should do better and we shall do better. We shall amend the Fair Work Act. We shall provide timely, accessible, low-cost relief and remedy for people who have complaints of bullying in the workplace. I am grateful to the member for Kingston and her committee. She has helped guide us for a national definition on bullying. She has helped guide us about national training to deal with workplace bullying. Bullying means repeated, unreasonable behaviour towards a worker or a group of workers which creates a risk to health and safety. We will provide a mechanism whereby, if someone has a complaint, it can at least be listed to be solved within 14 days through the Fair Work Commission - Australia's industrial umpire. We are going to work with the state regulators, but we are taking workplace bullying and declaring that it is an issue to do with workplace relations. We have responded to the member for Kingston's report, and I would like to table that.                 For the record - and I would like to conclude on this: we do believe that workplace bullying is a workplace relations issue which deserves a workplace relations policy. Every member of the House - from Labor, the Liberals or the crossbenches - will have to make a decision on the issue of workplace bullying in the next few months. We will amend the Fair Work Act. I hope and I expect that the amendments we propose will be supported by everyone in the House, because what we are about with our workplace relations policy is productive workplaces and flexible workplaces, but, most importantly, safe workplaces.

  I do thank the shadow minister for his question. I think everybody on this side of the House is concerned about how competitive our mining taxation regime is, and the need for that went to the very core of the report that was produced by Mr Argus and Minister Ferguson. Nobody could fundamentally disagree with that. If you are rational and if you accept the facts, you would not fundamentally disagree with the proposition that royalties are inefficient, that royalties discourage investment, and that, if we are going to have an effective and efficient form of resource taxation in this country, it has to be some combination of resource rent taxation and the existing royalties regime.                 Of course, what we have seen occur in recent times is substantial royalty increases in some states which have deterred investment and which have punished some companies and punished employment, particularly in my home state of Queensland. Between the time that we announced the MRRT and we put it in operation, we saw the biggest surge in mining investment in our history in this country, with - and I will check this - an additional 53,000 jobs created in the mining sector. Why do I make that point? Because every one of those people opposite, when we introduced the MRRT, said it would be the opposite - they said investment would go out the back door, as would jobs. Of course, investment boomed and so, too, did jobs. But we do understand that there is an interaction between the two, which is why this matter was referred to the GST distribution panel and why it is now being dealt with at an officials level between state and federal Treasurers. That is how it has been dealt with because the interaction between the two is an important consideration. That point was made in the Argus-Ferguson report at some length, which, by the way, was a public process, a transparent process, which consulted right around the country - a very important report. We are working within those parameters because what we want for Australia is a resource pipeline that generates jobs and generates investment, and we make sure that, as a consequence of that, all Australians share in the benefit of that investment. This is where there is a fundamental difference of opinion, because those opposite think one dollar of a resource rent tax is too much, because they are down on bended knee to the mining billionaires.

  Thank you very much to the member for Hindmarsh, who does so much for pensioners in his electorate. He and everybody on this side of the parliament knows that pensioners can rely on Labor. They can rely on Labor governments. It was this government that delivered the biggest pension rise in Australia's history. Of course, we also delivered an improved indexation system to make sure that the value of the pension keeps up with pensioners' costs of living. We have seen millions of pensioners get an increase. If you are a single pensioner on the maximum rate, it is $172 a fortnight extra, and for couples it is $182 a fortnight extra - all because of this Labor government's reforms.                 Today I have announced that, from 20 March, we will see another improvement to the pension as a result of the reduction in the pension deeming rates. More than 740,000 pensioners will benefit from a higher pension. In South Australia, around 70,000 pensioners will benefit as a result of that decision. Part-pensioners will see an average increase to their pension of $6.80 a fortnight. Also from 20 March, Australian pensioners will start receiving the new clean energy supplement. Pensioners will get that either fortnightly or quarterly. Over the next year for single pensioners that will be worth around $338 annualised, and for a couple $510.                 Australian pensioners know they will be getting this extra money. What they also know is that this Leader of the Opposition is determined to claw that money back. We know when the Leader of the Opposition was a minister in the previous government he said no to a pension rise. He said no to a pension rise when he was in the cabinet. We know this was true.                     He says he never did. We know from your mate Mal Brough that that is exactly what you did. It was your mate Mal Brough that told the whole country that the Howard cabinet said no to a pension rise.                     And now you want to claw $300 out of the pockets of pensioners. Labor will make sure we look after pensioners, while you claw it back.

  I thank the member for Blair for that question because it is important that people in disaster affected areas know what help is available to them. I know that the member for Blair has put tremendous effort into helping his constituents to clean up, to get their lives back on their feet after they have been turned upside down, helping businesses open again and helping rebuild farms.                 The Commonwealth has moved very quickly to ensure that assistance is activated as soon as possible for those that need it. More than 300 Australian Defence Force personnel were deployed to assist with the emergency response and recovery efforts. Led by ADF Joint Task Force 637, Queensland flood assist 2 was on the job very quickly. We have signed a new national partnership agreement with Queensland for reconstruction and recovery. It is a significant effort that will speed up reconstruction and recovery. The Prime Minister has reappointed Senator Ludwig as the minister assisting her on the Queensland floods recovery.                 Australian families, business operators and farmers are a very resilient people. They will get through this disaster and they expect their local members, state and federal, and their state and federal governments to get on with the job of supporting them at this time.                 Members of parliament like the member for Blair have their constituents' interests at heart, and many members of the federal opposition, I am very pleased to say, have put their politics to one side and have worked tirelessly in their constituents' interests. Sadly, I cannot say the same for all members of the Liberal and National parties. But I would hope that, in times like this, all members of this place - and, indeed, of other parliaments - are able to put politics to one side and work with our national government. We do need to support those people who have had their lives turned upside down. That is what I will be doing. That is what this government will be doing. And I can report to the member for Blair that we are getting on with the job.                 Yesterday, the Prime Minister approved additional disaster assistance for those affected in South Burnett in Gladstone, Toowoomba, Ipswich and a number of other areas. That brings the number of local government areas receiving Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements assistance in Queensland to 53. We have paid $77.4 million in recovery support directly into people's bank accounts, which means that some 66,000 applicants from Queensland have been paid, with every eligible adult receiving $1,000 and $400 per child; that is the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment. Today I approved an extension of those payments for the people in South Burnett. The Gillard government will continue to support people devastated by disaster.

  My thanks to the member for Fowler for his question. Giving every Australian student the chance to have a great education is a core Labor value, and every member on this side of the chamber and, I surmise, the crossbenches too, gets the importance of education in a child's life. Every member on this side gets the importance of education for our economic future. Yesterday, here, I outlined the National Plan for School Improvement that will deliver reforms to quality teaching, school leadership and quality learning - reforms that are essential to drive improved results in our schools and are a necessary step in implementation of the National Plan for School Improvement. Part of that was the introduction into this House of the Australian Education Bill, an important bill that provides the directions for the National Plan for School Improvement.                 It is axiomatic that in this parliament we should be able to debate these issues. Of course, we are discussing the reforms with education ministers, parents and teachers, but today we have learned that the Manager of Opposition Business, the shadow spokesperson for education, has taken the extraordinary step of trying to shy away from the debate on this bill in this chamber. Many outside this House might not believe that - after all, this is a bill about how we can improve education in Australia - but it should not surprise those of us in the House when we consider the opposition's record: 11 years in office and they failed to get up a national curriculum; 11 years in office and they failed to fix a broken education funding model; 11 years in office and they failed to give more power to school principals. Eleven years in office - they could have built classrooms and libraries; they managed 3,000 flagpoles.                 In opposition they have been no better. In the 2010 election, what did we get? $2.8 billion to be cut from education investment. They rejected the Gonski review of school funding within 20 minutes after it was released, and of course the opposition spokesman on education is notorious for wanting to see one in seven teachers sacked. Then they tried to play catch-up policy, and we saw that education came in at number 17. Now, after all of that, we see the shadow minister for education in the federal opposition not wanting to stand in this parliament and debate the very matter for which he has responsibility, instead scampering out of the House like a startled gazelle while people here want to put their views about how we need a national plan for school improvement.                 At the end of the day, all I can say is this: we will continue to work with education authorities to implement the National Plan for School Improvement to build a stronger, smarter and fairer Australia, and let that debate continue in this place.

  Not to my knowledge. However, the leader of the opposition in Western Australia has made his position known publicly. He has made his position about a carbon tax known publicly. He has also made his position public that he supports an emissions trading scheme. Of course, the change that we have brought to our nation ensures that there will be an emissions trading scheme from 2015 and that, of course, was supported by the Leader of the Opposition as a minister in the Howard government in his book Battlelines, and on Lateline. An emissions trading scheme has been supported broadly by the opposition. Unfortunately for a negative fear campaign, the opposition traded in their position under the Howard government for negativity and they are still stuck there. However, as I understand it, Mr McGowan is in support of an emissions trading scheme. Pricing carbon is the right policy for our nation. Prime Minister Howard knew that. The Leader of the Opposition knew that when he sat around the cabinet table. They have replaced all of that, as you well know, with the cheap negativity we see today.

  I thank the member for Calwell for her question and her dedication to vocational education and training, and her support for the Kangan Institute of TAFE in her part of Melbourne. Vocational education qualifications are a passport to a better job, to a higher pay packet and to a secure future for so many Australians. Skills training is, of course, vital for our economy to ensure we have the skills we need. Of course TAFE is at the front line of this. The government are introducing reforms to create a more accessible and equitable training system, a more transparent vocational education system and a more efficient VET sector that responds to the needs of students, employers, and industry. We have invested at record levels to make this happen. We will invest more than $15 billion over the next four years in skills and training, and that compares to $9 billion for the last four years of the Howard government.                 I have been asked by the honourable member about the importance of training and about the implications of cuts. This is not a hypothetical question. We are seeing the implications of cuts to vocational education right up and down the eastern seaboard of Australia. Victoria has cut $300 million from the TAFE system. This will see campus closures, staff redundancies and course fees increase. The New South Wales government is sacking 800 TAFE teachers and students will be hit with a nine per cent TAFE fee increase. In Queensland, 13 campuses are being closed and Premier Newman is threatening to close 25 more TAFEs. These cuts represent a real risk to our economy and are affecting thousands of people.                 There are examples in the electorate of the member for Calwell and the member for Wills, who I know are very concerned about the threat of closing 52 courses at the Kangan Institute in areas like building, hospitality and business. To use just one example: the implications for Nadine, from the Member for Holt's electorate, a mother of twins from Cranbourne North who has had all her night classes cut in a diploma for community services. She now has to make the difficult decision about whether to work or study. These are the implications of the cuts. All members of this House should oppose these cuts and members on this side of the House do. But, alas, it is not the case for all members the House. The member for North Sydney has said Campbell Neman's cuts were 'pretty reasonable' and more power to his right arm. That shows you what will happen if he gets his hands on the purse strings. He has to find the $70 billion from somewhere and he will have vocational education and training in his sights because that is what Liberals do.

  Let me assure the Leader of the Opposition that this government will always properly cost policies and we will identify savings. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that, despite the carry-on on the other side, we have been offsetting new expenditure since 2009. I would remind the opposition of that.                 What I would remind the opposition of, as well, is that it is very important, in this year of all years, that Australians are able to compare policies, their merits, their costs and where the savings are coming from. I am indebted to the shadow minister for finance for clarifying, in the Federation Chamber yesterday, on behalf of the opposition:                 _ every day we hear in the main chamber _ and in the other place, cries of 'Where are your costings?'                 And he says, on behalf of the opposition:                 Of course the costings have been done.                 Then he goes on to say:                 What no-one knows, including us, is how any of these things can be funded.                 I think it ought to be very clear to the shadow minister for finance and to the opposition generally that what we need to do - what everyone needs to do - in this fiscal environment is identify offsetting savings for new expenditure.                     The member for Goldstein is yelling out, 'No, you don't,' which means that he must have a plan to add to expenditure. If his plan is not to add to expenditure then he must identify offsetting savings.                 The opposition is engaged in a fiction that this can only be done after the pre-election fiscal outlook is delivered. That is nonsense. Today, if the Leader of the Opposition is in possession of costed policies, he could start identifying the matching savings. If he does not do that transparently then Australians are entitled to conclude that that money will come in secret cuts in the way in which the Newman government has proceeded in Queensland. It is overseen by a commission of audit, but what it equals is cuts that cost jobs, cuts that destroy services, cuts that hit hospitals, cuts that hit schools.                 So if the Leader of the Opposition has a new-found interest in budget matters - if you have your costed policies, and your shadow minister for finance says that you do - he should put out the matching savings and allow Australians to judge them.

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question. I thank her for her deep interest and very vocal expression of the needs and desires of her constituents. Key to her constituents' making a life is the Australian economy and, indeed, the global economy's offer to them of the opportunity that comes with a job or the opportunity that comes with being able to create your own small business should you choose to do so.                 President Obama has just been delivering his fifth State of the Union address. President Obama, in that address, like leaders around the world, was focused on a strategy for jobs and growth in his nation. As I have said in the parliament this week, you cannot say that you are engaged in the public policy debates that matter in our world today unless you fully understand the causes and consequences of the global financial crisis.                 You cannot be viewed as a sophisticated participant in any debate about jobs and growth unless you are focused on that. The global financial crisis hit around the world; it hit here in Australia, and it particularly hit acutely in the United States. That means that around the world, nations - including our own - face challenges with ensuring that there are jobs and growth, and as a government we are very focused in meeting those challenges. Unlike President Obama and our friends in the United States of America, we come to addressing these challenges standing on a foundation of strength. Unlike the United States, we did not have a recession in this country. Unlike the United States, we were able to act in a timely way to support and protect jobs as we supported and protected 200,000 of them. Unlike the United States, we are here with growth, with low inflation, with low interest rates, with strong public finances. Unlike the United States, we can therefore build for the future and jobs and growth standing on that platform of strength coming out of the global financial crisis.                 In his own nation, President Obama still confronts the spectre of 12 million unemployed people; that is the same size of the entire Australian labour market. He therefore has a challenge that is different to ours, but in his address today to the State of the Union it is abundantly clear that his focus is on jobs and growth. That is good for the global economy and it is good for our economy. Our focus domestically, standing on a platform of strength, is for jobs and growth and opportunity for Australians for the future.

  I do thank the shadow Treasurer for his question, because I did answer that comprehensively yesterday. It is the case that they are a deductible credit - no doubt about that. That was contained in the report which was produced by the Minister for Resources and Energy, Mr Ferguson, and Mr Argus, along with some advice that we should sit down with the states and work our way through all of these issues, which is precisely what we are doing as we speak. Our treasuries are engaged in this discussion, and they are engaged in this discussion for a very good reason: we want our resources industries to grow and prosper. The whole argument for a resource rent tax is that it is the most efficient way of generating growth and jobs in industry, as opposed to the regressive impact of royalties and how they punish projects, particularly those which have higher costs.                 What you have seen in the state of Queensland has been jacking up of royalties, which has cost jobs. We have not heard one peep from them about the job-destroying impact of what has gone on in Queensland from the royalty increases by the Queensland government. We are determined to work through with the states the intersection of a resource rent tax with royalties. That is what we have said we are doing, we have been doing it and we will continue to do it because it goes to the health of our industry which has been growing dramatically since we announced the introduction of the MRRT in 2010. I went through some of the figures yesterday.                     Something like 60,000-plus jobs additional in mining when those opposite claimed that jobs would be reduced. We have seen a dramatic increase in investment since 2010 in mining, all because we have been determined -                      As the Argus-Ferguson process recommended and as the GST distribution panel recommended, we have been working with the states to see if we can get a resolution to this issue. I would have thought that that is a very clear answer to the shadow Treasurer. But what is he really on about here? He is upset that there is a resource rent tax in the first place, and $1 of tax raised through resource rent taxes is an affront to everybody on that side of the House. We on this side of the House have a fundamental belief that the Australian people should be getting a share in the superprofits that are made from the resources that we own 100 per cent. That is why we have been a supporter of the MRRT and that is why we have been a supporter of the PRRT, which has raised something like $28 billion in the time that it has been in operation. And it was opposed by those opposite.

  I thank the member for Makin for his question. Jobs and growth drive every decision that this government takes when it comes to our economic settings and the future of the country. We understand how important a job is to a family, not just in terms of the future but in terms of the cost-of-living pressures. Those opposite do not understand that. I was pleased to see, as the Prime Minister said before, the American President today reaffirm how important it is to have a growing economy to secure prosperity, to secure good living standards and, most particularly, to secure jobs, which are the foundation of the peace of mind of all of our people. He made the point that a growing economy supports middle-class jobs. This is a government that has been driven by that ambition every day that we have been in office.                 As the Prime Minister said before, it is disappointing to see that those opposite do not share this view. They have the view that they have to take a sledgehammer to our economy like the sledgehammer that has been taken to the Queensland economy by the Queensland Premier. They have ticked off on just about every one of those cuts in Queensland, all of them damaging to growths and to jobs in the Queensland community.                 Central to generating jobs and growth is good fiscal policy, and that fiscal policy has to be absolutely transparent. We have been accountable for our fiscal policy through budgets, mid-year updates and economic statements at every turn during the five years that we have been in office. That is absolutely essential to supporting jobs and growth. Those opposite do not support that approach. Not once in five years have they put forward a carefully costed policy that has passed the costing test - not once.                     Indeed. I was making the point that carefully costed policies are what support jobs and growth in our economy. We had the shadow Treasurer yesterday refusing to release any policies. But then we had the contrast, with the shadow finance minister telling the parliament that of course the costings have been done. That is what he said in the second chamber. Why on earth is the shadow Treasurer hiding the costings that have been done by the shadow finance minister? They come in here every day and claim that the government is spending too much and is too big. And then they say, 'But we can't tell you what our costings are; we can't tell you where we are going to cut.' If you think government is too big, come in here and announce your costings; come in here and tell the Australian people how you are going to find $70 billion worth of savings. We know how you will do it: the schoolkids bonus will be gone, the tripling of the tax-free threshold will be gone; superannuation will be gone -

  Very simply because that project is already in the bottom line. The money is already being provided and the Gateway project is taking place. I know that those opposite are acutely embarrassed by the fact that the Gateway project is being built.                     We are funding and have in our budget bottom line all of the projects that we have made our commitments to. I know there is a lot of embarrassment on that side of the House. There is acute embarrassment on that side of the House. Up the back, we have a member from Perth who has attended the opening of a project that we are building in Perth - a project that he supports, a project that is figured into our budget bottom line and has been funded - and he is up saying he does not want it. If he does not want it, he should not have gone to the opening.                 What we are seeing here is a taste of what is going to come. Those on the other side of the House might laugh like hyenas now, but the fact is that, when they are forced to put their costings out and when they are forced to account for at least a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line, there are not going to be many smiles on the faces of those opposite, because we have already seen the leading edge of what they are going to do. They are going to get rid of the schoolkids bonus - gone. They are going to get rid of payments for superannuation and low-income workers - gone. They are going to get rid of the instant asset write-off - gone.                     As we go through those lists and the massive cuts to health and education, all of those on that side of the House will be exposed through their agenda.                   The member for North Sydney then left the chamber.

  I thank the member for New England for his question. As I indicated in an answer to a question last week, the meat processing sector is undergoing significant changes as a consequence of the implementation of the carbon price. Those are positive changes that will reduce emissions, reduce costs and improve productivity and competitiveness. That is the fact of the matter. The industry is starting to invest in new equipment to reduce energy use, to cut its emissions and to drive unprecedented improvements in many of these facilities. This is being done in a number of cases with assistance from government grants funded by the carbon price. The member for New England has been a strong advocate for these changes in the industry and very supportive of it in the last couple of years in particular. In his own electorate, Teys, in Tamworth, has received a $330,000 grant funded by the carbon price to install a biogas system which derives renewable energy from the waste materials at the facility. That alone is going to cut the company's energy costs by almost $330,000 a year.                 The member indicated that in his electorate Bindaree Beef are looking to invest in what is called a biodigester, which will reduce its energy use and cut its emissions very significantly. A biodigester takes the waste products from the meat processing process - if I can be indelicate about it, that is essentially the blood and guts from the abattoir - takes it through a chemical process and converts it into useful materials, including methane, that can be used to generate electricity. It also produces fertiliser and produces, for those courageous enough to drink it, drinkable water. These are extremely important improvements that can very significantly enhance the productivity and competitiveness of a facility. Even the carbon dioxide by-product from the biodigester can be used, for example, in hothouses for the production of crops.                 These are very important changes in the industry. They are all coming about as a consequence of carbon pricing coming into our economy and having very positive impacts. By the end of this year, the fact of the matter is that there will be approximately one billion people living in jurisdictions where a carbon price is in operation, and it is fundamentally important for the future of our economy that we are making that reform, that we are ahead of the game in making these changes in our meat processing sector and ensuring that we are benefitting from the development of clean energy in our economy. Finally, I note that President Obama in the State of the Union address today indicated very clearly and very unequivocally that he expects the congress to develop a market-based mechanism to address climate change and introduce a carbon price into the US economy. He has indicated furthermore that he will take executive steps to implement -

  I thank the member for Throsby for his question. He knows, as I and the broader Australian community know, that the introduction of the MRRT has not had a negative impact on investment in the Australian resources sector. The reason for that is that, in designing the MRRT, one of our primary objectives was to ensure that we remained attractive for overseas investment - and, I might say, for domestic sector investment.                 The House should also be reminded of the fact that the MRRT is the type of tax the resources sector wanted - it is a profits based tax. Just like the coalition opposed the introduction of the PRRT, and we have seen Australia reap the benefits of that tax, so has it opposed the development of the MRRT. But it has been silent in the last 12 months on decisions by coalition governments in New South Wales and Queensland to increase inefficient royalty taxes, which have had a negative impact on the Australian resources sector on the east coast of Australia.                 But let's go through some of the key indicators. Australia has had 21 years of consecutive economic growth, and the resources sector has been the key to that economic growth. But, perhaps more importantly, the Australian resources sector accounts for 16 to 17 per cent of Australia's GDP - and, interestingly, has expanded by around 12 per cent over the last year. Australian resources and energy export earnings reached a record high of $193 billion in 2011-12. They are projected to grow to $225 billion in 2016-17.                 Let's go to the all-important question of jobs - something the coalition leader does not pay adequate attention to. In 2011-12 total employment in the Australian mining, oil and gas extraction sectors averaged around 248,000 people - 20 per cent higher than in 2010-11. Let's go to the issue of investment. Committed capital investment in the resources sector in Australia today is $280 billion - $180 billion in offshore LNG, and investments in key industries such as coal and iron ore.                 But my view of the Australian resources sector and the MRRT is not just the view of the government. I refer to the statement of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of 5 February this year, the most recent Reserve Bank board discussion. It says:                 In Australia, most indicators available for this meeting suggest that growth was close to trend _ led by very large increases in capital spending in the resources sector _                 The independent Reserve Bank board also backs my analysis that the MRRT has not been a negative for resource investment in Australia. It is about time the opposition got on board and recognised that the MRRT is good for Australia.

  I am invited to make a few comments about the economy. I am invited to make a few comments about resource rent taxes. And I am only too pleased to do so.                 I would like to say, first of all, that the job creation record of this government over the past five years of 850,000 jobs is unequalled anywhere in the world. One of the reasons we have been able to do that is that this side of the House has had the courage of its convictions to put in place policies which support jobs and growth. The consequence of that has been that we did not go into recession, unlike most other countries in the developed world. Everyone on this side of the House is proud of that record - everybody is proud of it. As we go forward for the next five years, what we need is a range of policies to build future prosperity and to spread opportunity, and part and parcel of that is resource rent taxation - indeed, as it was 25 years ago, with the PRRT, which since that time has raised $28 billion.                 It is the case that, in the second half of last year, which coincided with the first two quarters of the MRRT, there was a huge crash in resource prices. The consequence of that has been less revenue. But that does not mean that an MRRT is not important not just for now but for our children and for our grandchildren - it is terribly important, to be part and parcel of a range of revenue streams so we can provide the money for the education and the health care of all of our  people. That is why we on this side of the House understand the importance of resource rent taxation: because it gives all Australians a stake in our future prosperity - all Australians.                 The opposite opinion is that on the other side of the House. They do not believe that all Australians should have a stake in our prosperity. They do not believe that we should spread opportunity through profit based taxes. All of our profit based taxes - company tax, capital gains tax, superannuation tax, resource rent taxes - have taken a very substantial hit from global volatility at the end of last year. But for the long term this is precisely the reform the country requires to provide the resources for all Australians so they have a stake in our prosperity.

  I thank the member for Wakefield, who has a keen interest in manufacturing policy in particular, with General Motors Holden located in his electorate and many of the workers living in that area. The fact of the matter is that we have very strong economic foundations in this country. When you look at it, particularly by comparisons internationally, we unquestionably have a strong economy - we have good GDP growth, we have low unemployment, we have contained inflation, we have had interest rates coming down and we have a very strong pipeline of private sector investment. This is a good investment environment, and the fundamentals are undoubtedly strong.                 But the government realises, of course, that there are some sectors of the economy that are facing some pressures, particularly from the high value of the Australian dollar.                 One of those industries, for example, is the automotive manufacturing sector. It is one of the reasons why the government has worked with and investing in the industry - to improve productivity, to improve competitiveness and to support jobs.                 A great example of that is our $40 million co-investment with General Motors Holden. That investment is one of the reasons that Holden has been able to design, engineer and build the new Commodore, which will not only be sold in Australia but also be exported to the US market. It will support thousands of jobs in the electorate of Wakefield and the northern area of Adelaide in particular. The investments that we are making in the auto industry are designed to assist the industry, through very difficult times, to achieve a competitive position when our exchange rate is at parity with the US dollar and to support no fewer than 250,000 jobs in that industry.                 All of that is at risk because the coalition has a policy of abolishing $1.5 billion worth of that assistance, of that co-investment with the motor vehicle -                      That is a very important policy comparison. The fact of the matter is that there are very significant differences between the two. All of those jobs in the automotive manufacturing sector, in the electorate of Wakefield and many others, are fundamentally dependent upon important partnerships between the industry and government. The coalition represents a risk to every single one of those jobs through that investment strategy.                   We are seeing that strategy work. The government are working closely with manufacturing industry more generally - and we will soon have more to say about it. We are determined to maximise the opportunities for Australian workers in manufacturing, to work with the industry to become competitive in the tough circumstances that are currently facing us and to bring the best minds in business and in research together to make sure that we meet the competitive challenges of the future. On the other side, there is no policy. There is no policy but a threat to people's jobs.

  I thank the shadow minister for his question as part of the opposition's new positive strategy of ideas and plans for the nation's future! In answer to the opposition's question: first and foremost, we have made arrangements for our nation to seize a clean energy future, to reduce carbon pollution and to make sure that we get the benefits of jobs and opportunity in the future. We have done what Prime Minister Howard intended to do before he lost the election in 2007: we have introduced a market based mechanism to price carbon, which will give our nation an emissions trading scheme - something that the Leader of the Opposition and every serving member who was here in 2007 was in favour of at the time.                 Of course, what we have seen since is - as the minister would say - the most mendacious campaign in Australia's history. It is full of false representations and untruths that have been peddled to the Australian people and that have been shown time after time to be untrue. The Leader of the Opposition has not at any point indicated to the Australian people that those claims have been withdrawn. He has ceased to make them because he knows how untrue they are. The claims about job losses are wrong, the claims about astronomical increases in the cost of living are wrong, the claims about $100 roasts are wrong, the claims about Whyalla being wiped off the map are wrong and the claims that carbon pollution would just go up and up are wrong - have a look at the emissions reductions that we have seen of late. All of these claims are wrong. Today we have seen President Obama, in the state of the union address, talk about the importance in his nation of bipartisanship and a market based mechanism to deal with carbon pollution.                 On the question of asylum seekers we faced months and months of negativity from the opposition, preventing this government from getting on with the job after a High Court decision that left this government -                      with fewer powers to act than governments in the past. If the opposition was genuinely concerned about asylum seekers then it would have joined in a bipartisan effort to deal with the problem at that time. Instead, it went negative and hoped for more boats.                 On the minerals resource rent tax, I stand by the proposition that -                      the Australian public are entitled to the benefits of the mineral wealth in their grounds and that the taxation of the resources sector should be an efficient, profits based tax, not the jacking up of royalties by state Liberal governments, costing jobs - every one of them ticked by the Leader of the Opposition. If there is ever a time that the opposition wants to debate policy, let us know - we have not seen it yet.

  I thank the member for Shortland for her question. She takes a great interest in the working conditions of working Australians. In fact, all this week, I can report to the House, Labor has been up-front about its workplace relations policy.                 We have been up-front about our desire to improve flexibility for Australian workers. We have been up-front about our desire to improve harmonious workplace relationships so we can build jobs and growth in Australia.                 So I am pleased to advise the House, and the people listening to parliament, that today - yet again - the Gillard Labor government is going to assist the parents of newborn children; we are going to assist pregnant workers with changes to ensure better workplaces for Australia. We shall increase the amount of unpaid parental leave that parents are entitled to take together from three to eight weeks. Members of the  House, that is flexibility. We shall support parents to choose when they can take unpaid parental leave together. That is flexibility. We shall support pregnant women at work by ensuring that they can transfer to a safe job regardless of their length of service. We shall ensure that women who need to take unpaid special maternity leave are not penalised by a decrease in the leave that they are eligible for after the baby is born.                 Members of the House, this is flexibility; this is supporting women to participate in the economy, and this is supporting better workplaces. Labor understands what it means to make a modern workplace, fit for modern families. We understand that pregnant women should be entitled to safe jobs. We understand that you should not suffer disadvantage if you are sick while you are pregnant. We understand that dads want to spend more time with their families. In fact, all this week we have been standing up front revealing our policies, revealing our plans. We can do this, because we have a plan that is positive for Australian workers. We can do this all week, unlike those opposite, because you do not have a plan for workplace relations in Australia. Your plan for workplace relations is to cut penalty rates, to cut shift loadings. Your plan, as we have seen -                      They have said that they do not want us to help victims of workplace bullying through amending the Fair Work Act. I think it is time for the opposition to come clean and be up-front about their workplace relations policy, because until you do there is no way that working Australians will ever trust you on workplace relations.

  For the benefit of the member who asked the question and those on that side of the House, as well as the member for Denison, I will explain the way in which the budget works and forecasts are done. I am surprised that the member asking the question does not know, given that she served as a minister in a government. But apparently, from the question, she does not. So let's go through the way it works.                 What government does is we make decisions, we make policies, we make budgets, we make fiscal strategies. We work with the experts at Treasury, who ensure, with the experts at Finance, that policies are costed and that budget projections are done, including revenue projections. So I would remind the member who asked the question that the revenue projections, whether they are for the minerals resource rent tax, whether they are for company tax, whether they are in fact for personal tax - the tax that workers pay - or whether they are for capital gains tax, are put together by experts at Treasury using the best of their expertise, all with goodwill. It is done for this government; it was done for governments in the past, including the Howard government; and it will be done for governments in the future.                 Then, of course, we see the actual performance against their forecasts and projections, and there are times in which there is a variance between the two. There is a variance now across many of the revenue categories of government, which was not forecast by Treasury and which means that we are seeing revenue, as a percentage of GDP, at its lowest point since the 1990s. That is, revenue has not returned in the way in which Treasury has predicted. So it is defying the usual economic orthodoxy and economic models.                 There are a variety of factors feeding into this. Commodity price volatility is certainly one of them. And the high Australian dollar is certainly a very strong factor feeding into it. Not only does it press on industry sectors like manufacturing and tourism and suppress profits, but it actually has implications for the resources sector when contracts are priced in American dollars. Then, of course, continued sluggishness in the global economy also has implications for the Australian economy for revenue and for projections.                 The member opposite, in asking the question, should recognise the importance of understanding these factors to being able to project plans for jobs and growth in the future. So no-one should go around insulting the professionals at Treasury. That is not appropriate and not right. We will continue to focus on jobs and growth, despite the negativity of those opposite.

  I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. As was anticipated, in his State of the Union address today President Obama made some important remarks about progress in Afghanistan. In particular, the President has announced the plans of the United States of America for the gradual draw-down of its own troops currently in Afghanistan.                 In Afghanistan the United States currently has around 68,000 troops. President Obama has outlined the gradual draw-down of these troops as we move to Afghan led security of the Afghan nation. I would remind the House that we expect Afghan forces, by around the middle of this year, to be in the lead for security across all of Afghanistan.                 I welcome the announcement by President Obama today, and I was pleased to discuss it and its implications with the US Defense secretary Leon Panetta this morning. We had the opportunity to talk about President Obama's announcement and what that means for the transition strategy in Afghanistan.                 The NATO ISAF transition strategy in Afghanistan is working and is on track. What the transition strategy means is that, as Afghan local forces step up, the international community takes a step back. The fact that this can happen reflects the progress we have made in Afghanistan. It reflects the increasing capabilities of local forces, the significant weakening of the insurgency and the fact that al-Qaeda has been hit hard. Australia is leading the transition process in Uruzgan province and we expect this to be completed by the end of 2013. At the same time, we are working with the United States and other fellow NATO ISAF members to plan for the post-2014 period.                 We have a long-term development partnership with Afghanistan. We have said we will participate in the NATO train, advise and assist mission in the post-2014 period. We have made a substantial financial contribution to sustaining local forces beyond 2014, and we have indicated we would consider special forces having an ongoing role under the right mandate. We continue to support the peace and reconciliation process that needs to be and is Afghan led. We do not underestimate the challenges ahead but our goal of an Afghanistan that will never again be a safe haven for international terrorism is within reach.

  I thank the member for her question. Given the fine track record of the government in this parliament working with independent members of parliament in passing legislation, despite the relentless negativity of those opposite, any reasonable person would have to conclude that both the Leader of Government Business, the chief whip, and the whips who assist him are doing a very good job indeed.                     I am getting very good support for that statement from one source on the front bench, from Minister Albanese. What, of course, that means is that in this parliament we have had to go to extraordinary efforts to make sure that, despite the relentless negativity of the opposition, we have been able to get big things done.                     Thank you very much. I was actually asked a very broad question, and if the opposition wanted to draft it differently, then they should have done so. Having been asked a very broad question, I will answer it. The role of the Chief Government Whip goes to the functioning of the parliament. The functioning of the parliament is important because what happens here actually makes a difference to the lives and opportunities of Australians. It can be very hard, indeed, to diagnose from the conduct of the opposition that this parliament has that job, but we take it seriously. We take it seriously every day. Despite the games and the stunts and the negativity and the carping, we get on with the job every day of ensuring that Australians can live lives of opportunity and they can look forward to a better future. That is so that we can truly say as a nation that we will acquit our promise to the next generation of making sure that they get to lead lives of greater opportunity and prosperity than we ourselves have lived. In order to do that, we not only have the support modern families who are getting about the hard work of raising kids and supporting elderly parents today, we have got to make sure that we are building a nation for tomorrow that offers people the benefit of jobs and opportunity.                 That means it is important for us to be able to explain to the Australian people what is happening in our region, and the opportunities and challenges it brings, and to explain to Australians what is happening in the global community in the aftershocks of the global financial crisis. And we can chart a course that will mean opportunity and prosperity in the future for them and for their families - economic growth, jobs, clean energy, infrastructure, the NBN, skills, a better approach to regulation, better schools, better hospitals, better early childhood education and closing the gap for Indigenous Australians. These are the policies, these are the plans, that drive this government on and ensure that in this parliament we work hard, whether it is the Chief Government Whip or any other member, to deliver for the Australian people.

  I thank the member for her question and acknowledge her interest in defence and national security matters. I also acknowledge her support of the Australian Defence Force.                 We are making good progress in the transition in Uruzgan province, and we confidently expect the transition will be completed in Uruzgan by the end of this year, which is earlier than previously anticipated. As a consequence of that, this year in Uruzgan our focus will be threefold. Firstly, we are advising the kandaks of the 4th Brigade of the Afghan National Army to put them in a position by the end of the year to complete transition and take responsibility for security matters. Secondly, we are focusing on the complex task of redeploying our personnel and our equipment - in other words, the complex task of bringing our troops and our kit home. Finally, we have to concentrate and think very carefully about our post 2014 - our post transition - contribution to Afghanistan.                 In recent times we have seen the good progress on transition in Uruzgan reflected by the fact that the four infantry kandaks of the ANA are all now operating independently - that has been the case since November last year. We are no longer conducting joint patrols. We have handed over the forward operating bases and patrol bases to the ANA. We have consolidated our position at our base in Tarin Kot. All of these things point to lead security responsibility by the Afghans in Uruzgan by the end of the year. Consistent with the Chicago and Lisbon strategies and summits, we of course remain combat ready if required and our special forces continue to operate. As the transition occurs there will be changes in the composition and level of our deployment in Afghanistan, but we will not know the detail of that until the middle or the end of this year. The detail will become clearer.                 As I have said, we also need to give careful thought to our post-2014 arrangement. Here, the contribution today of the United States President during his State of the Union address is particularly pertinent, underlining and reaffirming the United States's long-term, enduring commitment to Afghanistan. In recent days and weeks we have had careful consultation with our United States colleagues - whether it was the Prime Minister with the Secretary of Defense this morning, my conversation with him last week or the Chief of Defence Force's regular conversations with Comm ISAF, General Allen and now General Dunford, or with the commander of the United States Central Forces, General Mattis. These consultations will now focus on our post-2014 contribution. We have made it clear that that will include, potentially, training and special forces.                 I finish on this point: as our troops and our kit come home there will of course be a special responsibility to focus on the troops when they return - the care of our wounded warriors, whether those wounds are physical or mental.

  I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. I must admit I did not notice that he was at the ALP candidates seminar, but I am not surprised! I am not surprised that he is just taking out a little bit of insurance, and I am not surprised that he would like to be at a meeting where there are no climate change deniers and where people, like him, believe in a market based solution to carbon pollution. So, if he is ever feeling the need to talk to people who are actually on the right side of history when it comes to carbon, he will be very welcome indeed.                 Then there is the question of being on the right side of history in terms of rolling out the infrastructure that our nation needs now and making sure that our nation does not get left behind. At every stage in history, when it comes to big projects, there are sceptics around. There were those who thought that the telephone line was unnecessary, that you would always be able to find a messenger boy to take your slip of paper to the neighbouring household. There were those who thought we should not have got on with the Snowy Mountains scheme. They were called the Liberal Party. They thought we should not get on with that nation-building project. So it is unsurprising that in the modern age, when it comes to the next generation of nation-building infrastructure, those on the other side are the ones carping and carrying on. What they would want to see is our nation confined to dial-up or to ADSL, while the rest of the world has moved on. Businesses looking to locate where infrastructure for the moving of information would be absolutely pivotal to them would pass Australia by because we did not have the National Broadband Network -                      I am just concerned now that relentless negativity has infected everyone. But to return to the member's question, we said that we would have commenced or passed 750,000 premises by the end of last year and we delivered that. We said we would be working on or passing over one million premises by mid this year and we are on track to do that. Whilst we have got on with rolling out the infrastructure of the future, those opposite have voted against the National Broadband Network 14 times, and I have lost count of the number of broadband policies they have tried to cobble together and put into the public domain. We will stay on the right side of history and get on with the job.

  I thank the member for Fowler and acknowledge his strong advocacy for both jobs and particularly jobs expos in his area. I know that, like I am, he is proud of the over 850,000 jobs that have been created since we came to government. We are proud that we took the strong action, that we avoided recession and that we still stand with a low unemployment rate in stark contrast to much of the world. But, mostly, we are proud because we know that through real policies, real investments and real actions we are ensuring that more Australians get the benefits of work as a result of all of these policies. We know that working parents need affordable childcare solutions in order to be able to fully participate in the labour market. That is why we delivered a tripling of the budget that goes to the sector. That is why we increased the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, massively reducing the percentage of disposable income which is going on childcare fees across every income level. That is why we funded a 42 per cent increase in the number of childcare services across Australia.                 In contrast to these real actions, those opposite do not have a single childcare policy, except that they will do a review after the election and place into question the quantum of funding that will go to the sector into the future. We know that there are some parts of Australia that are not sharing equally in our prosperity, and whilst those opposite offer no policies, no solutions, we are working at the grassroots to deliver real programs to those most in need. We have held jobs expos right around the country in the areas that need it the most and through those expos we have already placed over 24,000 Australians back into jobs, and we have another 11 expos yet to go this year.                 We placed local employment coordinators on the ground in the 20 areas where help is needed the most, delivering real local solutions and real local policies, and we are also working to ensure that no groups of Australians are sidelined from our employment market. On this side we have heard from mature-aged Australians who feel like they have been disregarded, that they had been unappreciated and that they have been shut out of the labour market be too long. We have heard from them and we have responded with real action and $55 million in new programs that have already assisted over 10,000 older Australians. We have taken real action. Those opposite have labelled it as window-dressing, offered nothing positive, no policy and no solutions. We know that jobs have been central to this government and we are proud of what we have delivered. We know that the sound bites and the negativity that those opposite offer will do nothing to deliver any such results. This is because our hard work, our real policies and our real investment, and Australians deserve absolutely nothing less.

  I refer to my answers earlier this week on this question. I do believe that Australians are entitled to a share of the mineral wealth within their grounds. I do believe that businesses, at the peak of the profitability cycle, should pay a tax: the minerals resource rent tax. I worked hard with Australia's biggest miners to make sure that we had an agreement and got this done. It is, unashamedly, a profits based tax. We have seen volatility in commodity prices, we have seen a strong Australian dollar, and that has had implications for revenues. But, as the Treasurer has said to this House repeatedly across this week, when you design an arrangement like the minerals resource rent tax you are designing a revenue stream that matters to the nation not just now but into the future. It will matter to the nation's children and grandchildren.                 I have to say that I am a little bit surprised that the Leader of the Opposition would today, of all days, decide to ask a question on tax, because the Leader of the Opposition has been out doing media interviews today, and it is no surprise that they have retired him from breakfast television because he just cannot hold up under questioning. The Leader of the Opposition has said today that the right amount of company tax is the current rate. What that means is one of three things: he has walked away from his paid parental scheme -                      My point to the parliament is this: we are very happy to debate, in this parliament and beyond, economic matters and taxation matters based on the facts and based on a real understanding of the future. What is apparent from the Leader of the Opposition's media interviews today is that he cannot hold up in a discussion on tax policy, not even his own, for five minutes. He does not even know his own tax policy. He has made a major gaffe today. He needs to be explaining to the Australian people how, if the current amount of company tax is right, is he going to fund his paid parental leave scheme? Has he cancelled his paid parental leave scheme? Or is he out looking for another $2.7 billion worth of cuts?

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I know his part of Melbourne well and I know that his part of Melbourne is full of families who do face the pressures of juggling modern life. They are families where dad works, where overwhelmingly mum works too, where they are putting together a combination of jobs - a full-time job, a part-time job, two full-time jobs - in order to help families make ends meet. That does put real pressure on. What modern families need are modern workplaces which help them balance work and family life.                  We understand that we do not live in a world of 'nine to five' work, with a parent at home. That means that the pressure can be there, when you have to care for the kids, when you have to make arrangements for ageing parents and their care, and when you are coming back to work after having had a child. That is why across this week we have announced a new series of policies to help families with these modern pressures. We have specifically said that we will extend the National Employment Standards - part of the system we put into place to get rid of the hated Work Choices - to provide the right to request flexible work arrangements for more workers, for carers, for mature-age workers, for workers with school-age children and those experiencing or caring for those undergoing domestic violence or recovering from it.                 We will also make it clear to employers and employees how to reasonably deal with these requests. We are making it easier for mums who are returning to work, having had a child, to request part-time work arrangements so that they do not have to choose between work and family and so that it can be easier to balance, putting the two together. We are better protecting mums-to-be by ensuring that they can get transferred to a safe job, whether or not they have been with their employer for a year. We are also boosting protections for workers against having their rosters and hours of work unexpectedly changed. People obviously organise their lives - their child care, their pick-up of the kids from school, the help that they provide aged parents - around their roster and all of these arrangements can be disrupted by an unexpected change. And we are addressing the modern challenge of workplace bullying. Too many young people in particular have lived with this burden of bullying, not knowing who to go to. We will make sure that the industrial umpire is there to help them.                 During the week to come we will be outlining our plan for Australian jobs, but we will always ensure that workplaces have fair and decent working conditions, and we have added to that fairness and that decency this week.

  I am delighted to receive a question on tax from the shadow Treasurer, absolutely delighted, because like everyone on this side of the House I am proud of our record when it comes, in particular, to personal income tax - $47 billion worth of income tax cuts. Of course, the measure that I am most proud of and that is most important, particularly in terms of fairness to the low-paid workers, is the tripling of the tax-free threshold. Workers do not pay a dollar of tax until they earn $18,200. So a combination of those measures means that someone who was on $50,000 is paying $2,000 less in tax each and every year. I think that is a pretty good record.                 What we understand is that it is very important for working families to get a fair go in the tax system. The only one advocating an increase in tax in this House is in fact the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is going to increase the corporate rate of tax to fund his PPL scheme for millionaires. He is on the record saying that, yet he denied that this morning. But, even worse than that, those opposite have said very, very clearly that they intend to abolish the tripling of the tax-free threshold. What that means is a tax hike for over six million Australians.                     I do thank him for his assistance, because what he is really pointing to is that those opposite do have a plan: to smash hardworking Australian families by abolishing the tripling of the tax-free threshold. On top of that, they have their Coles and Woolies tax - the one denied by the Leader of the Opposition this morning. The fact is that they have a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line, and a consequence of that is a set of policies to smash hardworking Australians.

  I certainly do welcome that supplementary. There are two proposals to increase taxation in this parliament, and both of them come from that side of the House: the Leader of the Opposition's proposal to increase company tax on the largest, and medium sized, Australian companies and, in addition to that, to give a tax increase of up to $600 or $500 for people who are on the lowest incomes in our community. We know what the priorities are here. We stand for low-income earners. Those opposite go down on bended knee to the mining billionaires.

  I thank the member for her question, because this afternoon I am flying off to Moscow for the G20 finance ministers meeting.                     It is very important. I know those opposite are not interested in the facts of the national economy or the global economy. But, most importantly it is an opportunity to take the temperature of the global economy and to sit around the table with the finance ministers from the 20 countries who make up the G20. What is important about that is that, when you sit there and look at all of the developed economies, you see there is one thing very different about the other developed economies around the table: every single one of them went into recession during the global financial crisis. This reminds us of how well Australia did and is continuing to do, given the consequences of the global financial crisis.                 What it really points to is the fact that this government got the big economic calls right every step of the way when there were challenges in the global economy. A consequence of that is the creation of something like 850,000 jobs. Of course, if those opposite had had their way, we know what would have happened: Australia would have gone into recession and hundreds of thousands of people would have lost their jobs. We on this side of the House put jobs and growth first, unlike those opposite. We understand that to get jobs and growth you have to put in place some of the most significant economic reforms which will generate prosperity into the future, and carbon pricing is one such reform. But of course to get in place those reforms you have to do it in a methodical and responsible way. That is what you need to do when you are putting in place big reforms.                 We have seen another leak from those opposite over the past 24 hours. There have been so many leaks now there is a very big hole in their policy dike, I can tell you. What we have seen is a proposal, a $30 billion proposal, to float large plastic water bags up the Queensland coast! That is simply bizarre. It is like something out of a Woody Allen movie. The facts are: $30 billion, in terms of dams and floating water up the coast; a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line - no wonder the shadow Treasurer over there is using every excuse under the sun to avoid putting his policies out there for scrutiny, because what this demonstrates, yet again, is the size of the hole in their budget bottom line, and the fact that the price will be paid by working Australians, to fill that hole, because we know what they are going to do. They are going to abolish the schoolkids bonus - gone; abolish the contribution to the superannuation savings of the lowest income workers in Australia - gone; abolish pension increases - gone; abolish the instant asset write-off - gone. This means damage to working Australians and small business.

  Let me say to the Leader of the National Party: I most certainly will not join with the coalition in attacking the superannuation benefits of low-income Australians. I will not join with the Leader of the Opposition in attacking 2.1 million working women. I will not join with the Leader of the Opposition in attacking more than three million low-income Australians and attacking their retirement savings. We will not do that. And I will not join with the Leader of the Opposition in attacking superannuation for working Australians and preventing contributions from rising from nine to 12 per cent. I want to see working Australians able to retire with a decent retirement income, and I will not join with the Leader of the Opposition in -                      Well, I think people are entitled to the contrast. So on this side: super, from nine to 12. On this side: care and concern for low-income Australians. On this side: a plan to support low-income working women, not hit them with a cut.                     I was asked about stability and certainty in superannuation and I am addressing that question. I can very clearly say to working Australians: under this government they will see their superannuation contributions rise from nine to 12 per cent. I can say to low-income working Australians, disproportionately women, that under this government they will see benefits that assist them with their superannuation. Yes, there are attacks on certainty and stability for those Australians in the superannuation system, and they come from the Leader of the Opposition's plans to attack the superannuation of working people. Why? Because he has always thought superannuation was a con - his words, not mine.

  I thank the member for Fisher for his question. I can get some questions from those opposite, just not from the shadow minister. Indeed, we have significantly increased funding for the Bruce Highway: some $3.3 billion in funding for the Bruce Highway. This compares with $1.3 billion over 12 long years from those opposite - investing more than twice as much in half the time. Our record is: we are currently putting some 3,500 people to work rebuilding more than 90 kilometres of the highway right now, and during the break I opened section B of the Cooroy to Curra upgrade - promised, funded, constructed and opened under this government. I also announced joint funding with the Queensland government of $790 million for the section A upgrade. These are the sections of the highway that are in the electorate of the member for Wide Bay, the shadow minister. He was the minister for transport who described this section as the worst section of road in Australia but could not deliver a cent in spite of the fact that he was the local member and the minister; he could not even turn up to the road opening, so embarrassed was he.                 And just today I have announced funding in the electorate of the member for Fisher of $80.7 million for a new interchange at Roys Road and Bells Creek Road near Beerwah, with work to start in the middle of this year. Ten people have lost their lives on this two-kilometre stretch of the Bruce Highway since 2002 - I have had representations from the member for Fisher, as well as other community members, about this - and this is why it is important for this funding to proceed.                 What I can guarantee also is the work we are doing further north of the member's electorate, on the Bruce Highway from Cabbage Tree Creek to Carmen Road. What I can guarantee is that we will have real projects with real funding and real time frames. And there is some support from those opposite. Indeed, the member for Herbert had this to say:                 I'll give Labor a pat on the back and say they have spent more in their four or five years on the Bruce Highway than we did before.                 That is what they say in their electorates, because they know that it is the case. They are embarrassed by the performance of the member for Wide Bay, that is why there has been no opportunity to ask a question on infrastructure since 2010 given by the Leader of the National Party.

  I want to thank both the member for Bass and the member for Riverina for their comments on that question. It is no surprise at the question coming from the member for Bass, because he is aware of the whole midlands project that we have done through Tasmania: the building of the Milford Dam, the building of the Headquarters Road Dam, establishing a new irrigation area through there - just as the member for New England would be aware of the work we have done in augmenting the Chaffey Dam. Where you have the correct location and where you have the right proposal, there are occasions where the footprint of dams can be increased, done in a way that works and done in a way that is environmentally responsible.                 When I read Simon Benson's article today, I saw something that was not economically, environmentally or in any way responsible, but I will congratulate whoever wrote this document for breathtaking logic. What they have proposed in that document, and what government policy absolutely rejects, is that you can use your dams in this magical way so that they will provide against drought, provide against flood and provide renewable energy. If you are managing a dam to avoid drought, your dam has to be constantly full; if you are managing a dam to avoid flood, you need to keep your dam empty; and if you are managing your dam to be able to provide hydroelectricity, you need to keep the dam flowing. Only the opposition could come up with a dam policy where they have dams that will be always full, always empty and always flowing! But that is what they have decided to release.                 Let us not forget what happened the last time there were major dam proposals in Australia. When the Traveston Dam was proposed, who was it who was there, in this parliament, and on the site, campaigning against the building of the Traveston Dam? It just may well have been the Leader of the National Party, there, in the front line, saying all the reasons why it was so bad to build a new dam. I thought, well, maybe there has been an occasion where the opposition have had a rethink and they want to ditch their old view on this and move forward. I had a look at whether they have been out there in social media arguing in favour of the policy today.                 The opposition leader has not touched it. The shadow minister for the environment did something about Gotye last night; he has not gone near the policy today. But the member for Paterson did decide to comment on the policy today. His tweet was to tell us that under no circumstances will there be a Tillegra Dam. The one thing they are willing to back is the old-style opposition to dams, which they have always followed. They have a policy that they have now put out and that they want to run a million miles away from, because they know when you promise everything to everyone in every contradictory fashion, it is a policy that cannot work.

  I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for that question. It is not unusual that there are deductions provided for in a tax such as this. It is the case that there is a starting base allowance. It is a deduction which recognises past investment.                 If I am hearing her right, what she is saying is that there should not be a starting base for the MRRT. I think that would come as a very rude shock to industry right across the country, because it would be a deeply irresponsible policy position to hold. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has now referred to numbers that she says have been put in by some of the large mining companies. It may come as news to her, but these numbers were actually published last August by the companies themselves. Somehow, this is news today.                 The fact is, because of confidentiality provisions of the act, I am not privy to which particular companies are paying the MRRT. But I have made it very clear, as has the Assistant Treasurer, that we do need to see greater transparency in our corporate tax system and in particular when it comes to the MRRT. The government will do everything we possibly can to ensure there is maximum transparency. But for her to try to say that on the basis of six months she can draw a conclusion about the impact of the starting base vis-a-vis the impact of the dollar, vis-a-vis the impact of commodity prices, is simply stupid.

  I thank my friend the member for Moreton not only for the question but for his interest in the development and implementation of a complex sophisticated document, the white paper on Australia in the Asian Century, that sets out 25 pathways and objectives, and policies to achieve those objectives.                 Developing responsible, well-considered policy is vitally important, and the Australian people expect it. I am asked about alternative approaches and there are, of course, alternative approaches. There was an alternative approach last week. We heard from the coalition that they want to move the people north. This week they want to move the water south. I guess that people will pass the water, the water will be coming down, the people will be going up and confusion will reign supreme.                 In the last week we have heard stories of water, dams, ships, canals and leaks. Certainly that policy unit is leaking. It is a pipeline of leaks to the media as they test their wacky propositions. We heard from the minister for water just now about the confusion of water heights: whether they should be high, whether they should be low or whether they should be moving.                     Dr EMERSON:                     Speaker, I was asked about alternative approaches to the responsible approach that this government is implementing. As the water minister just indicated, there is confusion about the height of dams.                     Dr EMERSON:                     The dam heights, according to the coalition, should be high, they should be low and they should be moving. It is a case no doubt of damned if you do, dammed if you do not. The big question here - and it is a question of the shadow finance minister - is: where will the money come from? The distressing news is that the Leader of the Opposition has appointed none other than Senator Barnaby Joyce to arrange the financing. This is the guy he dumped as the shadow finance minister because Senator Barnaby Joyce kept getting mixed up between his millions, trillions and gazillions. And now he is back designing the superannuation arrangements, raiding superannuation funds and instructing people who manage the superannuation of the working men and women of Australia to invest in uneconomic projects.                 The people of Australia who invest their superannuation funds deserve and expect a decent return. They do not get that, of course; the Leader of the Opposition - himself described by the then Treasurer, Peter Costello, as economically illiterate - has now got Senator Joyce, who is also economically illiterate. This team is economically illiterate in seven languages, and they should be ashamed of themselves.

  It is simply too silly for words. We are the 12th largest economy, but when it comes to population we rank 51. So now we are going to go on and he is going to argue that the rate of growth in employment in Germany, or wherever else he was quoting, is somehow larger - he wants to compare a developing economy to a developed economy. He wants to mix up all of these apples, pears and oranges and then try and get a valid comparison. You cannot do it.                 Everyone on this side of the House is absolutely proud of the job creation performance of our country. It reflects the hard work of millions of Australians and people in business who have really put their nose to the grindstone in the most difficult of global conditions - so much so, that we did not go into recession during the global financial crisis and the global recession. Through that we grew, almost alone amongst developed economies. All the other developed economies went into recession. We stand here with an unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent. Just go around all of the other developed economies in the G20 and then go around the rest. This is an outstanding performance. And because we did not experience the massive increase in unemployment that occurred in many other developed economies it would be the case that our employment growth as a percentage would be smaller than that witnessed in other economies where unemployment had been far higher because of the global recession. These are just facts.                 We know that those opposite are in deep denial about the most basic of economic facts. And because they are in deep denial about the most basic of economic facts they are a danger to our country, because they do not understand the basics of economic growth and job creation. They do not understand why it is important to have good fiscal policy. They do not understand why it is important to support an economy when there is danger in the global economy. They understand none of these things. They run around our country and talk our economy down every day. They exaggerate debt levels. They make untrue statements. They talk the economy down and the consequence is they are unfit to run a $1.5 trillion economy.

  I thank the member for Lyons for his question. Indeed, just before Christmas the government opened the largest-ever road project in Tasmania, the Brighton Bypass. Work is continuing on the $200 million revitalisation of the Tasmanian freight rail network to take trucks off the road and put freight onto rail. Our Nation Building Program is fully costed, fully funded and is being delivered.                 I am asked about other proposals, and in Tasmania there have been some other proposals recently. The Leader of the Opposition went to Tasmania just a couple of weeks ago and repeated his promise that they would fully duplicate the Midland Highway. He was asked how much money they had, and he said, '$400 million'. He was asked where he got that from and he said he had had informal discussions with road engineers. Unfortunately, it is a $2.7 billion project. His was done on the back of an envelope, and indeed I am advised that $400 million will not get you from Brighton to the Mood Food servo in Kempton. Perhaps that is where he did the maths for this project?                 But then when it came up in Senate estimates yesterday, having gone from being fully-funded, Senator Eric Abetz now says that a Liberal government would assist with the upgrading, and that it was always going to be a combined project. This commitment did not last two weeks. It is not surprising. Last week we began construction on the Majura Parkway and we also began construction on the WA Gateway project in Perth, the biggest road project ever in Western Australia. In 2010 those opposite said they would give it consideration for some time after 2014-15. It did not appear in their forwards and did not appear in their costings. Construction is now underway as a result of the funding, as a result of real money being delivered. They go and bag our progress, but they are happy to turn up. In this photo, there is myself, Smithy, the member for Perth, the proud local member. And there is the member for Swan. Hard hat on -                      he has got the shovel out and he is in front of the government's federal Nation Building Program sign. That is how you can identify him! They go out, they do not do their homework, they do not put in the costings and they do not provide proper funding.                     You just did not fund it - you just did not fund it! Nothing there in the budget! You said you would do it in the never-never.                 It is a bit like the Leader of the Opposition on the Pac Highway, where he said he would fund the Coffs Harbour bypass, and the local member had to say -

  Yes, I do think it is important and it is 5.4 per cent. I made a mistake, but the one thing I think we should all understand is this: keeping unemployment low and creating jobs requires strong economic growth, and everything this government has done has kept our economy strong and kept jobs growing; 5.4 is the envy of the world.

I am pleased to report to him and to the House that every day this week the Labor government have provided details about how we are delivering a fair go all around in Australian workplaces for employees and employers. We have been up-front, we have been positive and we have been future focused.                 On Monday, we announced that we intend to improve the right to request flexible arrangements. On Tuesday, we announced how we would assist victims of workplace bullying through amending the Fair Work Act. On Wednesday, we announced how we would create more flexibility for people taking unpaid parental leave. Today, I am pleased to tell the House that we are proposing specified policies to help protect workers against arbitrary changes to their rosters.                 The reason we are up-front, the reason we are positive and the reason we are future focused is that we know that work is a big part of the lives of modern Australian families. But we also know that Australian workers are not just decimal points on a profit-and-loss expenditure sheet. We understand that Australian workers are not just numbers or units to be kept in the dark. We know that Australians aspire to good jobs and workplaces which have a regular pay cheque and regular hours, where they have some control over the work they do, where they work for profitable and flexible enterprises. Australians are, therefore, interested in the workplace relations policies of the future, and they deserve better than they are receiving from the opposition. They deserve to hear how each side of politics will enhance their prospects in the workplace.                 Unfortunately, the opposition this week have not been up-front, they have not been positive and they are certainly not future focused. All we can find out about the opposition policies on workplace relations is that Liberal governments make bad bosses. Just ask 40,000 Victorian teachers today, who had Premier Baillieu break his promise to raise their pay and look after them. We do know that the opposition are notorious union baiters who would blame unions for everything in Australia and we know that they want to introduce a tax on the superannuation contributions of low-paid Australian workers.                 But what we do not know in workplace relations is whether they will guarantee penalty rates. We do not know if they will protect Australian workers' rosters. We do not know if they will stand up for existing public holidays. We do not know if they want to make unpaid parental leave more flexible. All that we can find out from the opposition is that they say they can be trusted on workplace relations - but, if they can be trusted, why hide their policies? If there is not going to be a repeat of what they did last time, why hide their policies? If they are not going to sink the boot into Australian workers, why hide their policies?                 What is most remarkable is that they can find locations for 100 dams in Australia but they cannot release a workplace relations policy. They say that they can build 100 dams, but they cannot release a workplace relations policy. Again, I issue the same challenge that I make each time I debate the opposition: show us -

  That is true. The member is referring to the forward estimates and they are very credible forward estimates. They are very credible forward estimates.                  The opposition here made this government wait nine months to put in place offshore processing on Nauru - nine months. The consequence of that has been more boats in the short term. But we are putting in place a response, via the Houston review, and that response is working. Of course, over time, as that response is put in place, the number of arrivals comes down. That is the fact of the matter. That is why we have worked so hard to get these arrangements in place and we would certainly appreciate from those opposite more cooperation on the regional arrangements so we can put in place more policies to restrict the flow of refugees to this country.

  I thank the member for Banks for his question. He has seen $83,277 million worth of project investment in his electorate. There have been over 100 projects improving schools right around the electorate of Banks because on this side of the House we do understand how important education is to a child's future, for the parents hopes for their child and also of course to the economy. On Tuesday, we had the extraordinary situation where the leader of opposition business, who is also the shadow minister for education, tried to stop the debate on the Australian Education Bill.                  It is an important bill that will provide the directions for the National Plan for School Improvement, locking in important reforms, higher teacher standards and giving every student quality learning opportunities and more power in the hands of school leaders. It was not surprising, I guess, that the member for Sturt wanted to lock out that debate given the decade of neglect that we had from those opposite on education: an unfair funding model, flagpoles instead of libraries, history wars instead of a national curriculum - who could forget that episode. He was possibly even concerned about the contributions from members on his own side, because actually some opposition members did talk about education reform. The member for Aston offered his thoughts on improved education outcomes, saying, 'Improve teacher training and lift teacher quality in schools, have a rigorous national curriculum, more school empowerment.' The member for Murray highlighted the current declining state -                      The members should listen to this answer because some of his own members have identified those priorities, as I am pointing out, with the member for Murray highlighting the declining state of educational opportunity in her rural electorate. The member for McPherson stated that it is the right of every child to receive a world-class education. Of course, the member for Bowman had already got in on the act by 'giving a Gonski', but there you go.                 It is obvious that these members have had a look at the National Plan for School Improvement. All of the elements are there: tick for excellence, tick for equity, tick for teacher quality, tick for a national curriculum, tick on school leadership, tick for the fact that country schools will be properly resourced under a National Plan for School Improvement. Now that just left the member for Sturt, and we do not often get to hear the member for Sturt speaking on education in here. But he clearly laid the coalition's intention on education: to stick to a broken funding system that is failing too many kids. His speech made it clear that for every parent in a small, one school regional town, or a low-income family who do not have any choice in the school they send their child to, the opposition and the member for Sturt believe that they should be having a model that leaves kids behind. We will deliver a model that supports kids for education.

  The first thing that I would say in response to that question that was put is that mum and dad would have a mortgage, and mum and dad would probably have an average mortgage of $300,000, which means they would be paying $5,000 a year less than they were paying when the Liberals were last in power out at Wanniassa - $5,000 a year. Why do mum and dad have a mortgage? They have a mortgage because they want to make a significant investment in the most important asset they could have in their lives. And of course they cannot pay for it all at once. They should not necessarily try to do that if they want to provide their family with the best standard of living. They want to be able to afford some education. They want to be able to afford some health. They want to make other investments as well. So they take a common-sense decision to take out a loan and support their family, and pay it off as quickly as they possibly can.                 The nation had a sudden and dramatic cut to its national income over the past five years. Suddenly, $160 billion went out the door. If you want to follow the logic of what the member is saying, what mum and dad should do in reaction to losing, say, $160,000 is sell the house and go and live in a tent. We say no to that kind of logic. What we did as a country was say: 'We should support our people. We should support mum and dad. We should keep mum and dad in jobs. We should ensure that their kids get the possible start in life. We should support our economy. We should get economic growth going.' Do you know what happens when economic growth gets going? You have a stronger budget. If you have more jobs, you have a stronger budget. Then you pay down your debt. That is what you do. And that is what mum and dad do, too.

  I thank the member for Kingston for her question. Unfortunately, it is a sad fact that every day millions of women are subjected to violence and physical abuse. V-Day in 2013 is highlighting the One Billion Rising campaign, a campaign that asks us to consider that one in three women will experience violence in their lifetimes. That is one billion women who are survivors of abuse. It is asking us to do something about it.                 In Australia, one in three women have experience physical violence and one in five sexual violence since the age of 15. We have a zero tolerance of violence against women, wherever it occurs. We are taking action in Australia, as well as overseas, in contributing to international efforts. Any act of violence against anyone is of course unacceptable. The cost to the Australian community of domestic violence in this country is more than $13 billion per annum.                 This government has committed $86 million to the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. Through the plan, we have already invested more than $30 million to help achieve these goals: $17 million on 'The Line', a social media campaign encouraging young people to develop respectful relationships; $9 million to fund respectful relationship projects in communities; $3 million for community action grants to groups and sporting organisations to engage at the local level; and $1 million to the White Ribbon Foundation to develop programs to support workplaces to tackle attitudes to violence against women. Our prevention measures have included recently establishing, with the states and territories, a national centre of excellence to guide and promote research on issues affecting women who experience violence. We have created 1800RESPECT, the first national telephone and online counselling support service for victims, their families, their friends and people who are working with them. We are providing free training through DV-alert for health and allied workers to improve their capacity to respond to women who are experiencing violence. We are improving services for women with disability.                 This year's session of the United Nations' Commission on the Status of Women, to be held in New York, has the priority theme of eliminating violence against women and their children. Internationally, Australia continues to support initiatives such as crisis services, counselling and legal support. Violence against women has no geographical, financial or cultural boundary. It is, regrettably, happening everywhere every day. On this day, I join, together with the House, the V-Day organisers in encouraging groups and individuals to demand an end to violence against women and to speak out against it each and every day that it occurs.

  I thank the member for that question. We on this side of the House understand that when you create prosperity you must spread opportunity. It is the case that there is lot mining investment in the pipeline. In that pipeline currently are $270 billion of projects that are committed to. We on this side of the House think that it is only fair that all Australians get a share of this boom - an investment boom that is going to become a production boom that is going to become an export boom.                 Because mining is concentrated in a couple of areas of the country, there are some special things that we should do for mining regions, such as the area that the member for Herbert comes from - such as all the investments that we are making in roads up in Townville, including ring-roads and so on, and such as what we are doing at the port. We think that the mining boom should fund some of that. It is like the Gateway project in Perth, which will assist all the mining companies.                 On the other hand, there are many other people who are not in the fast lane of this boom. They want a share of it, too. That is why we have been absolutely committed to supporting families and to assisting them with the cost of living through, for example, the schoolkids bonus. This is an enormous boon to Australian families who struggle to get through Christmas and kit out their kids when they go back to school - buying shoes and all the school books and so on. Those opposite want to take it away.                 The reason that they want to take it away is because those opposite have a $70 billion crater. What they want to do is take a sledgehammer to the Australian economy through a whole host of cuts. The first thing that is going to go is the schoolkids bonus. That will be gone under them. The second thing that is going to go under that mob is the tripling of the tax-free threshold. That will be gone under the Liberals. The third thing that is going to go is the assistance to superannuation for the lowest paid workers in our community. The up to $500 that they get will be gone under the Liberals. We believe that all Australians have a right to share in our prosperity through policies that give them jobs, access to affordable health and education, and assistance with the cost of living.

  I thank the member for Reid for his question, and I know of his very longstanding interest in this area. From this year, more than 50 national or subnational regions around the world will have a price on carbon pollution, covering around 1.1 billion people globally. Australia is responsibly playing its part. Our carbon price is already cutting dangerous carbon pollution to slow the devastating effects of climate change. Yesterday we saw President Obama again emphasising the importance of global action, calling on congress to bring in a carbon price. He said:                 I urge this Congress to get together to pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change -                  a market based solution to climate change -                  like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago. But if Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will.                 The McCain-Lieberman bill was an emissions trading scheme, a market based mechanism just like Australia's. Here we have this Leader of the Opposition claiming he is at one with President Obama on climate change. He said it on radio not two weeks ago - a soul mate, no less. This is yet another blow to the Leader of the Opposition and his catalogue of phoney claims, especially his ludicrous pretence that the world is not acting. He said:                 _ there is no sign, no sign whatsoever, that the rest of the world is going to do things like introduce carbon taxes or emissions trading schemes.                 No sign at all - except from China, Korea, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, South Africa, the United States and another 40-odd countries.                 This morning this Leader of the Opposition was at it again, ridiculously trying to claim that President Obama had ruled out an emissions trading scheme. Anyone who listened to the State of the Union address would know that that is just plain wrong. The Leader of the Opposition's rejection of sensible, serious, careful action on climate change goes against the wisdom of every living Liberal leader other than himself, against the wisdom of every leading scientist and economist, against the wisdom of prime ministers and presidents around the world, and against plain common sense.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, though I am a bit surprised that he would raise in this parliament cost-of-living pressures for the people of Western Sydney when the Leader of the Opposition has a plan to ensure that more than half a million people in Western Sydney pay more tax, that 115,000 families in Western Sydney lose their schoolkids bonus, that 240,000 pensioners lose pension increases, that 1.1 million people in Western Sydney lose their low-income superannuation contribution. And then, of course, the cuts go on because of what the Leader of the Opposition has planned for schools and for hospitals and also the attacks that he has got planned on small businesses, with 120,000 small businesses -                      I was asked a lengthy question including references to cost-of-living pressures in Western Sydney, and I am addressing that part of the question. Important for families in Western Sydney is the flow-through of lower interest rates to the burden that paying the household mortgage is for families in Western Sydney, with the average mortgage now costing them $5,000 less per year than it did when the Leader of the Opposition was a minister in government. So, for cost-of-living pressures for people in Western Sydney, we are very concerned.                 We understand that, though our nation has a resilient economy, for many families it can be very difficult to make ends meet, which is why we will keep working with families in Western Sydney and indeed around the nation: working to provide benefits like the schoolkids bonus; working to better support their childcare costs than they have ever been supported before; working to ensure that they continue to enjoy the benefit of tax cuts, with more than half a million people in Western Sydney having their tax cuts at risk as a result of the policies of the Leader of the Opposition; making sure that we help them at the time that a new baby is born, through paid parental leave both for mums and for dads, making sure that that special support is available; and, for those older citizens in Western Sydney, continuing to provide pensions at an increased level - indeed, having delivered a historic increase and then adding to it. So cost-of-living pressures for people in Western Sydney and around the nation are at the forefront of the government's policies and plans to work with modern families as they work their way through the stresses and strains of modern living.                 On government budget matters: the budget will be unveiled in May. I trust that, on the Thursday when the Leader of the Opposition replies, he will stop running for cover and hiding -                      and produce a complete set of figures.

  I thank the member for Fowler for his question. I thank him for the way in which he represents the communities within his electorate in this place, and I thank him for spending some time with me last week when I had the opportunity to spend a number of days in Western Sydney, something that I very much enjoyed. Whilst in Western Sydney I had the opportunity to meet with people in all sorts of settings from all walks of life, but one meeting actually reinforced in me very strongly the importance of the government's plan for the nation's future - the importance of our focus, our relentless focus, on ensuring we create jobs and bring opportunity to Australians around the nation, including in Western Sydney.                 I had the opportunity to meet with a young man called Corey Payne. He would be known to a number of Australians as a first grade NRL player -                      I am getting helped here. Yes, indeed - he played for the Bulldogs. So we are getting some supporters making sure that that is on the Hansard. Corey Payne has also engaged in getting a master's degree at Sydney university, and Corey Payne is running a charity that is there to inspire young people in Western Sydney - inspire them to be the first in their family to go on to higher education. In his company, I had the opportunity to meet Paolo and Elaine. Elaine and Paolo are both from Fairfield High School. Elaine, having studied there, is now enrolled at Sydney University. This is her first year and she is studying law. Paolo is still at Fairfield High School. He has set his sights on engineering at the University of New South Wales.                 Our national partnership money at Fairfield High School has worked with Corey Payne - his charity and his leadership - and the school's leadership to create new opportunities for these young Australians. Our national partnership money has facilitated the construction of a dedicated study area, now known to students at that school as the home of the 'nerd herd'. That is something that they wear as a badge of pride: they are students who are studying together with the dream and aspiration of being the first in their family to go to university. If you were trying to boil down into one life story the work of this government and the importance of our plan for Australia's future, it is this: making sure that young people, whether they are in Sydney's west or anywhere else around the nation, get the opportunity to have doors open to them, whether it is to university or to an apprenticeship or traineeship, so they can have the skills they need for their life. It is through that that we will be stronger, smarter and fairer nation. It was great to have some time to spend with these very impressive young Australians.

  I do thank the shadow Treasurer for that question. I think it is the case that we have seen in the national accounts that the Australian economy is robust and that the Australian economy is resilient. It is also the case that we have seen a very unique set of circumstances emerge - particularly on the revenue side of our budget. This unique set of circumstances is driven by a combination of events that we have not seen in the economic history of our country: on one hand, a declining terms of trade, and on the other hand, a very high dollar. The consequence of that has been that there is a challenge to our revenue. At the end of last year, I very clearly made the point to the Australia people that this government's priority would always be to support growth and to support jobs.                 I made that point at the end of last year very deliberately, because it would have been deeply irresponsible of this government to cut harder, to cut back on jobs and growth, in the face of what was a very significant revenue downturn. That was the consequence of a set of events in our economy that we have not seen ever before. We have now seen nominal GDP growth go below real GDP growth for three quarters in a row. The point that I want to make is this: this government will always put jobs and growth first.                     Certainly. It brings me to the point that we will always support our economy when there is a threat to jobs and growth. Last year in the budget, what I outlined was the forecast for a whole range of indicators - such as growth and debt. I made the point very clearly then and outlined that we would bring these figures in within the debt cap that I outlined in last year's budget - and that remains. But there is a very clear choice here, because those opposite want to spread fear about debt. There is no doubt about that when we as a country have done so much better than just about every other developed economy in the world, because our priority was to support jobs and growth in our economy. We were opposed every step of the way by those opposite. If they would have had their way back during the global financial crisis, deficits would have been higher and so too would have been debt. Now, we are challenged again. The proposition that they are putting to the people of Australia is that, in the face of a revenue slowdown that we have seen, they would cut harder and hit jobs and growth.                     We will always support jobs and growth within the context of our medium-term fiscal strategy.

  I thank the member for Moreton for that very important question. Last week we had the national accounts, and our economy grew by 0.6 per cent in the December quarter - 3.1 per cent through the year. This occurred at a time when the shadow Treasurer said that the economy was flatlining, and, of course, the Leader of the Opposition claimed that the economy was yet to grow. The fact is that this is a great result for Australia, whichever way you look at it. But those opposite want to continuously talk our economy down. The fact is that more than half of the advanced economies around the world did not grow during that quarter, and we grew faster than every other developed economy bar one. This gets us to the point where our economy is 13 per cent larger now than it was prior to the global financial crisis. We know that not everybody is immune from these conditions in the global economy and there are sectors and families in our economy that are doing it tough. As I was saying before, we can see this in the unusual combination of events that are playing out in our economy: dramatically declining terms of trade on the one hand and a dollar which is staying stubbornly high. What that is doing is putting a squeeze on profits and income right across our economy.                 The shadow Treasurer wants everybody to believe that that is not happening, that, just as there was not a global financial crisis, these events are not playing out in our economy right now. But the fact is that they are having a dramatic impact on government revenues. Government revenues are down $6 billion since MYEFO. That will have an impact on this year and years beyond - of that there is no doubt. When the global economy takes an axe to revenues, the commitment of this government is not to take an axe to jobs and growth. That is the proposition that has been put by those opposite. In the face of all this, they are saying, 'Take an axe to jobs and growth.' We on this side of the parliament would never, ever do that, because we are committed to jobs and growth and supporting Australian families in jobs.                 The Leader of the Opposition raised the question before of the cost of living. If you do not have a job, you cannot handle the cost of living. If the opposition had had their way during the global financial crisis, hundreds of thousands of Australians would be without jobs. Our policies during the global financial crisis supported growth and jobs, particularly for people in Western Sydney. We put Australian workers first. Those opposite always put them last.

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for that question. As I said before, we are putting in place our medium-term fiscal strategy and committed to surpluses, on average, over the economic cycle. That is the responsible thing to do. If the shadow Treasurer wants me to bring down the forecast for the May budget today, that simply cannot be done and he absolutely knows it. But what we on this side will give is a commitment to support jobs and growth. What we are seeing here very clearly today is a determination from those opposite to take an axe to our economy and to slash and burn, particularly across jobs, health and education. You get no clearer commitment to that than what the shadow Treasurer said in Western Sydney last week.                     The government makes no apology for putting jobs and growth first in the context of a medium-term fiscal strategy committed to surplus, on average, across the economic cycle.

  I thank the member for Kennedy for his question about a very important matter, and yes, I am aware of the issues that he has raised. This is a very serious matter and one that I know the member for Kennedy feels very strongly about, as I do. There is horrific damage being done in Indigenous communities as a result of alcohol abuse -                      It is also breathtaking that those opposite think that it is a joke - the level of violence and -                      I withdraw. I state again to the member for Kennedy and to those opposite that the level of violence endured by women and children in Aboriginal communities is the responsibility of each and every one of us. It is the responsibility of each and every one of us to make sure that they do not have to suffer in the way they have suffered day after day.                     It is a very important issue and, of course, the Queensland government has recently opened up the question of alcohol management plans. This issue is open to very significant debate in Queensland. In fact, I met with the Queensland Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and Multicultural Affairs just this morning. We talked about these issues and I made the point very clearly to him - and I will make it to the parliament today - that our priority is to make sure we reduce harm. That is what we are on about. That is the priority of this government - to make sure that Aboriginal women and children living in remote communities will no longer be subject to the level of alcohol induced violence that they have been subject to. That is our priority and it will continue to be so.

  I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and his interest in 457 visas. The government supports the current arrangements where we have two-thirds of the permanent stream used for skilled migrants. That is a good thing and should continue. We support limited work rights for students and holiday makers and we support the legitimate use of 457s where there is a genuine skills shortage. However, there has been advice provided to me, as it was to my predecessor, that there are problems with the 457 scheme.                 The first concern is the large gap between the 457 growth rate and the total employment growth rate. This is illustrated by a 68 per cent increase in 457s for workers in the information, communications and technology sector between 2008-09 and 2011-12. At the same time as this very significant rise in the applications that were granted we have seen nominal wage rates in these positions fall by five per cent for information professions and 12 per cent in technical professions. This is the nominal fall in the rate, so the real wage rate fall is even more dramatic than that.                  The positions for those 457 applicants now have lower wage rates than jobs that are currently filled by the permanent workforce in that sector. This is of deep concern to the government and it should be a concern for those opposite. That is why we need these reforms. We need to ensure that employers demonstrate a genuine need for 457 applicants. We need to ensure we demonstrate that they sought to employ local workers. We need to ensure that we show a genuine commitment to training local workers. For that reason, we need these reforms.                 The opposition leader has said that he opposes these reforms. In fact, he said that he wants the 457 scheme to be the mainstay of immigration. The member for Cook, in a speech to the AMMA conference last August, said he wanted to remove the blockages and restore the access to 457s - that is, bring it back to the days of the Howard government. He went on further to say:                 While this process works for those who can sponsor, I am concerned there is no real pathway for skilled migrants to come independently to Australia on a temporary labour visa, seek employment on arrival _                 That is what he wants to do - radically depart from the current 457 scheme. That will have a fundamental adverse impact on employment conditions in this country.

  To the member's question: when we first were elected to government, we inherited from the former government a 457 visa program that was out of control - out of control. And the Leader of the Opposition has, as his policy, endorsed that same out-of-control approach for the future.                    An incident having occurred in the gallery -                    An incident having occurred in the gallery -                    An incident having occurred in the gallery -                      I was asked about 457 visas and I was starting by making the point that we inherited a system from those opposite that was out of control. Of course, a key difference between our policies and plans for the nation's future and the Leader of the Opposition's policies and plans is that we believe Australians should go first and we want to ensure, at every stage, that the visa system works to put Australians first. The Leader of the Opposition has a different approach and wants to make 457 visas a mainstay of the immigration system. So there is a clear policy difference and people can judge.                  In terms of the data that has concerned me about 457 visa holders, 457 visa holders currently are at more than 100,000. This represents a 21.5 per cent increase compared to February in 2012. Having cracked down on this system once, those kinds of statistics do concern me and I believe it is time to crack down on this system again.                  As the minister for immigration has also made clear, I am concerned about the double whammy which comes when you have state Liberal governments which are cutting back access to training, undercutting our apprenticeship system, slamming the door in the face of young Australians who would seek to get skills, and then making representations to the federal government: 'Don't worry about those training places; don't worry about those apprenticeships for young Australians; don't worry about that access to opportunity. Could you assist us by expanding the short-term visa program for part of the state?' Well, no, that is not good enough, and it will never be good enough for training cutbacks to be used as a justification for then bringing in more people from overseas.                  We should always make sure that we are putting Australians first through a world-class training system. We should always make sure we are putting Australians first in access to jobs and opportunity. That is what guides this government in our policies and it always will.

  I want to thank the member for Page for the question and acknowledge the advocacy of both the member for Page and the member for Richmond in their concerns about various proposals in the Northern Rivers area. This is an issue which has been raised by many members on this side and also very prominently by a number of members of the crossbench.                  When a federal approval is given over a large coalmine or a coal seam gas project, the public expectation is that we have taken into account every possible impact on what it could mean for water, whether it be underground water or whether it be its connection to surface water. The reality of environmental approvals at the moment is, legally, an environment minister is not able to take all those issues into account. They are only able to take them into account to the extent to which there might be an endangered species downstream or to the extent to which, for example, there might be a Ramsar wetland downstream, and that is the knock-on effect. But the broad based, taking into account the full impact on a water resource, is something where the public expectation is that that is exactly what we do. The legal requirement falls far short of that.                  We bridged the gap a fair way a year ago when I introduced legislation into this parliament which established the independent expert scientific committee. That made sure that the scientific work was being done to fully take into account all the potential impacts on water of these sorts of projects. Notwithstanding the work being done, it still fell short when you got to the approval process. We had data there that was not then able to be taken into account when we got to the decision at the federal level.                  For that reason, I announced earlier today that the government will be introducing amendments to national environmental law and, in those amendments, we will be establishing a water trigger as one of the matters of national environmental significance. We obviously want to make sure that we are only hitting the very large water issues. We do not want to create a problem for anyone who wants to put in a farm dam or anything like that. For that reason, the same window that applies to the independent expert scientific committee will apply to this new matter of national environmental significance. That will be coal seam gas projects and large-scale coalmines. In doing this, we will then be able to make sure that the community expectation of what is taken into account and the work that we fund to be independently assessed are taken into account when it gets to the decision-making time. In transition processes, we are also making sure that projects that are already within the system do not have to go right back to the start on their environmental approval process. Simply going through the normal process of seeking additional information will make sure that we have a streamlined approach that does not add significantly to time lines for businesses that have already commenced.                 Against all of this, we should be able to meet the actual community expectation: an approvals process where the rigorous work is done to make sure that all the data is taken into account for the impacts on underground and surface water and at the same time making that part of the decision.

  I thank the member for Chifley for his question. Indeed, I was with the member for Chifley and other Western Sydney members with the Prime Minister last week when we announced our commitment to help build the M5 and M4 extensions. We want to work with the New South Wales government to achieve real improvements to Sydney's motorways. The current New South Wales proposal has a number of weaknesses in it, and we are insisting that they be fixed. That is the way you do good infrastructure development: get your business plan in place first and then get your funding commitments made.                 The three commitments that we have made are these: (1) that the M4 has to take people into the city, (2) that the M5 has to take freight to the port and (3) that you cannot have new tolls on old roads.                     That is a common-sense position that people in Western Sydney understand. That is why we have contributed $25 million, announced in last year's budget, to enable the business case to be developed: because it is very clear that we need to get the planning in the project right first time, in order to ensure there is proper use of taxpayers' funds.                 Premier O'Farrell has a bit more work to do. First he said the city connection would go to Camperdown. Next he said, in an op-ed in today's Daily Telegraph, that the city connection would go only as far as Petersham. Next week it might be Ashfield. One thing I do know is that Camperdown and Petersham are not in the city. I do know that taking a freight connection to the side of Sydney airport closest to St Peters does not get freight to the port. King Street, Newtown, is not a thoroughfare; it is a roadblock. Unless we get this right the first time, it will simply fail.                 I notice that the Liberal candidate for Lindsay took out a full-page ad last week -                      saying that the M4 East Extension will complete the missing link between Western Sydney and the city. She quotes the Leader of the Opposition supporting our policy. And yet, last week when asked whether it was a condition, he was not sure: it was; it was not; it was; it was not. He needs to come clean to the people of Western Sydney. They cannot have it both ways. You cannot have Premier O'Farrell saying, 'We're going to build a road to Petersham with federal money,' and have this Leader of the Opposition pretending that this road is going to take people into the city. He indeed has described his own commitment, which he has made in these advertisements, as being an impossible condition for federal funds.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. As I say, this is a very important area and it is very important that we have a public debate on it. As I have been advised by the department - and that advice was affirmed by the Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration - we need to attend to the rorts. Quite simply, you either support the reforms or you support the rorts.                     What we have needed to do, as I have said, is to make sure we have enforceable provisions. The problems with some of the arrangements is that they are not enforceable and I have made very clear already - well before today - that we would be looking at the ways in which those provisions will be enforced. I have said that we will be looking at that. If the member for Cook actually followed some of the commentary, he would know that I have made it very clear that not only are we going to bring about the reforms  but also we are going to put in place the measures to ensure that those provisions are enforced.                 Leave not granted.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. Yesterday the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth and I were at the very impressive Macarthur Girls High School in Parramatta to announce our reforms to the quality of teacher training in Australia. Across Australia we have many thousands of dedicated and talented teachers, but, of course, we want to make sure we have the best possible teacher training in place for the future. That is why yesterday we announced the introduction of new, more rigorous standards for teacher training courses - to improve the quality of teachers graduating from universities in Australia. We want to improve the quality of our university teaching courses to make sure teachers have the required skills to be effective teachers, role models and leaders of our future generations. The four elements of the plan that the minister for school education and I announced yesterday are: more rigorous and targeted processes for admission into teaching courses; new literacy and numeracy tests that each student wanting to teach in Australia will need to pass before they are allowed to teach to ensure that they are in the top 30 per cent of literacy and numeracy; a national approach to teacher pracs so that teachers have the best possible classroom experience before they are admitted to teaching; and a review of teaching courses by the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency.                  These measures will be implemented in close consultation with Universities Australia and with independent, individual universities. I am pleased with the strong support from universities that has been given to this plan. Universities have also made it clear that they oppose the announcements made recently by the New South Wales government in this space. Universities recognise that, while an ATAR or a HSC result is an important indicator of somebody's ability, it is not the only indicator. There is more that goes into determining a good teacher - including passion, commitment, empathy and a dedication to education. So, I do welcome the support of Universities Australia, the New South Wales Vice-Chancellors Group and the Australian Council of Deans of Education, who have all backed the announcements made by Minister Garrett and me yesterday.                  We know that teachers can and do move between states and jurisdictions, and so a national approach is important. We also know that an ATAR cut-off is not the best indicator of who can be a great teacher. The New South Wales government's plans would be a retrograde step. But the measures we announced yesterday are not a retrograde step. They are a positive and forward approach, which ensures that our teachers will continue to be dedicated, committed and amongst the best trained in the world.

  I remind the Leader of the Opposition that this government has brought to the parliament proposals to help us deal with the circumstances of asylum seekers and people who arrive by boat, and the Leader of the Opposition in his reckless negativity has not supported those proposals. The Leader of the Opposition cannot come into this place and mount this kind of criticism when he has refused to accept the advice of the former Chief of the Defence Force, Angus Houston, he has refused to accept the advice of refugee expert Paris Aristotle, he has refused -                      I can confirm that we would have seen fewer boat arrivals but for the Leader of the Opposition's reckless negativity.

  I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question and his ongoing interest in looking after Australian workers. This government will always support Australian workers in jobs and training. Although the 457 visa is often used legitimately, there is clear evidence that in some industries and occupations the 457 visa scheme is not working as intended. Too many 457 sponsors are doing the wrong thing. Two examples will help illustrate that. First, in the IT industry, it is clear that some 457 sponsors are using the scheme to undercut wages and conditions, in effect denying young Australians the opportunity to compete for entry level graduate programming and computing jobs. Second, in hospitality, it is worrying that at a time when vacancies for cooks nationwide are falling, the occupation of cook is becoming the most popular application job. That is a disturbing trend.                  The government's approach to this is very straightforward. To get jobs you need skills, and to get skills you need training. That is why the government will expect employers to take seriously the obligation to train. The government is concerned that some users of the 457 scheme, instead of training Australian workers to fill positions, just buy those skills from overseas. Of course, that reflects the approach of the opposition, with state governments taking money out of training and cutting TAFE. 'No problem,' they say. 'We'll just get the skills from overseas.' That is not acceptable. The approach of the opposition to 457s is just Work Choices by another name - and it smells the same too! 'Just let the market rip, and don't worry about how unfair it is on Australian workers.'                 In future, employers' access to the 457 program will come with an obligation to make a serious commitment to training their own workers, to training Australian workers, and the government will rigorously enforce -                      this obligation to train.                     The contrast of this policy with the position of the opposition could not be any clearer. The Leader of the Opposition has said he wants the 457 scheme to be the mainstay of immigration. The member for Cook has said in a speech to AMMA:                 At current levels of temporary labour migration under the 457 programme there is room for expansion.                     What the opposition is looking to do here is to have an unfettered and expanded scheme to ensure that -                      In the same speech, the member for Cook said to the AMMA conference:                 _ it is essential we consolidate the role of 457s and look to restore access that has been taken away for these visas _ and remove some of the blockages to 457s _                 That is an unfettered approach that will deny Australian workers the chance of getting a job.

  The Leader of the Opposition may not be aware, but forward estimates are worked on by the public sector professionals at Treasury and the department of finance. I am not surprised the Leader of the Opposition is not aware of these questions, because the former Treasurer, Peter Costello, never let him anywhere near the budget process because he was well aware that the Leader of the Opposition was simply not up to the task -                      But the Leader of the Opposition ought to inform himself of the way the government's budget works and the way in which projections are done. If the Leader of the Opposition is genuinely concerned about this question, then he may want to stop the reckless negativity that has prevented him from joining with the government to fully implement the work of the Angus Houston report - that is, the former Chief of the Defence Force, aided by other experts including Paris Aristotle and Michael L'Estrange, respected experts. But of course the Leader of the Opposition did not want to accept an expert report that did not equate with his prejudices. The government will continue to deal with the facts, and we will continue to deal with the fact that in this parliament the Leader of the Opposition's reckless negativity means more boats.

  I thank the member for Corangamite, because supporting and creating jobs is the key priority of Labor in government. Since we came to power in 2007, 800,000 jobs have been created. Given the prolonged period of the global financial crisis, that is a truly remarkable achievement in our economy. The economy is growing at 3.1 per cent, inflation is contained, unemployment is only at 5.4 per cent, there is a new measure of stronger consumer confidence that is out today, and there is a massive pipeline of private sector investment. The economic circumstances are strong under this government's management.                 But of course there are some parts of the economy that are feeling some pressures from the effect of the high value of the Australian dollar and other structural changes, and that is why the government takes action to support and create jobs. That is why we have put in place a $5.4 billion new car plan, supporting 250,000 jobs related to the automotive sector. That is why we have provided support to Vodafone, which is bringing 750 jobs back from India to Tasmania - very important for the Tasmanian economy. And that is why the government is investing $1 billion also to grow jobs through our Plan for Australian Jobs announced just several weeks ago. That plan is in three parts. Firstly, it backs Australian businesses to win more work from large projects in our economy worth more than $500 million in areas like mining and other parts of the economy like infrastructure. Secondly, the plan sets up industry innovation precincts which will drive the innovation and investment that is needed to win new business in export markets. It will bring together the best minds in our research sector with businesses that have the capability and innovative drive to create jobs that are in export focused industries. Thirdly, the plan helps small- and medium-sized businesses to grow and create new jobs. That is the heartland of job creation.                 It is a comprehensive package that resulted from extensive consultation with industry, has been supported by industry, has been led by industry with the government - and the Australian Industry Group in the manufacturing sector of course has been a key part of that. But there are definitely impediments to these plans and definitely impediments to the creation of jobs in the Australian economy. Those impediments sit on the other side of the chamber. No-one loves it more when a business unfortunately announces some job losses than those on the other side. They are straight out there gloating about the loss of jobs. They never say anything when a coalition state government starts axing thousands of jobs, but they get right out there when business has to lay someone off. They will not support jobs in the Australian economy, but this government will.

  I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest in what is, of course, a very important centre and indeed something that is being implemented as a result of the recommendations of the Houston panel. This is a very important centre, and I think it is important to note that we engaged fully with the government of PNG to establish a memorandum of understanding to ensure that we could provide a deterrence for people who get on unseaworthy vessels. These centres, both the one in Nauru and the one in Manus Province, are important as part of the combination of reforms that are required to deter people from endangering their lives at sea. I managed to visit the facility some weeks ago - and, I understand, I was followed not long after that by the member for Cook - to see whether in fact the temporary facility was operating effectively - and it was operating effectively. I met with all of the service providers who are doing a good job in what are challenging circumstances, and indeed I met with the transferees themselves. I gave them a very, very clear message that of course they will be treated well, but we are going to ensure that the no-advantage principle as recommended by the Houston panel is realised.                     I am happy to do that. This centre is very important, as I say, in ensuring we provide a deterrence to people getting on unseaworthy vessels.                     I do not know why it is funny when I am talking about people dying at sea. I met with the minister for immigration, who is also the minister for foreign affairs, when I was in PNG, and I made it very clear that we will work together to ensure that transferees are going into the centre appropriately. What we have done to date is transfer people into that centre, which I believe and the government believes will deter people from getting on unseaworthy vessels. We will continue to work with the PNG government. It is the host country and, indeed, the primary government making decisions in relation to these transferees. I can assure you of this: we will continue to transfer people in consultation with and, ultimately, by the authority of the PNG government to ensure that there are fewer opportunities for and chances of people endangering their lives at sea. We will continue to do that not only in Manus Province but also in Nauru.

  I thank the member for Denison for his question. I can absolutely affirm to the member for Denison that we support the principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation - a dreadful three-word term, I know. But what it means is that states like Tasmania get distributions to them out of the GST pool, because states like Tasmania, with a limited economic base and tending to have a more disadvantaged population, need more resources at their disposal in order to equitably provide services like health and education. The horizontal fiscal equalisation principle is there so that, no matter where you live in this great country of ours, whether it is in Tasmania or the heart of Sydney's CBD, you have the ability to access services of an equal standard. That would not be possible unless there was that distribution to states like Tasmania, and we absolutely endorse that and stand by it. And I can verify that all of my Tasmanian colleagues - the member for Bass, the member for Braddon, the member for Franklin and the member for Lyons - are making that crystal clear to their communities. I can absolutely assure the member of that.                 I can understand why he is concerned about this matter, because the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition are on the public record endorsing in various ways the claims of Liberal premiers that there should be a per capita distribution of GST. If that were to occur, Tasmania would lose at least $600 million from its budget. That is the equivalent of Tasmania losing $1,200 for every man, woman and child in the state of Tasmania. That is obviously a reduction in support that the Tasmanian community could not withstand, but that appears to be the policy of the Leader of the Opposition from his public statements: take $600 million out of Tasmania and reduce services to the amount of $1,200 per man, woman and child. And that is before you get to the very direct cutbacks that the Leader of the Opposition has publicly announced, like cutting away the schoolkids bonus, taking away the benefits of the tax-free threshold, cutting into schools -                      cutting into trade training centres, health care and the like. I can understand the member's concern. The people of Tasmania are concerned. We, of course, will continue to support the people of Tasmania. It is a very good question for the Leader of the Opposition, and one he cannot give the same answer to.

  I thank the member for Bass for his question and I thank him for his genuine concern about the quality of schools in his electorate, and that means he is not only genuinely concerned about the welfare and opportunity of children in his electorate -                      but he is genuinely concerned, too, about the long-term future of Tasmania and of the Australian economy, because we cannot be a high-skill, high-wage economy in the future if our schools slip behind the standards of the world. That is why I am very determined that we engage in a national plan for school improvement and we deliver more resources to schools so that our schools are in the top five in the world - that is, our kids are getting a world-class education today so we can be the strongest and most prosperous economy tomorrow.                 Today it was my very great pleasure, on what is a good day for Australian education, to launch this year's edition of My School. My School has now come out for the fifth time, and every time more information is added so that parents, teachers and the Australian community can have more information about the performance of Australian schools than ever before. As education minister, I set our nation on this journey because I was disgusted, when I first became minister for education, to find out that there was nowhere you could go in the Australian nation to get a list of the most disadvantaged schools in the country. There was nowhere you could go to get a list of the highest performing schools. No-one under the former government had ever paid any regard to the quality of education or bothered to ask themselves the questions: 'Who needs the most help? What is going on in Australian schools?' That never happened - not once. Wilful neglect and cuts were the Liberal legacy in education.                 We have changed that. And what we can show today with My School is not only more information for parents than ever before; we can show the performance of our national partnerships and our new resources for school education. We can show that they are making a difference. We can show, for example, that the schools in our National Partnership on Literacy and Numeracy are improving at a faster rate than other schools. Seventy-one per cent reduced the number of students below minimum standards in year 3, and 70 per cent reduced the number of students below minimum standards in year 5 numeracy. That is a better education for kids, a better opportunity for life. That is the Labor way when it comes to giving children access to a great education, because we want all of them in the future to share in the life of our nation, and we do not want to see any child left behind.

  I thank the member for Wentworth for his question and I understand its motivations. I understand that the opposition have decided to seek some political advantage by bandwagoning with media interests and media organisations, transparent - and bordering on the laughable - as that is. Yes, it is.                     I am glad the opposition have the good grace to laugh when their motivations on this matter are transparently exposed. To the member for Wentworth I would say this: before we get into any sanctimonious nonsense about freedom of speech, it was under the Howard government that two journalists -                      Yes - this is the kind of hypocrisy that we see from the opposition. It was under the Howard government that two News Limited journalists faced jail for contempt of court. The reaction of the Howard government: do nothing. The reaction of this government: provide journalist shield laws. It was under the Howard government that churches would have their grants taken away - their services smashed - if they spoke out against government policy.                     I beg to differ. I think churches and charities being able to speak out freely is important to freedom of speech - and we have ensured it can happen. We have taken away the gag clauses that the Howard government had to stop churches and charities ever questioning an aspect of government policy. So maybe the member for Wentworth, who has been out today talking about freedom of speech, should take a look in the mirror and at the record of those opposite on these questions. The government's reform agenda has been misrepresented by the member for Wentworth in his question - completely misrepresented.                     Spycatcher was a long time ago. And those gag clauses are far more recent, as well as that threat to jail journalists. Coming back to the member for Wentworth's question, the member for Wentworth has completely misrepresented the nature of the government's reforms. What is being discussed here - and proposed to the parliament - is better self-regulation through an independent public interest media advocate. I would ask the member for Wentworth: why does he think that an appropriate self-regulation for our media should not occur? Why doesn't he think that? I am not going to be drawn on examples because it is inappropriate for me to do so -                      because this is not about my view; this is not about the view of politicians. This is about a system of better self-regulation which would mean, of course, that we see a functioning press council, or press councils, self-regulating the media. I think that is appropriate and certainly in line with the best of freedom of speech.

  I thank the member for Fraser for his question and for his longstanding interest in education policy and reform. We on this side of the House understand that investing in education is investing in the nation's future, and we understand that investing in students' education gives them the opportunity for good jobs in the future. And that is why it was great to be with the Prime Minister at Latham Primary School today to launch My School 2013 - and congratulations to that school on their very good year 5 results.                 My School is a powerful tool that provides a more complete picture of school and student progress and, importantly for us here, helps us learn what works in schools. So five years on, five million hits later, this website is providing more information than ever before. Five years on, we also know that the investments we have made in national partnerships in literacy and numeracy and for low socioeconomic community schools are also improving results. That is what we discovered today.                 In the National Partnership on Literacy and Numeracy we have been more successful in reducing the percentage of students at or below minimum standards at all schools in Australia. In the National Partnership for Low Socio-economic Status School Communities, we have seen improvements for Indigenous students, where education is a passport out of poverty.                 I am asked about success stories. There are plenty of them, but I was struck by an article in the Age about Sunshine North Primary School, where many students come to school and struggle with reading and writing. The principal, Mr Ryan, was 'not an early convert to the NAPLAN student testing scheme' but he now sees it as 'a useful tool in pushing his staff and students to do better'. There, again, the results speak for themselves. In 2008, 53 per cent of students were at or below the national minimum standard for year 5 reading; in 2012 that had dropped to 32 per cent, an absolutely fantastic result. So we know that My School is important because it can drive focused and targeted investment and because it builds a good body of information for policy and education. Parents know it is important because they get more information. The Gonski report acknowledged it as a foundation for funding reform. In fact, it seems that the only person who does not support My School in this way is - surprise, surprise! - the member for Sturt, the shadow minister for education.                 Class sizes do not matter to the member for Sturt. He wants to show one in seven teachers the door and now he wants to strip out the very NAPLAN results that I have spoken to today, cutting away crucial school-level information for parents, closing down the transparency that has provided the platform for school reforms. We are proud of My School. We are proud of the investment that we are making in schools to lift student results and we will commit ourselves to further education reform, in the interests of all Australians.

  As I said yesterday, and made very clear, we will update all of our estimates in the budget in the normal way. I also made the point really clearly that we outlined in MYEFO that our borrowings would be within the cap. I made that very clear. What this is about today is another attempt by those opposite to keep fear alive. Having seen their campaign against the carbon price completely bomb, they are now absolutely embarrassed by the fact that they are incapable of producing a respectable budget bottom line.                 We had another example of this today. We have this article from Phil Coorey, online, this morning. He says this: 'Senior sources predicted a month ago that it would not oppose legislation -                     The member for Wright then left the chamber.                     I was asked a question about debt, which goes to the core of fiscal policy and to the progress of fiscal policy over the forward estimates, and I do intend to address each element of the question. The fact is that we have a very strong fiscal policy on this side of the House. We are strongly controlling expenditure and we are doing that because we operate within a medium-term fiscal strategy committed to surpluses, on average, over the cycle. Those opposite claim that they are committed to that same goal, except what we have seen this morning is that this shadow Treasurer was rolled in the Liberal party room yesterday and he had his commitment to back vital legislation in this parliament - to put in place responsible fiscal policy - completely rolled in the party room yesterday. He was absolutely rolled. And rolled by who? The member for Menzies. Fair dinkum. If he got rolled by the member for Menzies he could be rolled by anybody.                     On this side of the House we are committed to a fiscal policy that will support jobs and growth. We are committed to publishing our estimates and forecasts twice yearly. Those opposite have not published a bottom line for five years. The last time they published one there was an $11 billion black hole at the heart of it. So what is very clear, in stark contrast to our side of the House -                      The shadow Treasurer admitted on breakfast television, sitting beside the minister for the environment, that he had a $70 billion hole in his budget bottom line. That has just been added to by $500 million, because he was rolled in the party room. On this side of the House we will put in place responsible fiscal policy to support jobs. On that side of the House, if they are to be taken seriously, they are going to have to slash and burn, particularly if they are not capable of facing up to the big decisions for the future.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for that question, because Australia has experienced 21 years of continuous growth. One of the reasons we have experienced 21 years of continuous growth - unlike any other developed economy - is that we have had governments that have had the foresight to put in the big reforms to create prosperity for the future. This government will not shirk from those big reforms and we will be going forward in the years ahead, putting in place fundamental reforms that will drive prosperity and productivity in our economy.                 The school improvement program being taken forward by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research is absolutely critical. None of these things can be done unless we keep our economy strong. We have quite a resilient economy. We have strong public finances. We have low net debt. These are things that other countries and finance ministers elsewhere in the developed world would give their right arm for. We understand the importance of strong growth within the framework of good fiscal policy, which is what we are putting in place every day. Every day we come into this House we ask ourselves, 'What can we do to make our country stronger, what can we do to make our country smarter and what can we do to make our country fairer?' We can keep our economy strong, we can make it smarter by investing in education and, of course, we can make it fairer. This government is committed to making a fairer Australia. You could not get a better example of that than our commitment to triple the tax-free threshold - that is, people on low incomes not having to pay a dollar of tax until their income gets to $18,200. That is an absolutely fundamental reform, not just in terms of fairness but also in lifting workforce participation. That reform is opposed by those opposite. Last week we had the debacle of the Leader of the Opposition and shadow Treasurer bumping into each other all over Sydney. The bottom line for what happened there is that they are going to take away a tax cut from seven million low-income Australians. That is the bottom line.                 We on this side of House understand cost-of-living pressures, the importance of a strong economy and the importance of making the country smarter and overall making the country fairer. That is what our program is directed to do. Those on the other side of the House stand for massive cuts to health and education, cuts which will hit growth, will push up unemployment and will push up deficit and debt. The contrast could not be clearer.

  Once again the Leader of the Opposition shows his ignorance of the basic workings of government and budgeting. Of course the government makes decisions about budgets - of course we do and we always will. We made a decision, for example, to treble the tax-free threshold. The Leader of the Opposition says no, that people should pay more tax. We made a decision to give a schoolkids bonus. The Leader of the Opposition says people should not get those benefits, and it goes on and on. The Leader of the Opposition ought also to be aware that as government's make decisions about priorities of the nation they work with public servants to generate and assist with budget estimates and budget forecasts. For example, no-one in the Howard government and certainly not the Leader of the Opposition puzzled through what expenditure Medicare would have if he made a certain decision about bulk-billing rates that was modelled for him. We work in the same way with our professional public servants. That is what my statement meant. It is self-evident to anybody who has the slightest regard for the way in which government works. Obviously the Leader of the Opposition does not.

  I thank the member for Shortland for the question. This morning I introduced five bills to round out the implementation of the $3.7 billion aged-care reform package Living Longer, Living Better. This legislation has been the subject of very detailed consultation with the sector and follows the delivery of a range of other commitments in the package: the design and release of new home care packages, consumer directed packages advertised last year and ready for delivery after 1 July this year; a determination by the new Aged Care Financing Authority about how providers will qualify for increased accommodation payments under this government's package and for a fairer and more transparent system of accommodation charging for consumers; the release and design of programs for increased dementia support; and better linkages between the aged-care system and our health system.                 Last week, I announced arrangements to begin to lift the wages of aged-care workers. We will need to triple the number of aged-care workers in this country over the next few decades, yet even today we struggle to recruit and to retain workers that we need.                     The most recent workforce census revealed that more than 60 per cent of aged-care facilities are short of registered nurses and 50 per cent of facilities are short of carers. Low wages in this sector are universally recognised as our key problem. The Productivity Commission recommended that we develop a funding system to underpin the payment of fair and competitive wages to those workers.                     National Seniors Australia advised us that, in a survey of their members, their members said that this issue was the most important question in aged care. The National Aged Care Alliance dealt with this issue explicitly in their blueprint for aged-care reform that they delivered to all parties in February 2012. On page 7, they said:                 _there is a need for:                  a bridging supplement for payment of fair and competitive wages for nurses, allied health professionals, personal carers and support staff;                 They called for:                 incorporation of the wage increases into a registered industrial agreement _                 This alliance is a very broad group and includes all of the major providers in the aged-care sector. I have always regarded their advice very highly.                 I am pleased to say that my announcement last week reflected that advice entirely. I table the blueprint for the assistance of House members. Most aged-care workers that I meet do not do this work for the money. They do it because they love it, but that has to stop being an excuse for paying such low wages for such important work.

  I thank the member for Moreton for his question, because I know of his long and passionate commitment to the arts, and his contribution to them, for that matter. This actually is a day of firsts, because this is the first question I have ever had on the arts. I cannot get one from the other side of the House. But the other first is that it is the first cultural policy this country has had for 18 years, and the last one was delivered by a Labor government too. In terms of the commitment to bipartisanship, we welcome it from the other side - but we never get the leadership, we never get the direction and we never get the ideas, and the big ideas, that demonstrate it.                 Today, Creative Australia has seen an injection of $235 million extra in support of the arts. Why is this government investment important? Firstly, governments have to invest in our culture and our creative industries. Why? - because culture defines us. We are home to the oldest living culture on earth, and we have been welcoming to the greatest diversity of cultures on earth. This is what has made us unique, and it is why we have to preserve it, nurture it, invest in it and build upon it.                  Secondly, if governments do make this investment there is a social dividend and an economic dividend. The social dividend is our values - values of inclusion and values of respect - which are the sorts of things that all of us want for our kids and all of us want for a healthy society. Investing in the arts pays dividends in that regard. But there is also an economic dividend, because a creative economy is also a more productive economy. In this day and age it is not enough simply to embrace technology unless we are consistently, creatively adding to it. Seeing the artist at the centre of a creative society and seeing a creative society central to our future as a nation is why this investment needs to be made.                  The final thing is that already in this economy there are 531,000 people employed in the creative industries - 531,000! This is close to five per cent of our workforce, and it is a sector, the growth of which is almost double that of the rest of the workforce. This is a growing industry. This is our future. Governments should invest in it, but it has taken another Labor government to do it. We ask the other side to get on side with us, because it is in the interests of the nation to do it.

  Thank you very much. To the member who asked the question: I actually do not think that Australians want to see us playing politics about sport in this parliament, particularly not at this time.                 What we have had is the professionals of the Australian Crime Commission deliver a report. We have had the professionals at the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority also dealing with this issue. From the perspective of the fans I can well and truly understand that fans who care passionately about their sport have watched this with a sense of anxiety. For fans of some clubs that have been out there publicly dealing with this issue there have been very difficult days indeed. I know what it is like to care passionately about a sporting club. But these things -                      Thank you very much. What is available to government, what is available to the opposition, and what is now available to members of the public through public statements, are insights into the work of the Australian Crime Commission and the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority. These are independent and expert agencies. I have nothing before me which would lead me to conclude that the findings and statements of these agencies publicly are anything other than correct. So the Australian Crime Commission has made a series of statements publicly. I have nothing before me which would suggest that those statements are not correct. I have nothing before me which would suggest that the public statements of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority are not correct. Those statements, of course, have caused reactions, understandably, and concern amongst fans. And it is important that these independent agencies get on with their work.                  What can government do? Government can make sure that, in particular, the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority, which now has a lot of work to do to deal with this matter, is appropriately resourced - and we have done so. We have received a request from them for more resources, and we have said yes to that. And if we receive further requests for more resources then of course they will be made available to assist them to get about this important work as expeditiously as it can be done.

  I thank the member for Reid very much for that question and for adding his voice to the chorus of Australians calling for the introduction of a national disability insurance scheme. I am very pleased that it is likely that the bill to establish the National Disability Insurance Scheme will go through the parliament - through both the House and the Senate - by the end of next week.                  This is a very important part of our plan to build a fairer Australia - an Australia that says that we do not think it is right for people with disability to be part of a cruel lottery that says that how much care and support you get depends on where you live or how you got your disability. One of the things that is very important in the legislation that is about to go through the parliament is that it will give the choice and control that people with disability are looking for, over the care and support that they need.                  The legislation will make sure that we are able to start the National Disability Insurance Scheme from July this year. It will start for little children across South Australia, and for adolescents and young people in Tasmania, and it will start in the area of Geelong - we have the members for Corio and Corangamite campaigning very hard for that - and also right across the Hunter.                  Here in the Australian Capital Territory, we will see the National Disability Insurance Scheme start in 2014, and I am very pleased to inform the House again that, as a result of the agreement between the Prime Minister and the New South Wales Premier, we now have a clear plan for the introduction of the full scheme of the National Disability Insurance Scheme right across New South Wales by 2018, something which people with disability and their families and carers are very, very pleased about.                 In addition to the National Disability Insurance Scheme, this government has also made sure that people with disability and carers have received significant improvements to their payments, and from 20 March, just next week, we will also see the next increase to both the disability support pension and the carer payment, of up to $35.80 a fortnight, a very important increase in the income support delivered by this government. This government is determined to do the right thing by people with disability and carers, delivering increased income support and the National Disability Insurance Scheme.

  I thank the member for his question. I remind the member, as I have reminded members on previous occasions, that the Australian Taxation Office is an independent statutory body. It is independent because I think all members would consider that it is entirely appropriate that it conduct its inquiries, investigations and any enforcement activity at arms length from government. The ATO, of course, takes a very close interest in matters that are in the public domain. Indeed, matters that are raised in this place will be looked at very closely, and no doubt the ATO will undertake whatever investigations flow from that. It is not appropriate for me to enter into a commentary on individual matters. If we were to go down that path then there are a whole range of individuals that might be closely aligned to those on the other side of the parliament that we could equally draw attention to. That is a matter that the ATO will consider. If there is anything for them to investigate, they will do that. If those opposite want to suggest that the law be changed to give the minister the power to instruct the ATO to start to pry into the affairs of individuals then let them come forward and make such a suggestion.

  I thank the member for Blair for the question. This morning I introduced the amendments that I referred to yesterday into the parliament, so they are now before the House, and I presume over the course of next week we will have the opportunity to debate them and work through them. They are exactly as I described yesterday, in that the window is a very tight window for the water trigger. It will only apply to those projects which are large coalmining operations or coal seam gas operations.                 As to the stakeholder response, I want to put very squarely a rejection of claims that have been put out by the National Farmers' Federation, where they have claimed that in some way a minister would be able to extend the new water trigger to have an impact on the ordinary operation of farmers. No farm dam, no irrigation operation, none of the ordinary operations of farmers, in any way is impacted by this. But, if a coalmining operation or a coal seam gas operation were to have a detrimental effect on the water resource then this would provide a very substantial protection for those farmers, which is why the New South Wales farmers have come out in favour and why the arguments which are being put forward by the National Farmers' Federation certainly do not in any way ring true and do not in any way match the concerns that their own constituents and membership have been putting on the ground for a very long time.                 A further stakeholder reaction, though - possibly one of the more hysterical stakeholder reactions - came from the Queensland Premier. Unsurprisingly, on every occasion when you do something in favour of the environment, the Queensland Premier stands opposed. Whether it is protection of koalas, protection of the Great Barrier Reef or protection of underground water, the reaction of the Queensland National Party is exactly the same every single time, even to the point where the Queensland Premier, when he took to Twitter getting all emotional about it, wanted to describe the new change as simply 'green tape'. Let me make it clear. Members of this side of the House, and indeed members of the crossbench, when we talk about protecting the Great Barrier Reef, do not see it as green tape. When we talk about protecting iconic species like the koala, we do not see it as green tape. When we talk about the impact on water resources, whether it be underground aquifers, whether it be surface water, it shows the height of environmental vandalism, instead of seeing the benefits of this - whether they be for our agriculture, for our wetlands, for our forests, for our rivers - to simply see it as nothing but green tape. It shows a complete lack of understanding of the importance of water - surface water, underground water - in a dry continent like ours.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I think it follows exactly a question asked to the Treasurer yesterday, which was answered yesterday. What I can say to the Leader of the Opposition, and what of course is always the backdrop to these questions from the Leader of the Opposition, is that the opposition fails to recognise that, as a result of the global financial crisis, as a result of circumstances in our economy, including the sustained high rate of the Australian dollar and the pressure it is putting on manufacturing, tourism and some other industry segments, we are seeing revenue write-downs.                 What the government will always do in these circumstances is focus on jobs. I had the opportunity a little earlier today to make a major statement about our focus on jobs, on putting the jobs and opportunities of Australians first - that is what we will always do.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question, and I know that she, unlike those opposite whose performance we have just seen, is genuinely concerned about the strength of our economy and the jobs and opportunities it offers working people and their families.                 Today we can say that, since this government came to office, we have created 926,000 jobs - that is, the unemployment figures which have come out today show the unemployment rate has remained at 5.4 per cent. What that means is we have seen an increase in the number of jobs of 71,500 in the last month. For the information of the House, this is the largest monthly increase in jobs since July 2000.                     Yes, they are very quiet over there -                      because Australians getting the opportunities and benefits of work is not something that the opposition likes to hear. This is the best monthly job creation result in 13 years. And to give this some perspective: the US economy created 236,000 jobs in February. What that means is that an economy 15 times bigger than ours is creating jobs at three times the rate - 15 times bigger and their job creation is only three times bigger than ours. That tells you about the resilience of the Australian economy, and we should be proud of it as a nation.                 But, of course, even with Australians getting the benefits of work, our economic future as a nation is not assured. We have to be making the right decisions now for our country's future. And today I had the opportunity to reinforce that, when we talk about the benefits of work, we also talk about the dignity and fairness that comes with work - making sure that people get treated fairly at work. We know that there are many Australians who are very reliant on the penalty rates they receive in their pay packets for making ends meet. So today I have announced that there will be a new modern awards objective in the Fair Work Act to protect penalty rates, because we understand how important they are. We will always put the jobs of Australians first, we will always protect the working conditions of Australians - and today is a very good day, as we get the news that more Australians have got the benefits of work.

  What we are seeing play out here today is an attempt by the opposition to put in place another fear campaign. I will make a couple of very, very clear points. This government makes no apology for putting growth and jobs first - absolutely no apology. It is the case that this government moved during the global financial crisis to support jobs and growth in our economy in the face of the worst global recession in over 80 years. And it is true that in that process we incurred some debt. But we did that to support jobs and growth. And what is the outcome of that process? Over 900,000 jobs created in Australia. Everybody on this side of the House is proud of that record because we understand the importance of the dignity of work. When an economy is challenged by a global financial crisis, what responsible economic policymakers do is support their economy.                 We have had some Tea Party rhetoric today from the shadow Treasurer about levels of debt. Our debt is around one-tenth of the debt of other major advanced economies, and the benefit we receive from what the government did over the past five years is 900,000 jobs. But of course they ignore the facts. They cannot answer the question about why Australia is one of the few economies in the world with a triple-A credit rating and a stable outlook. The reason we have a triple-A credit rating and a stable outlook is that we have strong public finances.                     I certainly am. I was asked a question about debt and I was going to go on and make this point. If you care about debt, if you care about paying it off, then you want our economy to grow faster. If you care about these issues, you should support employment. If you have contained inflation, if you have a strong investment pipeline and if you have low interest rates, you can support growth and jobs in our economy.                 But of course there is a different view. Those opposite would make a different choice than the choice we made during the global financial crisis and the choice I announced at the end of last year. Their choice would be to cut jobs and growth in the face of revenue write-downs. So Australia does have a very clear choice. Everyone on this side of the House stands for growth and jobs and those on that side of the House stand for big cuts in public expenditure -                      which will hit growth and jobs and result in higher deficits and higher debt. That is the Liberal future.

  I thank the member for his question and his ongoing interest in protecting Australian workers from unfair practices. This government is very proud of its record in creating job opportunities for Australians. We have avoided the worst of the GFC by taking courageous decisions and that is borne out yet again today by the unemployment figures. The facts are that there have now been 926,000 jobs created in this country since we were elected, 71,500 in this period, which is the highest amount since July 2000 - quite remarkable figures indeed. We will continue to do this because we have the right policies in place. But in doing so, in creating jobs, we want to make sure that we protect Australian workers and ensure that their conditions of employment are decent. That is what Labor governments do and that is why the government has announced reforms to the 457 visa system for temporary labour, because there is a concerning trend for the program in that the growth in the program is in the lower skilled occupations.                 There have been dramatic increases in sponsorships in the retail and hospitality sectors, which have basically doubled in the last 12 months. These are, as we all know, traditional sectors for young people to get their foot in the door and gain experience, often paying for their expenses while studying for another trade or profession. So it is important that these entry-level jobs are there for local workers.                 Indeed, there are a couple of examples that have been of concern to me recently. A pizza shop sought to employ a human resource manager, a position usually found in larger businesses. The department at the time was unable to prevent this sponsorship from occurring under the current rules, even though they strongly suspected that the position was not genuine - and they found, subsequently, that that was the case.                  In Parramatta a company was seeking to employ project and program administrators - or so they said - but when the department looked at the actual job descriptions it turned out that those 457-visa workers would be working as security guards. That was an abuse of the system that will be, of course, rectified by the efforts of this government to bring about the reforms that are needed. None of these was a genuine skills shortage and that is why we need to stamp out these rorts.                 Of course, we have a different position from those opposite. The Leader of the Opposition was suggesting that the 457 scheme should be the mainstay of immigration. That would displace Australian workers and undermine employment conditions and is not acceptable to this government.

  In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question: first, on the question of asylum seeker and refugee policy, the Leader of the Opposition is well aware that in line with his normal reckless negativity he came into this parliament and exercised his vote for more boats. That is what he did. He could have exercised his vote to back in the expert recommendations of the former Chief of the Defence Force, Angus Houston; a refugee expert, Paris Aristotle; and a foreign affairs expert, Michael L'Estrange. He could have listened to that expert opinion. Instead, he came into this parliament and put his hand up for more boats.                 I note that, on this topic of asylum seeker and refugee policy, today, of all days, is a very unusual time for the Leader of the Opposition to raise it, because he and his shadow minister are completely at odds on refugee and asylum seeker policy. The Leader of the Opposition has gone up and down the country, over a number of years now, saying he will stop the boats. He has never said how, but he will stop the boats! And he has said on radio today that he would be making a difference from the first few weeks. And he has said in the past that he would stop the boats in the first few months if he were ever elected; whereas his shadow minister last night said, 'I don't put timeframes on it and I'm not about to. I'm not making such forecasts.' Those were the words of the shadow minister -                      As I was saying, what we have had from the opposition, between last night and today, is complete chaos on this question. On this side of the House, apart from pursuing asylum seeker and refugee policy in line with the recommendations of the expert panel, we are rightly focusing on the question of Australian jobs. We believe that jobs are important to Australians: it is at the centre of what a Labor government does. And when there are more than 100,000 temporary overseas workers in Australia and when the rate at which these visas are growing is 20 per cent - far faster than the rate at which employment is growing - then we are concerned. We will always put the jobs of Australians first.                 I know that the Leader of the Opposition has a different perspective and that his policy is to make these temporary foreign visas a mainstay of our immigration system. For us, this is about the Australian economy, jobs, opportunity and working conditions, and in those we will always put Australians first. We recognise that there are from time to time legitimate skill needs, but we will make sure that a temporary visa scheme addresses that - and only that.

  Over the years, questions have been asked of environment ministers in which environment ministers are asked to comment on specific proposals. Every environment minister has answered those questions the same way and I do not propose to depart from that. If an environment minister in any way prejudges a development application, the application itself gets thrown out in court, and so it should, because the framework for an environment minister should be national environmental law, and national environmental law alone. The only additional issue that would be attached to the particular proposal the member for Dobell refers to would be if, when it was first made a controlled action, there was no concept of a water trigger - and there is now a proposal for a water trigger before this parliament.                 The particular mine that the member for Dobell refers to, as I understand it, has already been determined to be a controlled action and is in the beginnings of its process. I think there may have been a public comment stage already. What would happen in that instance is that they would be among the companies that are now being contacted by my department and directed as to what additional information would be required to take into account the broader impact on water resources should the parliament pass the amendment now before it.

  I thank the member for Greenway for that very important question. Jobs have been at the very heart of every single decision this government has taken over a five-year period. The decisions we took during the global financial crisis meant that we did not suffer the skills destruction, the high unemployment and the capital destruction that we have seen across so many other countries, developed economies, right around the world.                 We can see the benefit of that in today's job numbers. I know those opposite do not welcome these numbers, but everybody on this side of the House does welcome these numbers. We had 71,000 jobs created in February. That is the largest monthly increase in over a decade. Of course we should be cautious about monthly figures; they can jump around. What we can say is that there have been 200,000 jobs created over the past year and 926,000 jobs created since the government came to power. That is 920,000 additional families with a breadwinner with a job. It is 920,000 new careers or careers that have been restarted. It is 920,000 opportunities for a better life, because there is nothing more fundamental to security, nothing more fundamental to peace of mind and nothing more fundamental to dealing with cost-of-living pressures than to have a job - and to have a job with decent working conditions. That is why the government does put employment at the very heart of all of its economic decision making.                 You can see this is in stark contrast to what has happened elsewhere around the developed world. Unemployment hit 11.9 per cent in Europe a week or so ago. Countries there are still slipping back into recession. Those that have come out are slipping back in. Just look to the UK, where you see the impact of policies which hack away at growth and jobs. In the time that this has been achieved in Australia - over 900,000 new jobs - something like 28 million people globally have hit the unemployment scrap heap. This result for Australia is something that did not come by chance; it came by choice. It came because of a government that had the courage to take the big decisions in the face of the global financial crisis and the global recession. All of the time, jobs were at the very centre of our response, and that stands - as I said before - in stark contrast to some of the responses that are being seen in Europe and the response that has been seen in the UK, where they are on the verge of their third recession in four years. We do not want that for Australia.                 That is the backdrop to the decision the government took at the end of last year to support jobs and growth. We understand that, if your economy is growing, if you are generating jobs, that is good for your budget. That is good for public finances. That is not something understood by those opposite.

  To the member's question, first I would seek to confirm that we are talking about the Pauline Hanson who was a preselected Liberal candidate - that Pauline Hanson. I presume that is who we are talking about. We are talking about the Pauline Hanson whom former John Howard refused to condemn month after month after month.                   The member for Higgins then left the chamber.                     I presume we are talking about that Pauline Hanson. And I presume I am being asked a question by a man who - what consideration did he give to Australia's reputation around the world when he was minister for immigration? I would ask that question.                     As for the government's policies and what I have announced in the last few weeks, and what was addressed indeed by me and by the minister for immigration in this parliament today, at base I believe that jobs in Australia, in our nation, should first and foremost be available to Australians. Of course Australians are those who are born here and who have made Australia their home, of which I am one - a migrant to this country.                     'And migrants to this country', I just said, thank you very much.                     Because the opposition is not listening and is preferring to bellow, let me go through it again. I believe when we are looking at jobs and opportunities in our nation those jobs and opportunities should go to Australians first. They should go to Australians and we should make sure that we are always providing, particularly to our children but to our nation as a whole, the skills and abilities to seize those job opportunities. Even with the world's best training system there will be times when, because of peak demand or very specialised skills, you will need to fill skills shortages from overseas with temporary overseas workers. That will always happen, but I do not believe that a program of temporary overseas workers should be used to substitute for appropriate investment in training and skills - for example, the way in which that happened under the former Howard government in the healthcare system. I do not believe that that should occur.                 I also do not believe that, where there are Australian workers with skills and attributes to do the job, they should not get those job opportunities. Our 457 visa system, a system now with more than 100,000 people in it, should be the subject of crackdowns and rigour. We will always aim for that. I know the Leader of the Opposition has an entirely different set of policies and I think he is most decidedly wrong on that. We believe in jobs and this is the day on which we can point to our track record of creating jobs in this country.                  Leave not granted.

  I do thank the member for Hindmarsh very, very much for his question and for his support for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. He is right: today is a very, very significant day for people with disability and their families and carers, as we have seen the National Disability Insurance Scheme legislation pass this House, something that so many people right around Australia have campaigned for for years. I want to say to each and every person with a disability right around the country: your time has come. It is the case that we will see the National Disability Insurance Scheme start on 1 July.                 It will start for little children in the member for Hindmarsh's seat in South Australia, in other parts of South Australia and in the areas in and around Geelong. It will be a very big change for people with disability in the Hunter region in New South Wales. From next year, it will be here in the Australian Capital Territory. All of these areas will see the first stage of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. From 2016, we will see the implementation of National Disability Insurance Scheme right across New South Wales. This is a very, very significant reform and one which is at the heart of our efforts to build a stronger and fairer Australia.                 It will be a fairer Australia for those people with disability who have, for years, faced what is a cruel lottery, for people who never know whether or not they are going to get the respite they need and for people who never know how long they are going to have to wait for a wheelchair. People can now look forward to all of these things and to a change for the better.                 Also, right at the heart of this reform is our desire to see a stronger future for people with disabilities so that they, too, can participate in our society and participate where they can to get the opportunity to work. One of the major changes that this government has already implemented - thanks to the minister for employment services - is to take the cap off disability employment services, so that they too can enjoy the benefits that come from work. We have seen 136,000 people with a disability placed in employment. This government is all about making sure that people with disability get to take their rightful place in our society.

  Of course all the staff in my office have met all relevant requirements. I am unsurprised to get a question as petty and ridiculous as this on a day in which we have seen 71,500 jobs created for Australians. Nothing could make the contrast more stark. We are a political party focused on work and opportunities for Australians, as compared to this opposition with its adolescent, student politics games and its cheap personality politics. We will get on with the job of creating jobs.                     Once again, in the face of such silly displays from the opposition, we will get on with focusing on jobs and opportunity for Australians. We understand that, on that side of the parliament, your focus is on cutting back benefits for Australian families and refusing to put Australians first for job opportunities.

  I would like to thank the member for Banks for his question, because the carbon price has been operating now for nearly nine months. Despite all of the absurd, ridiculous and mendacious predictions from those opposite, the fact is that the economy is growing, jobs are growing and emissions are falling. In the first six months of the carbon price, emissions in the national electricity market in fact fell by 8.6 per cent. As we have heard already in question time, 71,000 jobs were created in the last month and 920,000 jobs have been created since Labor was elected to government.                 Beyond that, the government uses the carbon price revenue and has done so to make significant tax cuts for low-and middle-income earners. We have done that by trebling the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $18,200. The fact is this: that reform has freed up one million people from having to lodge a tax return and is providing tax cuts to over seven million people. In fact, 6.3 million people have received a tax cut of at least $300 a year.                 But not everyone supports those tax cuts, of course. Last week, I was on a radio panel discussion with the shadow Treasurer. I asked him during that interview, 'Are you going to reduce the tax-free threshold?' He replied, 'Well, we've said that.' So let's get it absolutely clear: the Liberal Party will be increasing taxes on low- and middle-income earners; they will be reducing the tax-free threshold -                      It is entirely relevant to the question. The fact of the matter is that the coalition will reduce the tax-free threshold - reverse the reform that the government made. They will increase income tax for over seven million people. The coalition will bring the lowest paid one million Australians back into the tax system. They will have to fill out a tax return and many of them will have to pay additional tax. It is a tax hike on over seven million people. That is coalition policy. There is no objection to it. That is the fact of the matter and the shadow Treasurer has confirmed it time and time again.                 We have the opposition leader endeavouring to re-present himself to the community as a sensitive and caring character who understands the cost of living, but what rank hypocrisy it actually is, because he does not understand it at all. He is taking a policy position to the election to increase taxes for over seven million Australian people. I will tell you what: we do not mind campaigning on that issue.

  To the member for Wentworth's question, in terms of the bill that is before the parliament and the scheme, the Public Interest Media Advocate does not regulate print or online media. That is not its function. In much of the public reporting on this matter and some of the statements that have been made publicly, people might have got the impression that it is the regulator directly. That is not true. It is true that, through the various inquiries that the government has had, including the Finkelstein inquiry, there was a recommendation for a statutory regulator of that nature, and the government specifically rejected that recommendation. We have instead gone down the path incorporated in the bill before the parliament. What that means is that news organisations can come together and create a press council or a number of press councils. There have been two press councils, effectively, in existence in recent times. So, media organisations come together and create a press council. They then work through the standards and mechanisms that the press council is going to engage in, how the press council is going to function and what standards it believes are appropriate standards. The role of the Public Interest Media Advocate is then to receive all of that work from the press council and respond to it as to whether or not, in the assessment of that very independent body - this is a statutory person, not a government person, and I do stress that -                      As I was saying before the point of order, the role of the Public Interest Media Advocate is then to satisfy itself that the press council that has come forward has adequate arrangements in place regarding standards of practice which reflect community standards and expectations about news and current affairs, appropriate and responsive complaints handling, arrangements for the body to publish agreed standards, appropriate governance arrangements and suitable funding arrangements. That is, this is about the media having a self-regulation model that attends to media standards. I believe that is appropriate. That is the bill before the parliament. I understand that the member and the opposition are looking for a bit of craven political advantage here from media barons. We will leave them to that kind of approach to politics. We will put the public interest first, and that is what we have done in this legislation.

  I thank the member for Bass for his question. Our government believes the distribution of GST should be fair and equitable. That is why Labor supports the principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation. It means that states, like the member for Bass's home state of Tasmania, get their fair share of GST funding so that they can provide vital services in areas like health and education, just like the larger states. These are the same principles that underpinned the GST when it was introduced by the Howard government more than 10 years ago. This government will not be walking away from those principles which ensure that each and every Australian gets a fair share, regardless of where they live.                 The same cannot be said for the Leader of the Opposition. Last year he flew over to Perth and told a number of journalists over there that, under the coalition, he would rip away hundreds of millions of dollars from smaller states like Tasmania and South Australia. He said:                 _ the GST revenue should be distributed on what is closer to a per capita arrangement.                 'This is the unified position of the Coalition premiers. I think it makes a lot of sense.'                 This government believes that we should govern in the interests of all Australians, not just those who live in a state that has a Liberal Premier - that is if you can keep up with who they are at any given point in time.                 Under the opposition leader's plan to move towards a per capita approach to funding, he will rip away $600 million each year from Tasmania. That will mean in Tasmania less money to fund doctors and nurses in our hospitals and less money to fund teachers in our schools. But I noted yesterday that the Leader of the Opposition came forward in the chamber and said, 'Tasmania will not be worse off.' How does this work? You are either going to rip money away from Tasmania or you are going to increase the GST.                 I know the Leader of the Opposition is not all that familiar with economics, but this is a simple case of mathematics. If you want to carve up a bigger slice of the GST for Western Australia then some other state is going to get a smaller slice.                   The member for North Sydney then left the chamber.                     It is always the reference to a slice of pie that gets him going!                     I withdraw. You cannot give states like Western Australia a larger slice of the pie without leaving states like Tasmania with a smaller one. There is of course one way you can do that and that is if your real plan is to increase the GST.

  Of course, cabinet deliberations are confidential, but I would remind the member that on 14 December -                      No amount of bellowing is going to change these facts. On 14 December 2010 the government announced the Convergence Review. On 2 March 2011 the Chair of the Convergence Review was announced. On 1 June 2011 the Convergence Review framing paper was released. In June submissions started coming in. For example, Foxtel's submission on the framing paper was received. On 6 July 2011 the Convergence Review's emerging issues paper was released. On 14 September 2011 a media inquiry was announced. On 28 October 2011 submissions started being received by the Convergence Review from entities like the Newspaper Publishers Association. On 1 November 2011 News Limited made a submission to the Convergence Review. On 11 November 2011 News Limited made its submission to the media inquiry. Then on 15 November 2011 we had the interim report of the Convergence Review released. On 10 February 2012 the News Limited submission on the interim report of the Convergence Review was received; so was the Newspaper Publishers Association's submission. Then we released the Finkelstein report, and the Convergence Review final report was released. All of that happened in March and April 2012. So across a period now of a number of years, through a public course of inquiries and investigations which were well known, well reported and apparently understood by everybody except the member for Sturt, who asked this question, the government has worked through the policy issues and therefore brought to the parliament the legislation that was announced a little bit earlier this week.                 As usual, from the opposition, what we continue to see is mendacious and silly claims, because the one thing they can never cope with, whether it is on carbon pricing, the economy, media policy or anything else, is the facts. They are simply beyond them.

  I thank the member for Moreton for the question. He has had over $90 million approved in 150 projects in schools in his electorate for libraries and multipurpose halls, and I know how important education is to him. It has been an important week for education. We started with the announcement by Minister Bowen and me of new special measures to make sure that graduates have the skills that they need when they get into schools and into classrooms. We had, with the Prime Minister, the launch of My School 2013, an important website that provides more information than ever before for families and school communities around Australia about how students and schools are going. This morning we read of some of those success stories. I have a bit of pride, if I can indulge, in Maroubra Bay Primary School in my electorate. It is doing very well under the National Partnership on Literacy and Numeracy.                 But I am asked about bullying. It is an important issue, I know, for everyone in the House. Some of the statistics are challenging, with around one in six kids bullied weekly. Sometimes it is even more. Certainly in terms of online bullying we are seeing increasing incidences around Australia. It is troubling. It is troubling for parents and schools. We all know that it can have really terrible consequences.                 We have the National Safe Schools Framework. It is the first of its kind in the world, developed with advice from experts, and we are providing extra resources for the National Safe Schools Framework so that there are good resources available for each school. We have a cybersafety help button for kids if they get into strife online. There is a 'Bullying. No Way!' website which contains particularly important information.                  Tomorrow is the third National Day of Action Against Bullying. I have been very pleased to launch the national day and to endorse it. More than half a million students will be out there saying, 'We will take a stand together because there is no place for bullying or violence in our schools.' It is an important national event. I certainly appreciate the support we have had from media outlets, particularly in Queensland, around it.                  This year we ran the first Safe Schools are Smart Schools competition for schools to highlight what they have been doing to address bullying. The member for Moreton will be pleased to know that one of the outstanding entries in the competition came from a school in his own electorate, the Warrigal Road State School. They have got a good program, the Playground Buddies Program. It is a peer mentoring program that is focused on safety, where buddies show that they are a good role model and help those students who need support. What have we seen? A safer school environment, less incidence of bullying reported in school and fewer kids saying that they did not have anyone to play with. This is a really important day for schools around Australia and for the community. We ask everybody to take a stand against bullying.

  For the Leader of the Opposition, who continues to pursue this mendacious campaign, the facts are these. In the last 12 months 186,583 new companies were registered, according to ASIC figures. That is an average of over 14,000 new companies created each and every month. The fact is that, since the introduction of carbon pricing, the number of companies going into administration went down, not up - a fact that the Leader of the Opposition should focus on. The fact is that since the start of carbon pricing on 1 July more than 130,000 extra jobs have been created. That is more than 20 jobs every hour since carbon pricing started. Australia has maintained one of the lowest unemployment rates in the developed world, at 5.4 per cent. The economy grew at an annual rate of 3.1 per cent in the year to December. Average weekly earnings are up by 4.6 per cent. Business investment has continued at very high levels, with almost $270 billion in confirmed investment into Australia's resources industry alone.                 The Leader of the Opposition is once again back on his carbon pricing fear campaign, prepared to do or say anything. What they will never do is acknowledge a fact. This claim today is exactly the same as the claims we have heard in the past: Whyalla being wiped off the map, $100 roasts, jobs being smashed, a wrecking ball through the economy - all of the ridiculous rhetoric the Leader of the Opposition has engaged in. Each and every claim made by the Leader of the Opposition about carbon pricing has been proved wrong, and, once again, he is wrong today.                     I know the facts weary the Leader of the Opposition, but my point is simply this: he is wrong now, as he has been wrong always, with his false claims about carbon pricing.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his important question. As we have just heard in the first question in question time, over the last couple of days the Leader of the Opposition, the New South Wales government and the Daily Telegraph have been misleading the public yet again about the impact of carbon pricing. Yesterday it was a false claim about electricity prices in New South Wales. Today the Daily Telegraph is back with ridiculous claims about economic catastrophe, repeated here today in the very first question by the Leader of the Opposition - there seems to be some commonality of approach that we are witnessing. The Telegraph story today takes the misuse of statistics, hysterical headlines and distortion of facts to levels that would have done Pravda proud during the height of the Cold War. That is the fact of the matter. The Telegraph says a record number of companies are going into collapse since carbon pricing. But, as the Prime Minister accurately and validly talked about a moment ago, that number is actually lower than for the previous 12 months when there was no carbon pricing in place.                 Indeed, when you look at the economic facts, which is helpful to do from time to time, we have seen nothing but a very strong economic performance since carbon pricing began on 1 July last year. We have seen 134,000 jobs created. As the Prime Minister indicated, that is more 20 every hour since carbon pricing started. We have seen 118,500 new companies started up since carbon pricing came into effect. And the stock market has increased by no less than 25 per cent. Compare that to the terrible doom and gloom that was forecast by the investment adviser sitting in the Leader of the Opposition's chair whose investment advice is accepted by no-one on the opposite side. What a catastrophe all of that represents: GDP growing by two per cent since 1 July; unemployment at 5.4 per cent - one of the lowest levels among the advanced economies; real wages up by 1½ per cent; and consumer sentiment up to a 38-month record high. This is not evidence of the catastrophe prophesied by the Daily Telegraph, or the wrecking ball prophesied by the Leader of the Opposition, or the cobra strike, or the python squeeze or any of the other wrecking balls that were prophesied by those opposite. The fact is that the carbon price is working; emissions are falling and the economy is growing. It is our responsibility to future generations to deal with climate change, and that is what this important reform is doing. Those opposite should recognise the facts.

  As I think I indicated in the House last week, we will be updating all of our budget forecasts in the normal way, and we will do that in the May budget. But I do want to make a couple of points about the budget and about economic growth.                 I want to make some points about jobs, because we on this side of the House make no apology for putting jobs and growth first. And of course, this is a matter of choice. Back during the global financial crisis, as a matter of choice, we chose growth and jobs. Those opposite would have left it all to chance, if they had been in power, and we would have seen a recession in Australia. As a consequence of the choice that this government made, there are 900,000 additional jobs in Australia today - as a result of our government making that choice to support jobs and growth. And just as we did back during the global financial crisis, we made a choice again at the end of last year - in the face of very big revenue write-downs which are flowing through our economy from a range of unique circumstances, which have been chronicled -                      The fact is that the financial statements which were published last Friday show that there has been a whack to revenues of around $6 billion in the first seven months of this year. Those opposite want to put their heads in the sand and pretend that nothing has changed. What changed at the end of last year was something very fundamental in our economy: we saw that the terms of trade went down and the dollar stayed up, and the consequence to our economy of that change is a huge whack to government revenues. It is unprecedented in our history to have a situation where the terms of trade go down and the dollar stays up. What that has done is put an enormous squeeze on profits and on incomes right across our economy. In the face of that we have opted to support jobs and growth. But those opposite would make a different choice - just like they did during the global financial crisis. The choice they took then was for recession; the choice we take now is for growth and jobs. The approach that they would follow is the approach we have seen overseas - we have seen it in Europe: slash and burn, cut jobs when revenue goes down, and debt goes higher and deficits go higher. We reject that approach. This is the approach of those opposite; it is the approach of the IPA, their favourite think tank - the IPA is in bed with them because they have a program to slash jobs and growth in our economy. We on this side of the House stand proudly behind jobs.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question and I thank her for her focus for her electorate on jobs, and the ability that that gives families in her electorate to build a life. My policy is always to see Australian workers in the front of the line when it comes to getting Australian jobs.                 Today the government has announced that the role of the Fair Work Ombudsman will now be expanded to monitor key 457 visa conditions. That is because we want to put Australian jobs first. That means the ombudsman will now ensure that 457 visa holders are being paid at the market rate specified in their visa. Secondly, and importantly, the ombudsman will also be able to check that the job being done by a 457 visa holder matches the job title and description approved in their visa.                 These changes are about two things: making sure that 457 visas are not being used to undercut pay and conditions in our workplaces and, very importantly, making sure that we protect the jobs of Australians by ensuring that 457 visas are used only for a job that an Australian worker cannot fill. Today's announcement means that the 300 staff of the Fair Work Ombudsman will now also be able to check on these matters as part of their day-to-day work. This is all part of the government's policy, of my policy, to put Australian workers first. If there is an Australian worker who can do that job, then they should get that chance.                 There are now over 100,000 holders of 457 visas in Australia - over 20 per cent more than last year - and the number of applications was up by 38 per cent. Year-on-year growth in applications in the hospitality sector is up 100 per cent and in retail it is up 80 per cent, while in mining it is actually down 18 per cent. I believe there are many jobs that Australians should not be missing out on. For example, there are many 457 visa holders working in the health sector because of the failure of the Howard government to adequately train doctors and nurses for the future. We will never believe that 457s should be a mainstay of our visa program. We will always believe that we should do everything to make sure that Australians are first in line for Australian jobs.

  I thank the member for his question. My answer is very clear: we will update all these forecasts in the forthcoming budget. But I am only too happy to talk about the Australian economy and the forthcoming budget. When you listen to those opposite, all you hear is them talking down the economy. And now we have this new fear campaign starting -                      Indeed it is. We do believe in responsible budgeting, unlike those opposite.                     I was about to make a very important point. This government has been accountable for every week of every year for the last five years. We have always presided over updates, we have always put our budgets out on time. In that five-year period we have not had one set of accounts from those opposite that pass the credibility test - not once. After the last election they were found to have had an $11 billion hole in their budget bottom line. So, over five years, there was one attempt to put forward an alternative budget, which had an $11 billion hole in it. I think that speaks volumes for the competence of those opposite. As we go forward they will seek to talk down our economy every day.                     We on this side of the House will get on with putting in place responsible budgets that secure growth in our economy and that secure jobs - 900,000 jobs over five years. Had they been in charge, what would we have seen? We would have seen an Australian economy that would have gone into recession; we would not have seen 900,000 jobs in our economy. We would not have seen an economy with solid growth, strong job growth, contained inflation, high investment and strong public finances. We had all those things because this government takes economic management seriously. Those on the other side of the House, if they aspire to be taken seriously, should start putting some properly costed policies on the table. The last time they put them on the table there was an $11 billion hole in those costings. That shows that if you support jobs, if you support growth and if you support strong public finances then you support those on this side of the House, not the rabble on the other side.

  I thank the member for his question. I certainly do understand the circumstances he is reflecting into this parliament on behalf of his community. Quite a number of communities have had to suffer over the past few summers on more than one occasion, facing floods and then seeing the devastation come a second time. And of course in this land of ours, at the same time that some of our communities are facing floods, others can be facing the devastation of bushfires. We have seen all of that play out across the nation and it has been very tough for people.                 I think we need to be clear about what has been achieved through natural disaster assistance, what more we can do and what we can do better. We do have a system now where the state and federal governments do work quickly together in circumstances of natural disasters. Indeed, we do not actually wait for a natural disaster to occur. When it is becoming apparent that there will be extreme weather conditions, we have federal officials embed at that point with state officials, who are always the ones managing the disaster in the first instance. We do that so we can seamlessly do what we need to do to get assets, such as ADF assets, available for local communities. Then, in the days immediately after a natural disaster, hardship payments are made available. Sometimes that is done through the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements between us and state governments, sometimes through the federal-government-triggered Australian government disaster recovery payment and sometimes through both.                 Concerns tend more to come in when we get to the recovery and reconstruction phase. The member is right that there are various categories of assistance, as agreed between the federal and state governments. There is category B assistance, category C assistance and what is referred to as category D assistance, which is the exceptional circumstances assistance. The rules surrounding the circumstances in which those relief programs are triggered do, I think, cause community concern. We have worked through and will continue to work through the ministerial council dealing with emergency management. We are always in the business of talking to our state colleagues and counterparts and to local communities about what can be done better - not only what can be done better in the teeth of a natural disaster but also what can be done to ensure more resilience, more ability to withstand extreme weather events, the next time around.                  The member has a genuine concern and I know he is not alone in this parliament in that regard. Many members representing natural disaster affected constituencies have the same concerns. We are always open to that local community feedback as we work with our state and territory counterparts.

  I thank the member for Werriwa for his question and his ongoing interest in ensuring that we do the right thing by workers in this country. The government believes you can have a strong and growing economy but also a fair society. It is for that reason we abolished Work Choices. Work Choices was about taking the low road. It did not encourage productivity and was not about enabling workers to participate in the workplace. That belief is also why we responded the way we did during the global financial crisis to support hundreds of thousands of jobs. That response is one of the reasons we are a growing economy - one of the fastest growing economies in the developed world - with about 900,000 new jobs being created since that time.                  Today the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and I announced that the Fair Work Ombudsman will be empowered to investigate employers who sponsor visa holders to ensure they are complying with the law. This is important too. It is important for ensuring that local workers get the first opportunity in the absence of genuine skill shortages in the marketplace, it is important for ensuring that employers who do the right thing are not disadvantaged by rogue employers who do the wrong thing and it is important for 457 visa applicants themselves.                  It is absolutely vital that we have the capacity to enforce the provisions which are in place now and the provisions and reforms I announced on 23 February this year. The Department of Immigration and Citizenship currently has 34 inspectors. They will now be combined with the more than 300 inspectors who work for the Fair Work Ombudsman. That will provide us with greater capacity to find breaches in the existing system. That is absolutely critical.                  Indeed, we do not want to see so-called human resources managers making pizzas; we do not want to see so-called project managers working as scaffolders on construction sites; we do not want to see an abuse of those people who are applicants or of those employers who do the right thing. Most importantly, we do not want to see those workers who have the skills and deserve the opportunities before anybody else miss out. That is very important indeed. This reform, this announcement, is very important because it will enforce the provisions that this government is going to put in place.                 By way of contrast, the opposition have said that they will not support these reforms and that they do not support more oversight over the 457 scheme. Indeed, the opposition leader has suggested that the 457 scheme be the mainstay of immigration. That is not the right approach. We would urge the opposition to support these reforms.

  In answer to the question from the member for Wentworth, the government does not have before this parliament and does not have as its policy a proposal to have a public interest media advocate that regulates newspaper coverage. That is not the case. That is a distortion of the reform proposition. I said it last week and I will say it again: I understand why the member for Wentworth is seeking to curry a bit of favour with those who run media outlets in the hope of some good publicity - presumably for himself; maybe for the opposition - in the future. I understand that craven attempt at political advantage. But on more than one occasion -                    The member for Indi then left the chamber.                     I was referring to the question before the chair and the distortion that appeared in the question of what the government's intentions are. There is legislation before the parliament this week. The government will continue -                      I withdraw. In answer to the question from the member for Wentworth, firstly, his question misconstrues the proposition that is before the parliament. Secondly, the parliament is yet to have a debate on these various pieces of legislation and the government obviously in that debate will be putting forward what is in the public interest in our nation. I am not going to speculate on the outcome in this parliament. We will work, as we always do, in good faith with those parliamentary members who are prepared to deal with reform propositions on their merits and on their facts.                 When it comes to reform propositions on their merits and on their facts, the member for Wentworth has characterised this reform proposition one way in his question. I would refer him to the following: according to the international and well-respected organisation Reporters Without Borders, Australia currently sits 26th in the world when it comes to a free press. The country in first place, Finland, has specific laws that dictate to media organisations that they must provide a right of reply and correct factual errors. We are not proposing to do that. In Finland, the press council gets 30 per cent of its funding from the government. We are not proposing to do that. Denmark, which is sixth on the list, has a press council that was established by legislation in 1991. We are not proposing to do that. What the government has put forward are some propositions clearly in the public interest. They are propositions about freedom of the press, about diversity of voices and about self-regulation by our media. We believe that they are propositions of merit to be pursued this week in parliament. We will join in that debate well and truly.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question and her ongoing interest in what is fair for Australian workers. Labor stands up every day for people who go to work. Labor believes in cooperative, profitable, productive, flexible and fair workplaces. Labor believes that you always need a strong safety net at work. We reject the idea that a person, regardless of where that person comes from, should be allowed to be exploited at work.                 I am pleased to report to the House the hard work of the Fair Work Ombudsman last year. In 2012, 12,000 workers submitted complaints of underpayment of a total of $33 million of wages. That was fixed. In other words, despite the conservative myth-making opposite, people go to work and get ripped off.                 In particular, what may be of interest to the member for Parramatta is that in 2011-12 there were 994 complaints from people working on temporary visas about exploitation at work. In fact, I can update the House that in the first half of 2012-13 there have been 900 complaints already. Indeed, I can inform the member for Parramatta that some of the complaints - some of the examples - include Fijian workers, marine labourers, working on barge refitting in the Port of Adelaide working seven days a week and not getting paid; and an Indian restaurant worker in Perth, who was in Australia on a temporary visa, working for four months, not being paid, and having to make an adverse action for unfair dismissal, as well as being subject to workplace bullying.                 I know that no-one in the House would condone any of those examples, but today what our Prime Minister has said, what the Minister for Immigration has said and what I have said is that we want to give the Fair Work Ombudsman more jurisdiction to deal with the real problems that are occurring rather than allowing the loopholes to occur. That is what we will do. We will stand up for Australians who go to work and ensure that they get fairness wherever they are. That is why we voted for the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. That is why we voted for a system to give equal pay to women in the community services sector. That is why we voted to increase superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. That is why we voted to ensure the Fair Entitlements Guarantee. Every time there is a debate about fairness at work, the government votes in favour of fairness and those opposite vote against it.                  I also happen to think it is not fair for people who go to work when the opposition play small-target politics because they are too scared to talk about workplace relations. Their suggestion for workplace relations is to refer it off to the Productivity Commission for report in 2016. That is not fair and there are no medals for policy bravery for the small-target opposition.

  Once again, the Leader of the Opposition finds himself absolutely incapable of dealing with the facts, even when they have been provided in the answer to the question before from the opposition. So, let's go through it again for the Leader of the Opposition, who most clearly was not listening to what I said before.                      I refer him to the respected international organisation Reporters Without Borders.                    The member for Boothby then left the chamber.                     I am dealing with a Leader of the Opposition who, of course, dismisses the work of climate change scientists, who brushes aside the work of senior public servants, and who never listens to an expert because he might be confronted with the facts. But I refer him to Reporters Without Borders and I presume that the Leader of the Opposition is not going to describe that international organisation as anything but genuinely dedicated to freedom of the press around the world.                 I refer him to the fact that the country in first place in their list as best on freedom of the press is Finland, which has specific laws which dictate to media organisations that they must provide a right of reply and correct factual errors. What the government is proposing is far, far, far less interventionist than that. Finland has a press council which is 30 per cent funded. We are not proposing that the Press Council be anything other than funded by media organisations themselves.                   The member for Mitchell then left the chamber.                     I am addressing the question because the Leader of the Opposition made an assertion about the government's proposed changes for media reform. If he did not want me to respond to that then he ought not to have asked it. His having asked it, I am going to respond to it. The Leader of the Opposition is deliberately - perhaps I will withdraw 'deliberately' and say 'misleading' - this parliament on the nature of these laws. I direct the Leader of the Opposition to international comparisons so he no longer goes around making absurd, false claims about these laws.                  What these laws are about is more Australian content on Australian TV. I think that is a good thing. What these laws are about is enabling our great public broadcasters like the ABC and the SBS to be out there providing news and information in more ways in the modern age. I think that is a good thing. What these laws are about is, in one of the most concentrated media markets in the world, if there are further consolidations in media organisations -                      In one of the most concentrated media markets in the world, we are ensuring, if there is further consolidation, that there is an independent view taken about diversity of voices in our democracy. Finally, we are ensuring that Australians who have a legitimate claim have a press council to go to.

  I remind the Leader of the Opposition that the thing called the global financial crisis happened. I remind the Leader of the Opposition, who knows nothing about economics, that we have just lived through the single-biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression. And I remind the Leader of the Opposition that in the circumstances of that economic crisis this nation faced a choice. You could see that crisis enveloping the world and you could decide that you were going to cut and cut and cut and cut and cut your budget. In order to do so you would have needed to do something like stop all payments to age pensioners or stop all payments for Medicare. Yes, you could have chosen to do that, and if you had done that then our economy would have catapulted into recession and hundreds of thousands of people would have been put out of work, and the future for young Australians wanting to be apprentices would have been destroyed forever. Instead of taking that reckless, irresponsible approach that developed nations around the world did not take - no developed nation around the world, not President Obama and not Prime Minister Cameron followed that prescription that the Leader of the Opposition apparently believes in.                 As a result of that, the government did sustain some debt, and we chose to do that to stimulate the economy. We are now living in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, where company revenue, corporate revenue to the government - indeed, revenue generally - has not returned to the levels that were predicted by our Treasury. Indeed, per unit of GDP, we are seeing less revenue to the government than at any time since the recovery from the 1990s recession. In those circumstances you have another choice: do you cut and cut and cut because of those revenue reductions, throwing people out of work, jeopardising growth in our economy? Is that what you do? Or do you pursue the strategy of the government, which is jobs and growth as well as a prudent budget position?                 The Leader of the Opposition might well say that his economic strategy would be to cut and cut and cut and cut. Well, if that is his economic strategy he should have the decency to tell the Australian people who those cuts would fall on, how hard they would hit schools, hit hospitals, hit family payments, hit pensioners and hit defence. He has an obligation to specify that. Instead, he comes in here with these statements that just show he has no understanding of the modern economy and that his only approach to issues of economic management is continued negativity and risk.

  I thank the member for Latrobe for her question. I know in an electorate like hers, home to so many families who are seeking to balance work and family life and who are very reliant on local childcare services, that she is incredibly familiar with the struggle it can be for people to get the child care they need and also to meet the cost of that child care. As a government we have always understood the pressures on families when children are very small and people are trying to mix work, family life and care for children, which is why we have increased support to help families with childcare costs. The way the former government did this was completely unsatisfactory, so we have moved to assist people with their out-of-pocket costs by increasing the childcare rebate to 50 per cent and by making sure that we have increased the maximum amount that people can get to $7,500. We have also understood that for families it is not just the costs; it is also the quality, that people want to make sure that their very precious children are well cared for. So we have had a clear focus on quality standards and early education in childcare centres.                  Now the government is in a position to announce that it is going further. We are ensuring that there are trials of new flexibility models for child care. We understand that many families engage in work - they might be police officers, they might be firefighters, they might be nurses - which requires them to work shifts in establishments that necessarily work 24/7. So we are devoting resources to ensure that we can trial some models of flexibility to meet the work and family life balance of people with those kinds of jobs.                 Today we are also announcing a new $300-million investment to help us with investment into childcare workers. People want to know that workers in childcare centres are appropriately rewarded for their work and they certainly want to know that there is a strategy for staff retention in the industry which means they do not face the circumstance where every time they drop their child off there is a new worker in the childcare centre, that they see childcare staff on a continuous basis, making sure they have a bond with the children they care for. This is the aim of what the government has announced today. We believe it is very important for staff in childcare centres. We believe it is very important, too, for parents, for families who rely on quality child care. We are very proud as a government to announce it because we believe it will make a real difference.

  It is extraordinary to get a question from the opposition about an international carbon price, a concept they do not even agree with. It is pleasing to hear that it might have some passing relevance to the introduction of a carbon price in Australia and perhaps, for the first time, some approval from those opposite - given the failure of their fear campaign about carbon pricing. The facts are these. This government budgets in a responsible way.                     We budget in line with the Charter of Budget Honesty set down by Peter Costello. So, as is the usual practice, we will bring our budget down in May and we will update all of our forecasts. We will do all that in May in the responsible way. There is a very stark contrast between the approach of us on this side of the House and the approach of those on that side of the House, because the Charter of Budget Honesty went out the window at the last election campaign. They did not comply with the Charter of Budget Honesty and were found after the election to have had an $11 billion black hole in their budget forecast, in complete breach of the charter.                     Most certainly. I was asked a question about budgeting and we do follow the Charter of Budget Honesty, unlike those opposite. So it is a bit rich to get the sort of question we got today from the shadow Treasurer about the Charter of Budget Honesty, which they breached massively in the last election campaign - just a little bit rich. Also we have a question about a carbon price they do not believe in.                 We will update our figures in the normal way in the May budget and wouldn't it be good if we could see from that side, just once, a costed policy? They are out there all the of time claiming that they are responsible. They are out there all of the time claiming that the government is spending too much. They are out there all of the time claiming there is an entitlement mentality and they are going to cut it back, but we cannot see one costed policy about anything.                     So, if you want some honesty about these matters, how about you, who believes that government is too big and government is spending too much, put a policy on the table that is costed and take it to the PBO.

  I do thank the member for that question, because this morning we had another reminder of the resilience of the Australian economy. We had some comments from Mr Lowe from the Reserve Bank of Australia. He made a number of points which have been made in the House before, but I think it is important that we go through them one by one. He made the point that we have got growth which is close to trend, we have got low unemployment and, of course, we have got low inflation and lower interest rates. He also made the point that the performance of our economy has been far better than most other developed economies. He made the point that we are so well placed to maximise all of the opportunities that are going to come from growth in the region, particularly in the Asian century. He acknowledged how difficult it has been in the global economy and particularly for Australia, given what has occurred within the global economy over the last few years. It is very important to get all of this into perspective, particularly when there are so many people coming into this House and talking down the Australian economy. He said:                  _ no matter what one's perspective, we should not lose sight of the fact that maintaining overall macro balance through this period of change has been a significant achievement. And it is an achievement that has benefited the entire community.                 There is no figure which better demonstrates that than the creation of 900,000 jobs over the past five years. We have had 900,000 jobs created over the past five years because this government has made the right choices at critical times in the development of the global economy.                  When the global economy experienced the global financial crisis and the global recession, we decided to support our economy, to support jobs and growth, to support small business. Of course we live with the benefit of that today, because our economy has jobs growth much greater than just about any other developed economy. But the other thing we have done during that five-year period is we have made the essential investments in the future to ensure prosperity for tomorrow, to make sure that we invested in skills and education. We have got to keep doing that because our future is not assured unless we make the investments for the future, which lift our productivity growth - hence the investment that the Prime Minister was talking about today in the early years; hence the school improvement program.                  All of these things have to be done in a modern economy - investing in the future, running a responsible budget policy. It is about doing all of these things because we believe in growth and jobs, and that goes to the core of living standards. There is a stark contrast here between this side of the House and the other side of the House. They talk about having a commission of audit. That is a plan that they have got to hide the truth. This is from the Campbell Newman play book. Their approach is not to have their policies costed, to go to the election and hide their plans to slash and burn jobs and growth. We on this of the House stand for jobs and growth.

  I thank the member for his question. What has become increasingly apparent across question time is that the opposition is now opposing the National Disability Insurance Scheme. One could not read any other intention from their questions. This is a very significant day in Australian politics. It is now apparent that one side of the parliament supports the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the other side of the parliament does not.                 On the funding of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, we budgeted $1 billion, properly accounted for -                      On the National Disability Insurance Scheme, we have properly budgeted and properly accounted for $1 billion for launch sites that will come into operation from 1 July this year. We have always said in relation to the balance of the full scheme as we reach agreements around the country - and we are still working hard on those; we have reached an agreement with the state of New South Wales - that we will work through COAG processes to reach agreement on the rollout of the full scheme. We, and I in particular, will ask the nation to make a series of quite tough choices, because we will need to fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme by making a set of what will be tough decisions as we look for savings and direct them to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We have always said that we would do that in the budget.                 In terms of our plans for school improvement, we are passionately committed to making sure that every Australian child gets a great education and that we truly distribute opportunity around our country to every child. I have spoken of my sense of disgust at the neglect of Australian schools engaged in by those opposite when they were in government. We have piece by piece worked to change that and we will do more through our National Plan for School Improvement and our school funding model.                 Once again - and I refer the member who asked the question to my Press Club address last year - we have made it very clear that we will be asking the nation to make a series of very tough choices as we look for savings in order to support that expenditure. Put simply, we think Australian children should come first. Those opposite might make a different set of decisions, but our decision is that Australian children and the quality of their education should come first.                 The government, as it makes announcements, obviously provides proper costings. That is a complete contrast to the approach of the opposition, which does not properly cost. That is how they got themselves into the $11 billion black hole. As we work through announcements and our budgets, we identify savings. We have identified $160 billion of them. We are waiting to see from the opposition a saving that genuinely stacks up.

  I thank the member for New England. I know that he is a very serious and responsible representative of his community. He is always interested in working cooperatively where he can to find savings where it is possible. When it comes to the further use of generics, Australia has already experienced a great deal of change in this area in recent years. Certainly there was a report a couple of days ago that suggested that we could make further savings in this area. But it is worth pointing out that over 1,400 brands of 137 medicines have already fallen in price by between 10 per cent and 87 per cent - some very substantial savings already. In 2010, there was a $1.9 billion saving in one go. More recently, we are looking at another $1 billion saving on the reduced price of generic medicines.                 The member for New England asked whether we should perhaps spend that money on the National Disability Insurance Scheme or on the very important education reforms. Both of those, of course, are priority policy areas for this government. They will make huge changes to people's lives - to the lives of Australians with a disability and to our next generation of young people. But I have to say that, as a health minister, I have some priorities of my own. We have listed $5 billion worth of new medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme list since 2007. They are very important medicines for a whole range of conditions. We have new medicines -                      Is the member for North Sydney saying that we should not be listing these new medicines for hepatitis C, chronic pain, cancer, arthritis, asthma, diabetes and specialist paediatric treatments?                 I want to say to the member for New England that I understand his concerns. I value the recent work that has been done by Stephen Duckett on looking for further areas in which to look for more savings. Indeed, I agree with him on the areas that he has named as important policy areas for the government. But as health minister finding that money for some of the important new medicines that we want to list is also a priority for me. We have worked hard to find savings in the older, more commonly used drugs so that we can make headroom for those exciting new treatments as they emerge.

  I thank the member for Moreton for his question. There are some 14,260 children who live in Moreton. In fact, the member has a four-year-old son called Leo who attends child care. There are 135 childcare services. Our decision to lift the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent resulted in an additional $7.5 million ending up in the hands of Moreton families in 2011-12.                 The fact is that the early years are absolutely crucial to a child's development, so it is very important that we have a professional early childhood workforce in place to improve the quality of early childhood services. That is why, as the Prime Minister has already referred to today, we were pleased to announce a commitment of $300 million over two years to improve the quality of child care through improved wages for early childhood educators through the early years quality fund.                  We really want to make sure that early childhood educators are well supported to do the best they can to care for and educate our children. The fund will provide services with the support to enable $3-an-hour increases for eligible certificate III qualified educators and proportional increases for diploma and bachelor degree qualified staff. It is a significant increase for early childhood educators.                  To be eligible under the grants the services will have to demonstrate a commitment to the National Quality Framework - an initiative which has been led by this government - which is intended to make sure that wherever families drop their kids off for early childhood care and education they know that the services are the best that they need to be.                 In addition, we will fund a pay equity unit to be established within the Fair Work Commission, and that will provide assistance with data and research collection and specialist pay equity information. This announcement is in addition to the government's existing investments of around $190 million in a range of measures to train and retrain a highly qualified early childhood workforce. That has included the removal of TAFE fees for diploma qualifications, a reduction in the debt of early childhood teachers, and introduction of formal recognition of prior learning assistance. We understand how important it is and we have continued to work with the states and territories on the Early Years Workforce Strategy.                 On top of that we also have the commitment to universal access for all kids in the year before they go into school, and we are seeing some extremely good results, with a number of states having their universal access figures really starting to deliver the goods. It is encouraging to see these improvements. I want to acknowledge the important work that was undertaken by United Voice - I think some of them are here today - and others. At the end of the day this government understands how important it is to support early childhood care and education and the workers who do an absolutely wonderful job delivering that service.

  I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. I am glad that he got it. To the member for Wentworth, his question contains a number of misrepresentations. As usual the member for Wentworth, bringing this question to the parliament, has misrepresented some facts in the question itself. But on the actual topic of media reform, which the member's question is directed to, I say to the member for Wentworth that reform in these kinds of areas is not easy but it is important. I have seen reported in the Financial Times that in the United Kingdom some reforms on media have been secured. I direct people to the reporting today, which says:                 Britain's politicians on Monday vied with each other to declare victory after 20 months of public hearings debate and chaotic last-minute haggling finally produced a new system of press regulation _ A Royal Charter enshrining press regulation was agreed at 2.30am on Monday in the Commons room of Labour leader Ed Miliband -                      I was answering a question about media and thought the member in the House might be interested in what has happened in the House of Commons and in the United Kingdom as it deals with media questions. I would have thought that was relevant and I would have thought the member for Wentworth would not treat with disrespect his sister political party in the United Kingdom. Before the member for Wentworth characterises the reform propositions before this parliament I suggest that he has a look at the reform propositions there, which go far, far further than anything in contemplation by the government or for the parliament.                 So, every ugly word and every criticism that the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Wentworth have directed against the government's reform proposals now need to be directed against Prime Minister Cameron and the British Tories or they will stand accused of the most gross hypocrisy. The House of Commons over there has gone far further than we are requesting the parliament to go here. But there are clear issues of public interest here - things that matter to the Australian community: being able to hear a diversity of voices in their democratic debate, being able to see Australian content on their TV screens, being able to make a complaint about the media should they choose to do so, and have that complaint appropriately handled.                  I recognise that these are important questions. Prime Minister Cameron has recognised that these are important questions. The only ones, with their typical negativity, not recognising that this is an important debate in democracies around the world is - you guessed it - the opposition.

  I thank the member for Greenway, who I know has a keen interest in this area as a new mother. I also know that she is a member who is determined, like us, that we be a government with a plan for a modern Australia. We are a government that has recognised that Australia's workforce has changed significantly in the past decade. In fact, we have seen over a 25 per cent increase in the number of women participating in the workforce, and we have seen a big growth in diversity in the roles which women are taking up. We also know that there are more Australian children in early childhood education and care than at any time in this nation's history. We know that that means parents need flexible options. Parents need a government with real policies, real programs and a plan for modern Australia.                 We understand that no two families are the same, that no two families will rely on exactly the same programs when it comes to managing their work and family balances. That is why we introduced changes to the Fair Work Act, to make sure that working parents have the right to request part-time work. It is also why we have introduced a range of flexibility trials at over 50 sites around Australia, in partnership with industry, with business and with childcare operators, to provide parents with more flexible childcare hours. We have also announced that the government will expand on these trials at 50 sites by establishing a $1.3 million Child Care Flexibility Fund. This will all form part of our $11 million plan to improve the accessibility and flexibility of Australian child care.                 The competitive grants program will build on the trials that have already been announced and that the Prime Minister referred to earlier question time. These trials will be working with family day carers partnering up with police officers, with nurses and with paramedics so that they can ensure that there is care available to match their rosters. There will be partnerships with long day care centres trialling an extension of hours for those parents who are doing the mad rush through peak hour traffic desperately trying to get there to collect their children before the centre closes. There will be a partnership with out-of-school-hours care, because we know that work does not always stop the moment the school bell rings and that parents need some assistance after hours. We want to add to that with even more partners, with even more innovative new ideas going forward so that we can ensure that Australian child care remains affordable, accessible, of high quality and flexible.                 All of these trials will be backed up by independent evaluation so that we can look at what can be rolled out as a more permanent measure and a wider rollout to assist more Australian parents. Ultimately we have real plans, real policies and we are getting on with the job of delivering for modern Australia and working parents.

  Getting big and important public policy reforms done is never easy. We know that as a government because we have been a government that has sought to shape the nation for the future and to make it stronger and fairer. It is not surprising to me that, when we are talking about something as contested as media reform, we have seen a fast and furious debate, and if we look around the world it is not just us. What would the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have said to a process in the House of Commons in the United Kingdom that had the final deal crunched between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition at 2.30 in the morning? Presumably, she would have criticised the process. But members of her sister a political party that saw the need to act in the public interest and actually get a reform through presumably thought engaging in that process was important for the people of the United Kingdom. When you are dealing with these big, complex reforms -                      of course there are times when the process has a bit of stress on it. Prime Minister Cameron has found that. In this parliament on a number of occasions we have dealt with bills late at night; we have dealt with bills under some pressure. But, unless the opposition is going today to go out and use about Prime Minister Cameron every word, every insult, every piece of criticism that they have used against the government, then they will stand condemned for the hypocrisy that this is, the absolute hypocrisy. There is Prime Minister Cameron with a model of intervention in the media, much stronger than anything ever contemplated by this government, and what do we hear? Absolute silence - because it is hypocrisy, pure and simple. The motivation here is no more or less than a bit of craven political advantage. The one thing that they will never do, that they will never bother about -                      that they will never worry about is of course the public interest.                     The document I had in front of me was 'MPs vie to claim press regulation win', from the Financial Times by George Parker, Political Editor, 18 March 2013. That was the document I had in front of me. I table it.

  I thank the member for Kingston for the question. The member for Kingston has been a champion of Murray-Darling reform. I am pleased to say that the reforms that were signed into law last year are locked in as of today. The disallowance period expires today. After a century of a tug of war between states, what was required was to get a moment in time when politicians from around the country were willing to accept that the negotiation could only be won by the rivers themselves. Whether it was the communities that were reliant on the rivers, producers who were reliant on the rivers or those who care about the environment seeing the degradation of the rivers, it was only ever going to be solved when the negotiation was won not by any one state but by the Murray-Darling Basin.                 In doing that, that moment in time that was required began late last year, when, after the plan had been signed into law, this parliament voted in massive numbers to keep the plan in place. That moment concludes today, where the disallowance period expires. It is now clear that after inaction and challenge for more than a century we have a situation where a century of degradation now turns the corner and, year after year after year, we see the Murray-Darling Basin being restored to health.                 There are many members of the community who deserve acknowledgement for their part in a long-run campaign.                     I have acknowledged members of the opposition before. You do not get overwhelming numbers in a parliament like this without a level of bipartisanship. But I will also say that none of us deserve more credit than Henry Jones, who is in the parliament today. He is a fisherman from down in the Lower Lakes in Coorong, down near Goolwa, who has been a champion of Murray-Darling reform for a long time. He has been the face of the advertisers' campaign to save the Murray and deserves great credit for achieving what activists for a century had failed to.                 For those traditional owners, for the communities who were involved in the consultation and for the many people who have seen a challenge that has always been out of reach, it is important for us to acknowledge that this has been the parliament that has solved what no other parliament could. This has been the parliament that has guaranteed that the Murray-Darling Basin will be restored to health and that the degradation of the past is now a thing of the past.

  To the Leader of the Opposition, if he wants to answer his own question about motions of confidence I suggest he has a look in this book. I know that he managed to serve as Leader of the House for years without opening it, but it is called House of Representatives Practice, and he will find the answer.                 On the question of when the election will be, the election will be on 14 September. Let me say very clearly to the Leader of the Opposition, it will be a contest counterintuitive to those believing in gender stereotypes but a contest between a strong, feisty woman and a policy weak man and I will win it.                   The member for Sturt then left the chamber.                     If the Leader of the Opposition is upset in any way then I withdraw.                     I withdraw.

  I would like to thank the member for Bass for his question. This government really respects low-paid workers. We understand that there are a lot of Australians who go to work who do not earn the average wage. In fact, members of the House may be interested to know that one in seven of every Australian that goes to work receives the minimum wage. Members of the House may or may not be aware that the minimum wage in Australia is $15.96 an hour. We know that these Australians who work so hard are paying taxes and delivering profits for their companies. We also know they are raising families, they are building communities and they are making Australia a better country. That is why it is important that this government stands and supports low-paid workers with a strong safety net. The sort of people I am talking about work in accommodation and they work in retail. They drive through the night doing part-time work in the trucking industry and they work in administration. Many of them did not get the chance to finish school. Many of them are from migrant backgrounds. Some are single and many are young.                 What we are doing to support low-paid Australians, the people who help make this country, is we are lifting superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. Only we voted for that. We are ensuring that truck drivers have safe rates of pay. We are increasing the tax-free threshold to $18,000 and we are abolishing the tax that people who earn less than $37,000 a year pay on their superannuation. We are making sure that community sector workers, an industry predominantly worked in by women, get some pay equity. Today, we are making sure there is a down payment for Australia's childcare workers, with whom we entrust our children for their development and safety. So our government absolutely stands up every time for low-paid workers.                 The member for Bass asked: are there any obstacles? I am afraid there are. It is an obstacle when one side of Australian politics refuse to ever talk about their workplace relations policy. There is a problem in this country in politics when the opposition complain on one hand - they say there is a flexibility problem - yet on the other hand they never actually say what they mean. When you are on the minimum wage, you have no flexibility between balancing your family budget and going to work. When you are on the minimum wage -                      Up goes the IQ of the chamber.                     I withdraw.                   The member for Mayo then left the chamber.                     When you are on the minimum wage, you need those penalty rates on the weekend to be able to pay your petrol bills to get to and from work. When you are on the minimum wage you do not always have the choice of prioritising family over work. People on the minimum wage in this country - one in seven of Australians - who work hard deserve better from the opposition than the opposition's complete refusal to engage in workplace relations policy in this country.

  I want to first thank the member for Chifley for his question. We had some good news for patients today: we saw that bulk-billing rates are up to 82 per cent. That puts them at equal historic highs. Indeed, in the member for Chifley's electorate, 99.1 per cent of GP services are bulk-billed - a phenomenal achievement, and a sharp contrast with the 67 per cent rock-bottom rates reached when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister. We all remember how he slashed training places, leading to doctor shortages.                 Sadly, times have not changed - because the party that killed Medibank now wants to kill Medicare Locals. Australians are rightly proud of our universal health system, and Medicare Locals are the logical extension of our universal system. The decisions are made by local doctors, local nurses, local health workers, communities and patients - decisions made by communities themselves rather than a one-size-fits-all approach from Canberra. All of this is helping make a stronger, smarter, fairer Australia.                 Last week we had confirmation from those opposite that of those local health workers, doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, psychologists, podiatrists, speech pathologists and pharmacists, thousands will get the sack if Tony Abbott ever becomes Prime Minister -                      because $1.2 billion will be cut from primary care. What does that mean in practice? In the member for Chifley's electorate, we know what it means. We were out there just last week, with the member for Greenway, announcing $500,000 for a diabetes prevention program - very important in their local community, where diabetes is a huge problem.                 Also in Western Sydney is an after-hours service, run by the Nepean-Blue Mountains Medicare Local - cut, if those opposite form government. In country Victoria is a service to transport people with chronic conditions, run by the Lower Murray Medicare Local and the Royal Flying Doctor Service - cut, under those opposite. The Southern Adelaide-Fleurieu-Kangaroo Island Medicare Local is lifting child immunisation rates - cut, by those opposite.                     It is a very clear choice: more decisions made locally by local communities or $1.2 billion -                     -                      They are not bureaucrats; they are doctors, nurses, psychologists, podiatrists, speech therapists, health workers - losing their jobs.

  First, the member should acknowledge that over 130,000 jobs have been added to the economy since the introduction of the carbon price, in complete contrast to the negative, false fear campaign run by those opposite, who tried to scare Australian workers and pretend that, as a result of carbon pricing, hundreds of thousands of jobs would be lost - every claim shown to be incorrect.                 And yet, despite every claim shown to be incorrect - their claims about jobs, their claims about the mining industry, their claims about cost of living, their claims about Whyalla being wiped off the map - they continue the fear campaign, rub their hands whenever there is any bad news about any worker losing his or her job and desperately try to do anything they can to blame it on carbon pricing, irrespective of the facts. What the member should well acknowledge is -                      Thank you very much. After that offensive interjection, let me assure the parliament that I care about it very deeply, and I respect these workers enough to believe that they should be told the truth and not used as pawns in the opposition's ugly political game, the way they have used workers as pawns against carbon pricing.                 We have had the Leader of the Opposition go to workplaces and raise fear amongst working people that they were going to lose their jobs, only to see some of those businesses grow, thrive, prosper and expand since the Leader of the Opposition has been there. That is treating people with contempt. That is treating people with disrespect. That is the conduct of the opposition.                   The member for Mackellar then left the chamber.                     After that display of contempt for working people, in answer to the member's question he well knows that the businesses he refers to have on their shoulders the pressure of the high Australian dollar and some of the economic circumstances that have flowed since the global financial crisis. Our attitude is to work with manufacturing and to work with businesses to help them and to help employment. The attitude of the opposition is to cut that assistance and to end those jobs - hundreds and hundreds of thousands of them around the country. That is what the member stands for. On this side of the House we stand for jobs and jobs have been created - 130,000 of them - since a price was put on carbon.

  I thank the member for Blair for his question. I know he has a keen interest in the meat industry. The fact of the matter is that nine months into carbon pricing the meat industry is one where you can look quite clearly at how the carbon price is working to help transform the economy. In the industry it is reducing carbon pollution and driving investments that improve the industry's competitiveness.                 Those opposite made many dire, terrible, doom-and-gloom predictions about the future of the meat industry as we went towards 1 July last year, with its introduction. It will be recalled that Senator Joyce predicted a $100 lamb roast and that a single head of beef going into an abattoir would cost the abattoir $575,000. That is the nature of the absolutely ludicrous claims that were made, joined in by the Leader of the Opposition. The member for Wright raised the case of AJ Bush and Sons and their Bromelton plant in Queensland, in particular. He said that that particular meat facility would face an 'absolute walloping' from the carbon price. He visited the abattoir with Senator Joyce and prophesised all the terrible doom and gloom about never being able to afford another T-bone.                 But now that we are nine months into carbon pricing, what has actually happened at the Bromelton plant is quite interesting because, with government support, the company is capturing its methane emissions, cutting its electricity bills and also cutting its emissions. It is doing it through an investment in a biogas facility and more energy efficient boilers. Recently, in the Beaudesert Times, AJ Bush's manager, David Kassulke, previously a critic of carbon pricing, said that these investments will cut their emissions by more than half and allow the company to produce half of the plant's electricity requirements. He said that as a consequence the abattoir 'will ultimately be in a much more competitive position in the marketplace as a direct result' of carbon pricing -                      This is exactly what he said:                 What the imposition of the carbon tax has done is make industry take stock of what it is currently doing and has forced it to look at doing things in a better way. It means companies are now looking at ways to use less energy which equates to less cost _ That has been the intention of the tax and clearly from that perspective it is working and working well.                 That is a quote from the head of AJ Bush at the Bromelton facility in Queensland. They are supportive of how the carbon tax is working. It is working and working well, cutting their electricity bill in half and reducing their emissions by a half. The only walloping at AJ Bush has been to the credibility of the member for Wright, Senator Joyce and the Leader of the Opposition for all of the ridiculous and bizarre claims that they will be held to account for.

  The Leader of the Opposition has asked this question in various forms across the course of the week and each and every time he does so he exposes his lack of competence in economics and the fact that the opposition wanders around pretending that the global financial crisis did not happen. I presume that if a journalist asked the Leader of the Opposition at a press conference if the global financial crisis happened, he would do what he normally does when confronted by hard questions, and that is, turn on his heel and end the press conference.                 But, yes, the global financial crisis did happen. Yes, it did have implications for the Australian economy. And, yes, there are ongoing implications for government revenue, and our economy is being transformed by a high and sustained Australian dollar, sustained high at 50 per cent above recent levels - a 50 per cent appreciation in a very limited number of years. It has been sustained high despite a decline in our terms of trade and sustained high despite a reduction in interest rates. With these factors working in the global economy and in our own economy, we are seeing implications for government revenue that have been made clear during the various budget updates, including the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook.                 In those circumstances you are presented with a very stark choice: you can either support growth and jobs or - which I assume is what the Leader of the Opposition is saying he would do if he were Prime Minister - cut and cut and cut. Let's be clear about the dimensions of the kind of cuts required. If that had been the approach taken during the depth of the global financial crisis, you would have needed to have done something as significant as ending all payments to aged pensioners.                     To the Leader of the Opposition: of course we will deliver the budget, and budget forecasts will be updated in the usual way. Our economic strategy will always be to support jobs and growth, and we will continue to take our current approach to prudent financial management. If the Leader of the Opposition ever wants to produce anything that looks like a suite of figures for the Australian people to analyse, it would be a very different outlook from that of the past. Not one policy has been properly costed or matched with credible savings since the 2010 election; not one. And it is time the Leader of the Opposition actually tried to acquit that burden of leadership rather than carping with these kinds of questions.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. Having visited with her in her electorate, I know that her electorate is home to many Australians who have retired. No wonder they choose to retire there - it is a beautiful part of the world. Consequently, many people in her electorate and pensioners around Australia - 3.5 million pensioners - will be interested to know that today they will see an increase to their pensions. Single pensioners at the maximum rate will get a boost of $35.80 a fortnight and couples a combined increase of $54 a fortnight.                 As well as increasing the pension, we are also increasing the deeming rate. What that means is that more than 740,000 Australian pensioners will benefit. This comes on top of delivering the biggest increase to pensions in more than a century. Since 2009, Labor has delivered an increase of $207 a fortnight for single pensioners and $236 for couples on the maximum rate. Coupled with our new indexation arrangements, this means that the pension is keeping pace with the cost of living in a better way.                 We also want to make sure that there is more assistance for pensioners to help them make ends meet, so we have increased the utility allowance to $400 a year. We are providing an extra $350 a year for singles and more than $530 for couples as part of the household assistance package. Pensioners received some of this through a lump sum last year. The rest will be paid through the Clean Energy Supplement, starting today. We are also delivering tax relief, with the new seniors and pensioners tax offset worth up to $2,230 a year for singles and $1,602 a year for each member of a couple.                 We have made these decisions because we have set clear priorities for the $160 billion in savings that we have found across five years of budgeting. That is because we wanted to direct money to those who need that assistance the most, and that includes Australia's pensioners - 3.5 million of them - who will see an increase in the pension from today.

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for that question, because what it really demonstrates is his ignorance of fiscal policy and how it has operated in Australia over the last 21 years.                     They have just compared the Australian economy to that of Cyprus - that is how ignorant they are and those are the lengths they will go to to talk down our economy.                   The member for Casey then left the chamber.                     Everybody on this side of the House is proud of the fact that in Australia we have had 21 consecutive calendar years of growth. What has that been based on? It has been based on good fiscal policy. It is based on the fiscal policy that we have put forward in the House and the fiscal policy that those opposite used to put forward in this House. We are committed to a medium-term fiscal policy that delivers surpluses on average over the economic cycle. That is something that those opposite are now rejecting.                 The proposition that they are bringing into this parliament is that we should cut our budget for every dollar of revenue lost because of the global financial crisis. The proposition that they are now putting to this parliament, in complete repudiation of what the previous government was committed to, is that we should have cut $160 billion from expenditure in Australia in the face of those revenue write-downs. What that would have caused in Australia is a very substantial recession, very high unemployment and a lot of misery in the Australian community.                 Because we on this side of the House had the courage of our convictions to respond to the events of the global financial crisis and the aftermath of that, we have incurred some debt - modest debt; one-tenth -                      He is now saying that we are going after people's bank accounts. Is there no end to how desperate this mob can get when it comes to fiscal policy, no end to how irresponsible they can get in this House? They prove every day that they are incapable of understanding or running a $1.5 trillion economy.                 The fact is that I talked this morning to about 40 overseas investors. I spoke to them about the fundamentals of the Australian economy: solid growth, low inflation, lower interest rates and a strong investment pipeline. These fundamentals of the Australian economy are things that a finance minister anywhere else in the world would be proud to have and give their right arm to have. But what we must do is put in place responsible fiscal policy that supports jobs and growth. Because we had the guts to do that, there are 900,000 extra jobs in Australia and 900,000 families with security and the prospect of future careers. What they would have had under that mob is high unemployment, low growth and a very significant number of business closures. They are showing how reckless they are.

  I thank the member for Capricornia very much for that question, because this government is all about making sure that after a lifetime of work we provide security and support to our older Australians, especially those on the age pension, as part of building a stronger and fairer Australia. That is why from today Australia's 3½ million pensioners will start to receive the latest increase to their pensions. If you are a single pensioner on the maximum rate, you will receive an extra $35.80 a fortnight. If you are a pensioner couple on the maximum rate, you will receive an extra $54 per fortnight. These increases also include Labor's clean energy supplement, which has been added to make sure that pensioners have extra help with their bills. That will add up to $13 a fortnight for singles and around $20 a fortnight for couples. All of this is about making sure that we give the extra support to pensioners that they need. The Prime Minister has already indicated that from today the government has also decided to lower the deeming rates. This will be particularly advantageous to those part-pensioners who are reliant on their investment.                 It is the case, as the member for Capricornia knows, that millions of Australian pensioners are better off as a result of this Labor government. This government has made sure that since 2009 there have been improvements to the pension. In fact, if you look at the amounts, single pensioners on the maximum rate are now $207 a fortnight better off. Pensioner couples on the maximum rate are $236 a fortnight better off. They are better off because of this Labor government.                 Pensioners know that under Labor their pension increases will be guaranteed. They also know that this Leader of the Opposition will reach into their pockets and take this money straight out. He will claw back the money out of the pockets of pensioners. If you are a single pensioner, $350 a year will be taken out of your pocket by this Leader of the Opposition and $530 a year will be taken out of the pockets of pensioner couples. That is what this Leader of the Opposition would do to pensioners if he ever got the chance.

  Yes, I do stand by all of my previous comments. What we are seeing here are the tactics of the Tea Party transferred from the United States and now writ large in the Australian parliament. What we are seeing here are these economic Neanderthals saying that there is no level of debt that we should have to support our economy at a time of crisis. That is what they are saying.                 We did go into debt to support our economy at the height of the global financial crisis and its aftermath. The consequence of that has been some of the best economic outcomes seen anywhere in the developed world. When there are 28 million unemployed around the world and unemployment in the United States is well over seven per cent and in the Eurozone it has hit 11.5 per cent, it is simply amazing to sit here in Australia and think that unemployment is 5.4 per cent, particularly after that bout of volatility that occurred in the latter part of last year where half of the advanced economies contracted in the December quarter. That has been the environment we are operating in, and what we have done is run a responsible fiscal policy, with a modest level of debt, to support jobs and growth.                 We on this side of the House will never apologise to anyone for putting jobs and growth first for Australians. That is what we are doing: we are putting jobs and growth first in our fiscal framework, which is a commitment to surpluses on average over the economic cycle.                 Those opposite like to believe there is not such a thing as an economic cycle, that nothing happens in the global economy, that there are not changes in our economy and that there are not challenges. They come in here with no appreciation of the fact that, in the last quarter of last year, there was a very substantial fall in the terms of trade and our dollar is still through the roof. They do not want to pay any attention to the fact that that has had a substantial impact on revenues over and above the $160 billion worth of revenues that we have lost during the global financial crisis. These economic Neanderthals just want to pretend that has never happened.                 I tell you what: you cannot make responsible policy when you are operating like some Tea Party politician from the United States. This fear campaign that they are trying to import to Australia is nothing more and nothing less than economic Neanderthal behaviour -                      not facing up to the realities and challenges of our modern economy. We on this side of the House will face up to those challenges. We will put in place responsible policies which support job creation and growth. Those opposite are going to follow the Campbell Newman approach. They will have a commission of audit -                      and, if they get elected to government, they will do the same as Campbell Newman: they will get out there and slash and burn when it comes to the social safety net. They will take an axe to jobs. They will never, ever support Australian workers. They will take an axe to jobs and they will go back to Work Choices. There is a very clear choice here.

  I thank the member for Melbourne for his question. A person can only be arrested for extradition purposes if Australia has received an extradition request and a valid Australian arrest warrant is in place. It is a longstanding Australian government policy, honoured by both sides of this House, not to disclose whether Australia has received an extradition request from another country.                 I cannot comment on hypothetical cases, but I can tell the House that, in making decisions on extradition requests from other countries, the Australian government reaches its own conclusions on the appropriateness of granting those requests. In making these decisions, thorough consideration is given to our domestic and international legal obligations and all of the relevant circumstances of the case.                 That said, I can confirm that Mr Watson is not subject to any arrest warrant under Australian government jurisdiction - and I would say this also: the position of our government on whaling is very clear. We have initiated proceedings against Japan in the International Court of Justice, seeking to bring to an end Japanese whaling in the Southern Ocean. I expect that case to come on for hearing later this year.                 In relation to the other matters raised by the member for Melbourne, the Australian government does not provide assurances about whether a person will be subject to extradition proceedings either now or in the future. But, as I have made clear, a person cannot be extradited from Australia in the absence of an Australian warrant and the approval of the Australian government. In making decisions on requests for arrest warrants to be issued, the Australian government reaches its own conclusions about the appropriateness of granting such requests, and they are based on our legal obligations.

  I thank the member for Deakin for that question, because the government are very proud of the support that we are providing to senior Australians. We do understand the importance of cost-of-living pressures for many retirees and people living on the pension. We are also very proud to have delivered the largest increase in the age pension in over 100 years. We did that in an economically responsible way, but it was something that those opposite could not deliver over 12 years in office. We made room in our budget; we changed our priorities because senior Australians were our priority. Of course, we are now seeing increases to the maximum rate again of $35.80 a fortnight for single pensioners and $54 a fortnight for pensioner couples. Building on those big reforms of September 2009, the pension has increased by more than $200 a fortnight.                 It is not just what we are doing with the pension; it is also what we have done with the tax-free threshold. This is of enormous benefit to many seniors and self-funded retirees - people on relatively low incomes. It delivers a huge benefit to part pensioners and also some self-funded retirees. It really ought to be remarked upon: this has been a fundamental reform not just in terms of workforce participation for many low-paid workers but for many low-paid retirees as well - a very significant benefit.                 Of course, you do see a very stark contrast between what this side of the House has done and what the other side of the House are about to do. They are about to get stuck into the pensioners yet again, because that is in the Liberal Party DNA. What they want to do is rip away $350 a year from single pensioners and $530 a year from pensioner couples. That is $1 billion a year from older Australians and it is deeply irresponsible, but that is the policy of those opposite.                 But you can only put in place these policies if you put in place a responsible economic policy. If you have got  a medium-term fiscal strategy that you adhere to, if you keep your economy growing, if you put in place the very big reforms to ensure prosperity tomorrow, if you put in place the policies that deal with the ageing of the population, all these things are possible. But of course those opposite are following the Newman principle - they have got this commission of audit. That commission of audit is only about hiding the truth, not bringing out the truth, because the truth is that, given their $70 billion hole in their budget bottom line, it is going to be pensioners and many other people on low incomes and many workers who are going to lose their jobs if they are in office.

  The answer to the member's question is, yes, of course I do. And the answer to the member's question is, yes, it is only this side of politics that has a vision and a plan so that our nation has broadband around the country and we can seize the jobs of the future and the productivity benefits for the future and we can deliver services in new ways.                 Let us not forget the performance of the opposition at the last election, when the Leader of the Opposition seemed to believe that the only reason people would ever want broadband is that they would want to download movies faster. That was the limit of his understanding about the world of new technology and the world in which we have to shape our nation's future.                 What we understand on this side of the parliament and what the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy is in the lead of for this nation is ensuring that we have the infrastructure for this century that our nation needs. It is impossible to imagine us being a strong, productive economy in the future if other nations have the benefit of broadband and we do not - impossible. It is impossible to imagine us having those jobs and that prosperity.                 It is also wrong to deny pensioners, to deny people in their homes, to deny students who want to learn, the benefits that come from the services that can be delivered across broadband. I want our children to get a world-leading education. That will be impossible if other children around the world have the benefit of learning through broadband and our children do not. I want our older Australians to have the benefit of the state-of-the-art technology that enables them to stay in their homes longer, with their medical conditions and welfare appropriately monitored through the National Broadband Network. I want regional Australia to no longer feel the tyranny of distance but for businesses in country towns around our nation to be able to compete with businesses around the world in the same way in which they could if they were in Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane's CBD.                 This is the vision of broadband for the future. Because the opposition has had so many - the number is in the dozens - failed broadband policies, I can understand why the member for Wentworth comes into this place absolutely unable to argue the merits and so he intends instead to attack the person. On this side of politics, we will get on with the job of rolling out broadband, because I want our future to be one of strength and prosperity. Unfortunately, that vision is not shared by the opposition.

  I thank the member for Corangamite for his very important question and his ongoing support for workers in his region, the Geelong region. It is important that we get this right. It is important that we put in place protections for workers in all regions of this country. I note that in November last year the then Premier of Victoria, Ted Baillieu, wrote to my predecessor, Minister Bowen, seeking a change to the draft guidelines for regional migration agreements that would allow them to apply to both Bendigo and Geelong. Currently the guidelines outline that such an agreement 'will facilitate labour flows to regional areas where there are acute skill shortages and, in particular, regions that are isolated from large populations and do not have local skills'. In those circumstances, under the draft guidelines, I could understand the proposition. But Geelong and Bendigo are not remote areas and nor do they have, in the broad sense, acute skill shortages. They still have the possibility to use the 457 visa legitimately with applications, but this approach would be very, very dangerous for the opportunities for workers and trainees and apprentices in these areas. Moreover, Geelong and Bendigo have an unemployment figure that is higher than the national employment average.                 What the Victorian government is effectively saying by writing to the Commonwealth is, 'We want to make it easier to bring in hundreds, if not thousands, of overseas workers to take jobs in this region before we provide opportunities to those that live in that region.' The very same government, of course, announced cuts to training and TAFE places, so we have the situation where we have a Victorian Liberal government looking to cut spending in training in a region and at the same time requesting the federal government provide them with a new arrangement to open up the 457 scheme to apply in a way that does not operate in the conventional sense. That is a recipe for disaster. That is a lethal cocktail that will actually cause problems for workers who deserve the first opportunities in Geelong and, indeed, in Bendigo. It will indeed reduce the chances of young people getting training and therefore skills, because of the cuts, and deny them opportunities.                 That is bad enough. But we have as well a federal opposition that has announced that they will remove the protections currently in place for the 457 scheme. They have also said that they want to restore access and bring it back to the way in which it was used under the Howard government. They said it was perfectly fine then.                 That is not the case. If you remove those protections, if you allow Victorian Liberal state governments to continue to cut training places and TAFE budgets, you will see too many young people missing out and too many workers missing out on genuine opportunities to get a decent job.

  I can certainly say I personally have spoken to the Independents - a number of them - during the course of the week about a range of matters. I see them regularly. They raise electorate matters with me. For example, the member for New England raises electorate matters with me, and there have been some interesting events in his electorate overnight so I am sure they will come in for some discussion as well. I have not had anybody raise with me the topic the Deputy Leader of the Opposition refers to.

  I thank the member for Blair for his question, because the government, in implementing the carbon price, has done it in an economically responsible way, a way that is environmentally effective and that is socially fair. The Household Assistance Package that is funded from the carbon price features a number of elements, one of which is the Clean Energy Supplement that commences for pensioners today.                 As we have heard from the Prime Minister and my colleague ministers in question time, the new Clean Energy Supplement, starting today, paid alongside the age pension, is worth an extra $13.50 per fortnight for single pensioners and $20.40 a fortnight for couples combined. I want to stress to pensioners around the country that those extra payments are permanent and they will increase over time - entirely contrary to the position that was advocated by the Leader of the Opposition, repeatedly, in a deceitful way, to pensioners over many months. Those payments are permanent and will increase over time. And the only risk to that is the coalition, because the coalition is committed to taking those things off pensioners. Their position is to get rid of those payments.                 The clean energy supplements that I refer to come on top of historic reforms to the pension that are classic Labor reforms to help people who need help the most in the community. All up, a single pensioner today is receiving $207 more per fortnight than they did in September 2009 when we made significant changes. This is a massive assistance to pensioners around the country trying to cope with the cost of living. It is a massive help to people.                 As Westpac said last December, the carbon price, in fact, contrary to all the rubbish put about by the Leader of the Opposition, has had no lasting impact on the CPI, and a minimal impact compared to the introduction of the GST by the coalition. It is all in stark contrast to all of the ridiculous and ludicrous prophecies made by the coalition and its leader, the member for Warringah. When you look at the facts again, the CPI is at the bottom end of the RBA target range and stands at 2.2 per cent.                 The opposition leader has done nothing but try to harvest votes by spreading fear amongst pensioners and other members of the community in a completely gutless performance - a totally disreputable performance. Their policy position, make no mistake, is to take this money off pensioners, just as it is to take money off seven million taxpayers by cutting the tax-free threshold.

  To the member who asked the question: No. 1, he came into this parliament and voted for more boats; No. 2, this government will always take the steps necessary to protect our borders, and we do. We, in doing that, sought advice from three experts: the former chief of the Defence Force, who will know more about protecting the national security of this nation, more in his little finger, than the member who asked the question ever will across the whole of his working life; we received advice from the former chief of the Defence Force. We received advice from a refugee expert. We received advice from a highly respected foreign affairs professional, Michael L'Estrange. And we, on this side of the parliament, said, 'Let's enact that advice.'                 The member who asked the question, along with his colleagues, voted to see more boats because they thought that was in their political interest. And, having voted to see more boats, they are now in this overwhelming chaos about what to do or say next. So we have the Leader of the Opposition out there saying to the Australian people that if he is ever elected he will stop all of the boats in a number of months - he has given estimates of a number of months. Then the member who asked the question more wisely says, 'Well, you know, well, it might be, well, you know, sometime, sometime, sometime'. They are in chaos on that side of the parliament, because they know that, between the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister, they have no coherent policy on refugee and asylum seeker issues, and no coherent policy on protecting our borders.                 Instead, what they do is go around using terminology designed to incite fear. Just like for carbon pricing, this is a disreputable tactic which reflects very badly on the Leader of the Opposition. And we know that the tactics of the shadow minister have been so nauseating that even his own backbenchers stood up and said that they cannot stand them.                   The member for Cook then left the chamber.

  I thank the member for Fowler for his question. He asked me to make some comments about the Commonwealth, and I have the Commonwealth charter to table today. Today's Commonwealth is diverse and it is multifaceted. It brings together two billion people living in 54 countries, spanning all continents and major religions. From its inception the Commonwealth has been underpinned and sustained by the aspirations of its people for democratic governance, tolerance of diversity and respect for human rights. Now, for the first time in its history, the Commonwealth has a document which reflects the Commonwealth spirit - a single statement signed by Her Majesty the Queen setting out Commonwealth core values.                 This charter was a recommendation of the Eminent Persons Group, whose report was presented to Commonwealth heads of government in Perth in 2011. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Australia's representative on that Eminent Persons Group, Mr Michael Kirby, for his personal commitment to securing support for this charter. I would like to thank the foreign minister, Senator Carr, and the former foreign minister Kevin Rudd for their work in seeing the charter through to its drafting and adoption.                 The challenge now for all Commonwealth members is to promote and uphold the values set out in this charter. The future strength and unity of the Commonwealth depends on this.                 As I table this charter today we also pay tribute to the distinguished service of Queen Elizabeth as Head of the Commonwealth over these many decades. The institution of the Head of the Commonwealth, standing as it does above individual governments, has been an asset of the Commonwealth since its foundation, and we need not be reticent about its future. For Australia's part, I am sure the Queen's successor as monarch will one day serve as Head of the Commonwealth with the same distinction as Her Majesty has done.                 Speaker, today I present the Charter of the Commonwealth - an important achievement of Australia's term as Commonwealth chair in office - which has now been brought to fruition.

  As the member who asked the question well knows, the government is implementing the recommendations of the Houston review, to deal with refugee and asylum seeker issues, as the opposition continues with its relentless negativity, opposing the recommendations of those very eminent Australians. And whenever they are asked how they will vote on these recommendations they effectively say that they will vote for more boats to come to our country. So if the member is genuinely concerned about asylum seeker boats then he could use his voice in this parliament -                      As I was saying, the member who asked the question could use his voice and his vote in this parliament to send a clear signal to people smugglers. Instead, he has gone for the naked political advantage of wanting to see more boats.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question and also for her support and advocacy in this really important area. Like me, she knows that our government has worked hard to introduce real reforms, new programs and increased investment in the vital early childhood education and care sector. We know that this is providing real support for Australian families.                 On affordability, for example, we are proud to be providing record levels of financial assistance for parents to assist them with the cost of their childcare fees. We increased the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. We increased the cap on that rebate from $4,354, as it sat under those opposite, up to $7,500 per child per year. And we know that this is having a real impact.                 We know that the percentage of disposable income that an average family on $75,000 was spending on their childcare fees a year has reduced from some 13 per cent of disposable income under those opposite to just eight per cent now. Of course, that does not mean it is always easy but it does mean that this government has delivered real results in lightening the load on Australian parents. We also know that if the childcare rebate had stayed at the rate that it was at under those opposite, these very same families would be $1,787 worse off each and every year.                 Since our efforts to increase the affordability of care we have seen a massive 20 per cent increase in demand in the sector. We have also seen such growth that there are now over 1.3 million children in Australian early childhood education and care each and every year. It has been expanding at a rapid rate as a result of our affordability increases.                 But, of course, we have taken action not just on affordability but also on accessibility. We have overseen a huge expansion in the number of services and the number of places. On flexibility, we have announced trials looking at new ways that we can match up care solutions with workplace practices. On quality, just yesterday we had the opportunity to announce a $300 million Early Years Quality Fund. All of this combines to ensure that we will be spending over $23 billion over the next four years, because we know how critical this is for modern families, unlike those opposite who were spending less than a third of that in their last four years of government.                 What we are seeing here is real plans, costed policies and meaningful action from our government, which stands in stark contrast to the risk that Australian families would face if those opposite were ever elected. The opposition have announced that all of these programs, all of the assistance, all of the investment, would be up for review after the election. All of this is at risk of being taken away from Australian families that rely on this vital support.

  I wonder where Richard Torbay has got to! I have been asked a question by the Leader of the National Party about carbon pricing, which I find slightly ironic given that those opposite do not believe in carbon pricing. They certainly do not believe in an international price for carbon. So let's just dispense with that hypocrisy. Those opposite are people who will sell this country right down the drain by taking carbon pricing out of our system, which is going to deliver to this country an economic prosperity for decades to come, because you cannot be a first-class, First World economy in the 21st century unless you are efficient in the way in which you use carbon and the way in which you price it. So we on this side of the House make absolutely no apology for putting in place this very, very important reform.                 As the member knows, carbon prices depend on a range of factors, including global action and broader economic conditions, and of course there has been variance in the international price and the European price over time. International carbon prices in the four years to July 2011 traded at a range of $14 to $50. We will do what those opposite never do: we will update our budget in the normal way in May within the Charter of Budget Honesty. Those opposite have repudiated the Peter Costello Charter of Budget Honesty. They have not in five years presented one costed and funded policy before this parliament. However, after the last election they were found to have, after they ignored the Charter of Budget Honesty, an $11 billion hole in their budget bottom line, and they have got the hide to come in here and ask about fiscal responsibility and budgeting.                 The fact is that those opposite have got at least a $70 billion hole in their budget bottom line and they have a plan to slash and burn when it comes to health and education, just like Campbell Newman did. And they want to use the same approach as the LNP in Queensland. They will have a commission of audit, they will hide the truth from the people, they will go to the election and, if they are elected, suddenly the commission of audit will appear, run by someone like Peter Costello, and the next thing you know is that billions and billions of dollars are cut from health and education, and jobs are down the drain.

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. He represents one of the oldest and therefore one of the wisest electorates in this place. This is a great day for Australia's 3.5 million pensioners, including 330,000 pensioners in South Australia. About one in five South Australians today are receiving an increase: if they are a maximum-rate single pensioner it is an increase of about $35.80 per fortnight, or $54 for pensioner couples.                 This government's pension reforms have made a very real difference to the financial circumstances of Australia's pensioners. The biggest ever increase in the pension was steered through by the Minister for Families and Communities in 2009 - there were new indexation arrangements that reflect the real-life circumstances of Australia's pensioners - and the clean energy supplement was introduced and steered through by the minister for climate change. Because of these, the maximum-rate single pensioner is now $5,300 better off than they were only 3½ years ago - more than $100 per week. In South Australia, the 30,000 pensioners who live in public housing can also rest assured that they will be able to keep every single dollar of their clean energy supplement. To their shame, the governments of New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria have refused to give the same assurance to their public-housing-tenant pensioners. Instead, they will gouge 25 per cent of that clean energy supplement and plough it into their own Treasury coffers.                 I am pleased to say that, in addition to keeping a close eye on cost-of-living pressures for older Australians, this government is acting to make sure that older Australians have as much choice and as much information about their age care and support options as is possible. Later today, or perhaps tomorrow, this House will debate five bills that incorporate the government's substantial aged-care reform package, Living Longer Living Better - the most substantial reforms to our aged-care system in almost 30 years. I am pleased to say to the House that there is very strong support from the aged-care sector and from the broader community for those bills to pass the House this week in order to allow those bills to be considered in the other place, including by way of a Senate inquiry.                 I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his ongoing advocacy and support of pension reform and of aged-care reform. I also thank other members across the chamber who have shown a deep interest, over the last couple of years, in building a better aged-care system for Australia's future.

  I thank the shadow minister for his question. What a load of misrepresentative garbage, as usual, from the coalition! What absolute rubbish! The AJ Bush &amp; Sons facility is a liable entity under the carbon price. Out of the carbon price revenue, the government established a number of programs, one of which is the Clean Technology Investment Program. There are particular funds for the food processing sector. What a difference it is making to facilities in the meat industry in particular! We have spent a lot of time discussing the meat processing sector with players in the industry, working with them on the issues. With the application of simple technologies, which I have outlined on a number of occasions in question time - including the covering of settlement ponds to capture methane gas and the installation of remote-site electricity generation capacity - they are not only able to reduce -                      The grant of course has been publicly announced - quite some time ago, in fact. The shadow minister has really achieved something. He has found a press release which announces it. So I am not quite sure why he is asking.                 We have worked with that industry and, by capturing their methane emissions and installing remote-site electricity generation capacity, they can reduce their emissions significantly. Some of the facilities eliminate their carbon price liability altogether, while others significantly reduce their carbon price liability. They can generate electricity, which they can then supply to their own facility. Some meat processing facilities not only supply all their own energy but sell some into the electricity grid and gain another source of revenue. Others are investing in different technologies and are finding, as the manager of the AJ Bush &amp; Sons facility at Bromelton has found, that the carbon price is an important incentive which has a positive environmental outcome, a positive commercial outcome and makes them more competitive. Businesses, with the assistance of government working with them through the Clean Technology Investment program, are achieving those important outcomes. Why on earth would you oppose that?                 We have introduced a reform which is demonstrably economically responsible, environmentally effective and socially fair, yet all the other side of politics can do is deceive, misrepresent and run the most mendacious campaign we have ever seen. They are creating uncertainty for the business sector and uncertainty for investors in renewable energy. They are a complete farce on this issue.                 Leave not granted.

  I thank the member for Page for her important question. This government is delivering for Australian pensioners because we know pensioners have very little room to move in their budgets. Since September 2009, our pension reforms have delivered an annual increase of $5,380 for single pensioners on the maximum rate. This is important because women make up 55 per cent of the 2.3 million age pensioners and 70 per cent of all single age pensioners in Australia today are women.                 Unfortunately, older women in Australia are, on the whole, more vulnerable, having had lower incomes over their working lives and therefore, in retirement, having lower superannuation and fewer assets than men. Our government's latest increases include the clean energy supplement, as we have heard today, and the six-monthly increase. Because of our reforms, pensions are now increased twice a year to keep pace with the cost of living.                 Labor will always stand up for Australian pensioners and Labor will always stand up for Australian women. These pension reforms are in addition to other government reforms which are changing the lives of Australian women today, including our reforms to the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act to remove barriers to women's workforce participation, to promote pay equity and to increase workplace flexibility; our introduction of Australia's first ever paid parental leave scheme; our reforms to make quality child care more affordable and accessible, which we have just heard more about; and our Fair Work Australia reforms, which led to the historic equal pay case. And then there are our changes to superannuation to boost the retirement savings of women. These include tax concessions to low-income workers with salaries up to $37,000. There are 3.6 million lower-income Australians, and a large proportion of these, 2.1 million, are women. These pension reforms are the most significant reforms since Labor introduced the age pension more than 100 years ago.                 This government has a plan for fairness for Australian women during their working lives and in their retirement. This is in stark contrast to the Liberals, who we have heard want to wreck the pension and make it harder for pensioners to meet their bills. They have said they will axe the government's household assistance package, clawing back more than $1 billion in extra support that Labor is delivering to pensioners. We know those opposite -                      They have said that they are going to undo our price on carbon and that includes all the tax concessions and tax cuts that have been delivered and the increases to pensions and family payments that have occurred. We know that those opposite would have every single pensioner in Australia - as I said, 70 per cent of single age pensioners are women - lose more than $350 a year. Every pensioner couple would lose $530 a year under those opposite. The Liberals have a plan of secret cuts to pensions and jobs -

  I most certainly do not, and the suggestion is absurd. As the Leader of the Opposition well knows, during the course of today he and I, in a bipartisan spirit, have been engaged in some very important business for the Australian nation. He should also be aware that during the course of this parliamentary week, even while all eyes have been on the media debate, we have continued to govern in the interests of the nation by pursuing the legislation for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. At the same time, as a government we continue to work with Australians around the nation in making sure that we keep our economy strong and offer people the benefit of work. And it is during the last fortnight that we received the news that more than 70,000 jobs were created in our country in a month, bringing to more than 900,000 the number of jobs created since this government came to office, meaning we are well on our way to creating a million jobs.                 During the course of this week and last I have pursued what is the transformative opportunity agenda for our nation, and that is making sure that we better fund schools, that we improve schools and that we have new improvements and new resources that truly mean every Australian child gets a great education and gets the benefits of the opportunities that are coming for our nation during this the Asian century of growth and change.                 As the Leader of the Opposition may also be aware - we were certainly talking about it in question time yesterday - we have determined to keep supporting families with all the stresses and strains they face today, including cost-of-living pressures. We did that as recently as yesterday by securing new increases for 3.5 million pensioners around the country who need the support of government and would not get that support extended to them in the same way, at the same dimension, if the government were to change and if the Leader of the Opposition ever became Prime Minister given that he has said very, very clearly that he is committed to cutbacks for these Australians who need care and support the most.                 The government will continue to pursue the agenda that we have set for ourselves and the Australian nation. It is about being smarter. It is about being stronger. It is about being fairer. It is about making sure that a strong economy is ready for this century of change and growth. It is about making sure that a strong economy offers benefits to all, rather than the enrichment of just a few. And it about supporting modern families with their everyday pressures. This is the agenda that drives us, and it continues to drive us even today. We will make progress on it, so I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that the answer to his question is no.

As I understand the Leader of the Opposition's statements in recent days on DisabilityCare and on a another major item of reform in nation, our school improvement plan and school funding plan, he has been advocating that the government show over the long term how these major new programs for our nation's future, these smart investments, should be funded. I direct the Leader of the Opposition's attention to the budget when it is delivered.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question and note her commitment to her local community but in particular, as a former schoolteacher, her absolute passion in this parliament about education - a passion that I share. The government has been working hard to make sure that in our country no-one is left behind. That is why we are committed to making smart investments for our nation's future. We have been working to sign up every state and territory to start DisabilityCare in Australia, the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I can report to the parliament that we are now in a position to say such agreements have been struck to cover 90 per cent of the Australian population, and we will be working to get an agreement with the Premier of Western Australia.                 We are absolutely committed to DisabilityCare because for far too long people with disabilities in our nation and their families and carers have been subjected to a cruel lottery. The amount of assistance you got depended on where you live, the circumstances in which you got your disability and whether or not you got in before the services available had run out because they were capped and they were queued. This is a campaign for reform that has been advocated by disability groups, the disability sector, people with disabilities and their carers and families for decades. I am very proud that this government listened to the disability sector and we are now delivering DisabilityCare.                  I am also very proud that we are pursuing opportunity for every child - making sure that every child in every classroom and their teachers have their education properly resourced, not just for today's children but for the generations of children to come. I am pleased that we were able to strike an agreement with New South Wales which will see an extra $5 billion in extra funding go into the classrooms of New South Wales. We will pursue getting agreements with other states because this is right for our children and our nation's future.                 I am pleased that we have also been able to announce the Defence white paper to enter a new strategic partnership with China. All of these things are about ensuring that our economy is stronger, that our nation is smarter, that we are a fairer society. That is what guides this government. It is what will guide the budget delivered by the Treasurer tonight - stronger for the future, smarter for our children's education and fairer with DisabilityCare extended right around the country. It is plan for our nation's future, a plan we are very proud of.

  To the Leader of the Opposition: the only person volunteering an apology to Australia's pensioners should be the Leader of the Opposition because of his active plans to reduce the pensions received by Australian pensioners. Let us be absolutely clear: this is a government which has engaged in an historic increase in the pension because we wanted older Australians to be treated with dignity and with respect to get a basic level of fairness in our society, something denied to them for far too long by those opposite when they were in power.                  Come the next election, the choice for Australia's pensioners will be us continuing to invest in the aged-care pension versus the Leader of the Opposition's plan to cut back Australian pensions. The Leader of the Opposition stands for that plan just like he stands for the end of the schoolkids bonus to make families with children worse off; just like he stands for getting Australians to pay more tax by changing the tax-free threshold, putting it down, making sure Australians pay more tax; just like he stands for the eradication of the low-income superannuation contribution so more than three million low-income Australians - predominantly women - miss out. That is not the government's way.                  The government's way, as will be shown in this budget, is to ensure that we protect jobs and growth, that we chart a path to surplus, that we make the smart investments for the future and that we continue to work with Australians to support them with the services they need. The debate in Australian politics today is between that plan and that vision of the future and the Leader of the Opposition's plan to cut to the bone - to cut the services that Australians need, to put our economy into a standstill as a result of that reckless austerity and those cuts. The Leader of the Opposition will have an opportunity on Thursday night to outline the details of his plans to cut Australian services to the bone, to rip away from Australians the supports that they need.                  For the government's budget tonight, what you will see is a government focussed on jobs and growth, proud that we have created around 950,000 jobs since we came to office, proud that we have worked for decency for working conditions in those jobs, proud that we have increased pensions, proud that we have worked with Australian families through things like the schoolkids bonus and increasing the tax-free threshold so that they have more supports than they used to under the former government. There is a choice, there is a contrast here. It is a very clear one and I hope the Leader of the Opposition details his on Thursday night.

  I want to thank the member for Banks for that question because we think that investing in education is the most important investment that a nation can make. We know that education is the great enabler. For young Australians to live a successful and happy life the quality of their education will count. For us to have young Australians who are well educated and get high-paid, high-skilled jobs in the future will contribute to our national prosperity over time.                  Education has been front and centre of this government's agenda and remains there. Look at what we have done already. For the first time we have a national curriculum. For the first time there will be over one million students sitting NAPLAN today, national testing in literacy and numeracy. We have the MySchool website and have improved facilities in every school in the country, especially focusing effort on the things that we know count in the school and in the classroom. That is about teacher quality and making sure our kids are learning to read and do their maths well at an early age.                  But we know there is more to do. The Gonski panel, who looked at school funding, provided us with a set of recommendations that said that we need to fund schools on a basis that is fair and on a basis that is effective. We have accepted the thrust of those recommendations and we have a National Plan for School Improvement, with the goal to have Australia in the top five education nations in the world by 2025. We are backing that plan with effectively a '$2 from the Commonwealth and $1 from the state' investment that would see some $14.5 billion in additional funding exercised and spent over time to make sure that every student, no matter where they live and no matter how much money their parents earn, is getting the education that they need.                 I am asked about how the National Plan for School Improvement has been received. The fact is it has been received very positively. I can hardly find a person in the country who thinks and cares about education who has not been positive about this reform - teachers, parents and the business community. New South Wales, as the Prime Minister has said, have agreed in the interests of their students that the National Plan for School Improvement is something that they want to be a part of. In fact, the New South Wales Premier said:                 _ it provides additional resources, fairer distribution, to deliver higher standards and better outcomes _                 I do not agree with everything that Premier O'Farrell says or does, but on this count I think he got it right. The only negative voices we have heard are from the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister. The Leader of the Opposition thinks that increasing investment to public education is an injustice. They will not support this national plan for the nation's future.

  Thank you to the member for his question. The question goes to matters that will be the subject of the budget this evening. Of course, I make the point that this is a government that regularly engages in consultation with all relevant stakeholders. It might come as a surprise to some on the other side, but that is a very reasonable way to engage in a systematic process of policy review.                 The question goes very directly to the question of profit-shifting activities. This has been an area that I have spoken about at length. The government has absolutely no time for multinational enterprises that are engaged in profit-shifting activity - and, indeed, this is a debate that has been occurring not just in this country but all around the world.                 I do make the point that, when it comes to cracking down on loopholes and protecting the corporate tax base, this government has taken some very, very strenuous measures in order to protect the revenue base. In doing so, I make the point that we have put in place measures, or brought measures into the parliament, that have sought to protect the revenue to the tune of $11 billion.                     Thank you very much, Speaker. I can understand the concern. I am simply pointing out that each of those measures that have protected $11 billion worth of revenue has been opposed by the opposition. I think that there are many mums and dads all around Australia that would want to ask the question: why is it that, on every occasion that this government has brought forward measures to crack down on multinational profit shifting, they have come into this place and voted against those measures?                     In terms of the measures that will be the subject of announcement tonight, you will have to wait till 7.30.

  I thank very much the member for his question and for his ongoing representations about the needs of people on the Sunshine Coast, particularly with regard to roads funding. Earlier this year, of course, I announced some $80 million in funding for a new interchange between the Bruce Highway, Roys Road and Bells Creek Road, and last month the Prime Minister and I were in Rockhampton with the member for Capricornia announcing our $4.1 billion plan for a better, safer Bruce Highway. That is real money for real projects that will make a real difference to local communities along the highway. On the Sunshine Coast, this will see the construction of a new flyover ramp to the Bruce Highway from the Sunshine Motorway. It will significantly improve safety and reduce congestion for people travelling on the Bruce Highway. It will also mean we can fast-track the next stage of Cooroy to Curra upgrade section A, where construction is on track to start next month. We have allocated $4.1 billion, making a total of $5.7 billion - four times what those opposite allocated when they were in government. We can do a range of projects that have been outlined, but we can do even more if the Queensland government comes to the party and puts up its fair share of funding, including widening the highway between Caboolture and the Sunshine Coast.                 Three months ago, the opposition leader said that he would be making very substantial announcements about the Bruce Highway in coming weeks. That was three months ago. All we have heard since is radio silence, which is not surprising given the embarrassment of $1.3 billion over 12 long years of neglect that occurred under the former government. What this government has is a plan for our national road network that is about supporting jobs today through construction but also about making those productivity improvements - including, in the Sunshine Coast region just to the north, the Cooroy to Curra section B that was promised, funded, built and opened by this government after the former transport minister and local member to the north of Mr Slipper's electorate described it as the worst section of road in Australia. Those opposite have been driving up and down the highway but not making any commitments at all - no commitments. The Leader of the National Party said $8 billion one day, and then it went back to $1 billion under Joe Hockey, the shadow Treasurer. And now we know that they are saying no commitment at all.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I know that he is very committed to a fair go all round at work.                 In the election on 14 September there will be a choice between two different sets of policies about the future of Australian workplaces and good jobs. There is one choice - the Labor way - where people can expect and deserve good jobs. We see that happening every day in Australia, with fairer and better laws under the Fair Work Act. I am pleased to report to the House that labour productivity has been up - not for one quarter, not two quarters, not three quarters - for seven quarters in a row. I am pleased to report that last Thursday, the April unemployment numbers fell. An fact, in April, there were more men and women in Australia working full-time than ever in the history of Federation.                 I am also pleased to report that under the 5½ years of Labor, industrial action lost time has fallen and has been substantially lower than the 11 years of the Liberal period beforehand. I am also pleased to report that wage growth is reasonable. So there you have it. That is the Labor choice: productivity up, jobs up, industrial action down and wages moving reasonably.                 I am asked if there is another choice, another set of policies. Last Thursday, after pressure, the Liberal Party revealed a bit of a sticky taped together, stapled set of press releases from employer groups and proudly brandished it as a workplace relations policy. I do congratulate the opposition policy for being classic, textbook small target: say nothing - or nearly nothing. Hope that we can say and do nothing, even though some of the hard-line right-wingers behind the Leader of the Opposition want to let loose. They want to sneak into office as they did in 2004 - by not telling anyone anything.                    Unfortunately, Liberal Party policy does let the cat out of the proverbial bag. Unfair individual contracts are back with a bullet under the Liberals. They are now proposing - I love this, I do not know who dreamed it up, but they deserve a medal for idiocy - to make law that you can swap your hourly pay for non-monetary benefits. Why didn't we think of that? What a great idea! What you can now do is take a pay cut if you vote Liberal. Fantastic! But it goes further than that. Unfair individual contracts are in the Liberal Party DNA. Look how happy other people are. The Liberals are saying that there is nothing here to see. Why did the Australian Retailers Association today come out and say, 'Good on the Liberal Party of Australia, because we can get our teeth into penalty rates'? Indeed, I have to respect the honesty of the oracle from Goldstein, because on the radio today, as the oracle does -

  As I said in my earlier answer, the government regularly engages in consultation with all manner of stakeholders, and that is entirely appropriate. I can indicate -                      throughout the course of any consultations, we are always very mindful of ensuring that no individual stakeholder obtains any advantage as a consequence of those consultations. That is appropriate, and that is the way in which we have conducted our discussions with stakeholders.

  I thank the member for Bendigo for his question. It is indeed the case that this government has an orderly plan for investment in the nation's infrastructure. That is why we established Infrastructure Australia to give us advice based upon cost-benefit analysis about projects, regardless of the mode. That is why it is important that we have invested, not just doubling the roads budget, but we have committed more to urban public transport than all governments combined from Federation right through to 2007. That includes, of course, in the honourable member's electorate, the Regional Rail Link, which will benefit Melbourne, but will also benefit Bendigo, Ballarat and Geelong. It is the largest single investment in urban public transport in Australia's history by any federal government.                  We have not just done that. Of course, we have also had the Noarlunga to Seaford extension in Adelaide that will open later this year. We have also had the Gold Coast Rapid Transit line that is going gangbusters on the Gold Coast and will be finished by 2014. We have got the Perth Citylink project, in Perth, sinking the existing rail line through the CBD and uniting the CBD with Northbridge, transforming the city of Perth with federal investment. In Brisbane, to the north, we have the Moreton Bay regional rail link, which is also underway. We also have projects of separating freight from passenger lines that are leading to a better urban public transport system in Sydney: the Southern Sydney Freight Line, which I opened earlier this year, and the Northern Sydney Freight Line, making a big difference, where construction will start at Strathfield in coming months. Also, in Adelaide, we have the Goodwood and Torrens junctions grade separation. In addition to that, we have had money for planning: planning of the Melbourne Metro, planning of the Brisbane Cross River Rail project - important investments - as well as, in Perth, the light rail project. It is important that this occur and it has been received well by those Australians who are stuck in traffic gridlock, who know that we need to invest in urban public transport.                    What those opposite have had to say is that we need to stick to their knitting, that we need to abandon any investment in urban public transport whatsoever. It has been ruled out by the Leader of the Opposition - and not just that. He went on Melbourne radio and said the only urban rail project that he can recall that the Commonwealth has substantially funded is the Moreton Link in Brisbane. It was on radio in Melbourne, where 2½ thousand people are at work today on the Regional Rail Link, 2½ thousand jobs ensuring growth into the future - and he was not even aware of it.

  I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition - and indeed all members of the House - need to grapple with the facts and what the facts mean for the government's budget position and would mean for anyone who was in government at this period of time. You cannot wish away the facts, and what the facts mean is that, since the budget was last delivered, we have seen the amount of revenue tax money expected to be received by the government go down by $17 billion. In those circumstances the government is making responsible savings. As I indicated to the Australian people when I spoke about this matter a few weeks ago, these decisions are grave and weighty ones, but we are determined to take the right decisions to ensure that we have a focus on jobs and growth, that we chart a pathway to surplus and that we are making the smart investments necessary for the nation's future. That is the approach that the government has taken, and of course on election day Australians will have the opportunity to judge that approach versus the approach of the opposition to cut to the bone. I note that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did not come to the dispatch box and spruik about the opposition's plan to rip away the Schoolkids Bonus from Australian families, to make Australian families with school children worse off and to take the money out of their purses and wallets that they are using to support the costs of getting the kids to school. I note that she did not come to the dispatch box and say that they are planning to put up tax. They want people to pay more tax, particularly working women, because, whilst we have increased the tax-free threshold so a million Australians have come out of the tax system, so that you do not pay tax now until you earn more than $18,200 -                      I understand that it is uncomfortable for the opposition, but they should be very clear with the Australian people that they stand for increased tax, they stand for ripping off the Schoolkids Bonus and they have got $70 billion of cutbacks coming to essential services in health and education, because that is the liberal way. The government stands by the choices we have made in preparation for this budget: choices focused on jobs and growth, choices focused on getting our nation ready for the future.

  I thank the member for his question and acknowledge his longstanding interest in national security matters, particularly our maritime security and the capability of Adelaide to be at the heart and centre of that.                  The Prime Minister and I released the Defence white paper on 3 May and that provides the strategic analysis which fits Australia for our future national security challenges. The strategic analysis in the white paper has been widely regarded as a sensible and careful analysis of those future challenges and risks. It provides a road map for us to protect and enhance Australia's national security interests.                 The white paper outlines, in the government's view, the formation of a new strategic entity which we describe as the Indo-Pacific. This reflects not just the rise of China but also the rise of India. The paper draws attention to the essential need for the United States-China relationship to be a positive and productive one, and particularly for that relationship to grow from an economic relationship to a relationship at the same level in the political, strategic, defence-to-defence and military-to-military area.                 We also acknowledged the importance of the United States rebalance and some of the current issues facing Australia: a drawdown from Afghanistan, Timor Leste and the Solomons, and our own force posture review reflected by the first force posture review in over 25 years.                 And so the strategic analysis sets out those challenges. The capability decisions made in the white paper allow the Australian Defence Force, the ADF, to meet those challenges for the future and to discharge the obligations given to it by the government. The two primary decisions made in the white paper so far as capability is concerned are the purchase of 12 off-the-production-line Growler electronic warfare capability aircraft to add to our 24 Super Hornets and to our 71 classic Hornets and, importantly, a narrowing of our capability decision so far as our 12 submarines to be assembled in South Australia are concerned: to an evolved Collins model or to a brand-new design - in contrast to those opposite, through their shadow minister, who look only at an off-the-shelf foreign purchase.                 I have seen a lot of comment made about finance in this area. The white paper does respond to the adverse implications of the global financial crisis. I have also seen reference that the fact that we are not currently at two per cent of GDP spending creates a crisis in defence spending. We remain the 13th largest defence spender, and if you think there is a crisis in defence spending because we are not at two per cent of GDP then I regret to advise the House that we have had that crisis since 1999. We have not had two per cent of GDP since that time. We have an aspiration to go to two per cent, but we have a bipartisanship approach here to defence spending: everyone has an aspiration to two per cent, but that has not been met in reality since 1999.

  In answer to the Leader of the National Party's question: I am very concerned to be working with Australian families on their cost-of-living pressures, which is why we provided the Schoolkids Bonus, a benefit provided by Labor to help with the costs of getting the kids to school. If you have two kids going to school, across their schooling careers it will make a difference of $15,000 for a family. And who wants to take that away? None other than the Leader of the Opposition.                 Then, of course, we are working with Australian families on cost-of-living pressures that they face - for example, the historic increase in the pension that this government has delivered because we understand that for Australian pensioners it is hard to make ends meet. And who wants to take a pension increase away? None other than the Leader of the Opposition.                 Then, of course, there are the supports that this government has put in place for child care: moving from the system of the former government, that the Leader of the National Party was involved in, and increasing the childcare rebate so that there is more support for childcare expenses for Australian families than there has ever been before. And there is the Leader of the Opposition saying that he is going to have a scheme for nannies that he is going to fund from that money that currently goes to families. All that means is that there are going to be cutbacks for families that are getting childcare benefit and childcare tax rebate now.                 Then, of course, we work with families too on cost-of-living pressures by ensuring that families get the benefits of tax cuts through increasing the tax-free threshold to $18,200, taking a million Australians out of the tax system and giving millions more tax relief. Because of the structure of this tax-free threshold, this is a benefit that makes a difference particularly for working women; particularly for women, for second-income earners, who are seeking to combine part-time work with caring for children. And who wants to take that benefit away, and ensure that those low-income Australians - those working women, predominantly - pay more tax? None other than the Leader of the Opposition. Then on my statements about support for -                      The question put to me a quote of mine and I am referring to that part of the question, so the member for Sturt might want to see the questions drawn more tightly if he is not liking the answer.                 Then last, of course, in terms of support for families: I am very proud that we are standing alongside more than three million low-income earners to increase their superannuation - something that the Leader of the Opposition would take away. So if the Leader of the National Party is truly concerned about cost-of-living questions in Australian families, have a chat with him: he is the one who wants to cut to the bone.

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question. I know she has a very long-standing interest and strong track record in developing productive partnerships between federal government and local governments for the benefit of local communities. The member for Greenway was, of course, the Deputy Mayor of Blacktown before standing to represent her community in our federal parliament.                 Since 1901 the Constitution has served Australia very well but we must ensure that it remains a living and a relevant document, one which reflects the reality of government and the provision of essential community services in Australia. The proposed change to section 96 of the Constitution is a modest and a practical change. Section 96, of course, currently allows the granting of financial assistance to any state on such terms and conditions as the parliament sees fit. The proposed amendment would simply acknowledge the fact that the Commonwealth has partnered with local governments for decades to deliver local roads, sporting fields, libraries, child care and vital community services. The roads that we drive down every day, the football fields, the new changing sheds that our kids use on the weekends, the modern learning centres that are being built in new suburbs - many of these have been made possible by local and federal governments working together.                 I also want to make clear what this amendment does not do. It does not give the Commonwealth any ability to interfere with the creation or regulation of local government bodies by the states. The proposed change of course follows extensive consultation and development by the expert panel convened in 2011 and chaired by Jim Spigelman. It was endorsed by a joint select committee chaired by the member for Greenway and supported by members of parliament from across politics.                 History shows that only a referendum with bipartisan federal support has any chance of being agreed at the ballot box on 14 September, and we therefore welcome the support of the opposition for this practical change to our Constitution and look forward to working with the opposition members to explain this change to the people of Australia. National Party members in particular understand the benefits arising from partnerships between federal government and local governments which serve to develop and strengthen their electorates. So let's work together with the Australian people to say yes to recognising local government in our Constitution.

  I thank the member for his question and I thank him for his frankness on workplace relations policy, where at least he has said unashamedly and proudly, 'You can't have genuine flexibility without a form of statutory individual contracts with a no disadvantage test.' He is still a believer in Work Choices and prepared to spruik that long and loud, unlike the Leader of the Opposition, who is still a believer in Work -                      I am asked by the member about tonight's budget. The member will see tonight's budget when the Treasurer delivers it at 7:30 tonight, and what I can assure the member is that it is a budget based on the facts, right for these economic circumstances, focused on jobs as this government has always been focused on jobs - 960,000 jobs, almost a million, created since this government came to office, an economy 13 per cent larger despite having to face the biggest economic shock the globe has seen since the Great Depression. Despite having to see that, we have put in place policies to support jobs.                 I say to the member: if he is interested in the budget then he should direct his attention to the budget tonight, but when he does so he ought to take an approach based on the facts. The member opposite and, indeed, all those members opposite might be interested to know that former Prime Minister Howard was prepared to take an approach based on the facts when it comes to tonight's budget and, indeed, the government's budget in general. He said on 13 May, very recently:                 When the current prime minister and the treasurer and others tell you that the Australian economy is doing better than most  -  they are right.                 We are still fortunate that we have an unemployment rate with a five in front of it. I wouldn't have thought that was going to be possible a couple of years ago, and I don't think many people would have. Our unemployment has remained pleasingly quite low.                 Former Prime Minister Howard went on to say:                 And our debt to GDP ratio, the amount of money we owe to the strength of our economy, is still a lot better than most other countries.                 So the member, who worked as an adviser for former Prime Minister Howard, may want to note -                    The member for Mayo then left the chamber.                     that there is former Prime Minister Howard acknowledging our economy is strong, acknowledging that we have jobs in our economy and acknowledging that we have low debt. They are the facts of the Australian economy, and no amount of yelling and screeching from those opposite will ever change those facts.

  I want to thank the member for Lyons for asking a question about an issue that we have been talking about all term in here as to whether or not we could get the stakeholders from each side of the Tasmanian forestry debate to agree and then whether we could get that agreement to go through the Tasmanian parliament. I am very pleased to say that since this parliament last met the forestry deal has been endorsed by the Tasmanian parliament and is now being rolled out. This is something that ends 30 years of conflict in Tasmanian forestry and has extraordinary outcomes for both Tasmanian jobs and conservation.                 We have had a significant shift in the forestry industry for some time now. Markets that we used to be able to rely on started to disappear or demand that they would only buy timber product, whether it be woodchip, peeler billet or sawlog, if it had the Forest Stewardship Council certification on it. None of the native forestry run by Forestry Tasmania was eligible at that point for FSC certification. Now, with the agreement in place, we are seeing the process for certification for the export of timber products from Tasmania moving quickly.                 Tasmania will be leading the nation. It will be the one state whose official forestry body has gained Forest Stewardship Council certification and which has opened itself up to those export markets around the world. On the different exit packages that have been offered I have heard the comments of the Leader of the Opposition, who has said that his side of politics would never pay people to leave, completely forgetting the exit packages over the years, pretending they never happened. What will occur is where people have already seen the massive drop-off in demand they now have an opportunity to take up that slack through the exit packages and then reinvest in their businesses. This is a good outcome for jobs in Tasmania. This opens Tasmanian forestry products back up to the world. At the same time it means that conservation outcomes that previously would have been thought to be completely unattainable are now possible. We now have in the order of half a million hectares of forestry reserves coming into place, taking in some areas within the Tarkine, areas such as the Blue Tier. But the most highly contested forests, areas like the Weld, the Styx and the Upper Florentine, are currently before the World Heritage Committee in Paris to enable them to get the full level of conservation protection and to be put on the World Heritage List.                 This is something where the conflict options that have been there for the last 30 years have been entirely rejected by this government. We have worked with stakeholders, with the Tasmanian people, who have wanted to move to a future that is very different from the past with a combination of conservation and jobs.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. What you need to do as Prime Minister is deal with the facts, and the facts are, of course, that in our economy we have seen circumstances that have led to very large revenue write-downs - that is, less tax money coming into the government than was expected. That is as a result of the combination of the hangover from the global financial crisis and the high Australian dollar and its impact on the Australian economy, particularly on company profitability. If companies are less profitable then they are paying less tax. I think many Australians, from a common-sense point of view, know that to be the case.                 To the Leader of the Opposition I say that what budgets are about is accepting the facts and then showing your choices - showing the choices that you stand by and believe in. What the government has done in this budget is continue our focus on jobs and growth. The Leader of the Opposition may be saying to the Australian community that somehow he could make a magic difference here, but in fact you need to wrestle in detail with budgets. So the Leader of the Opposition appears to be saying to the Australian community that what he would do instead of the government's strategy is cut to the bone, with all of the implications that would have for Australian families who would see healthcare services slashed, education slashed, family payments slashed, the aged-care pension slashed - and the list goes on. Indeed, today the Leader of the Opposition has been out confirming very loudly that he would not back the government's new investments into schools. That means that the Leader of the Opposition stands for taking half a million dollars, on average, out of every Australian school.                 The Leader of the Opposition this morning was wandering around saying that this was a budget that had no hope in it. Well, to the Leader of the Opposition I say: go out of Parliament House and meet the families of people who are caring for people with disabilities, or people with disabilities themselves. Go and meet with them and ask what they think about this budget, delivering as it does on DisabilityCare fully funded for 10 years. Go and walk into a classroom and see what a combination of great teaching and new resources can do for a child's life, and tell them that there is no hope in this budget when this budget fully delivers on our school improvement agenda over 10 years. This is a budget for the Australian people, right for these economic circumstances, and I absolutely reject the Leader of the Opposition's strategy to cut to the bone.

  I thank the member for his question, because the budget I announced last night does make our economy stronger, our nation smarter and our society fairer. That is because we on this side of the House have made a fundamental choice to support growth in jobs and a transitional period in our economy and to do it in the face of very significant tax revenue write-downs, because the alternative would be the one put forward by those opposite: big cuts to the bone in health and education. This is not something those on this side of the House will contemplate. We will support growth and jobs in our economy, and that is what we are doing with our budget. We are building on the resilience and strength of the Australian economy.                     Our economy is now 13 per cent larger than it was prior to the global financial crisis. Why is that so? Because of the policies we put in place to support demand in our economy in the face of the global financial crisis and the global recession. The consequence of that is that we did not go into recession like most other developed economies, and we are far stronger for it. We have created over 950,000 jobs in this country during our period in office. And, of course, we have a AAA credit rating from the three major global rating agencies, confirmed again last night by those rating agencies.                 So this budget is all about a sustainable path to surplus, supporting jobs and growth and making the investments, particularly the smart investments which will drive productivity in our economy for the future - the investments the Prime Minister was talking about before. The investments in school improvement are absolutely critical not just to making sure that no child is left behind but also to lifting our productivity for the long term. Then, of course, there is the sustainable funding of DisabilityCare, a very big initiative from this government.                 That is why I was so disappointed to see this morning that the shadow Treasurer said there was no hope in the budget. Tell that to the 460,000 people with permanent disabilities in this country: 'No hope in the budget.' Tell that to the people who are in employment: 'No hope in the budget.' What this actually shows is that those opposite do not have a clue as to what they are doing when it comes to economic policy.                 On this side of the House we have a record of getting the big economic calls right. We are doing it again to support jobs and growth in our economy.

  What we have here from the shadow Treasurer is the fiscal fearmongering campaign writ large. What we have here is a situation where net debt peaks at 11.4 per cent in 2014 - a very modest level of debt, particularly compared to other developed economies.                 I have been asked by the shadow Treasurer about the debt cap. Well, the answer to that is it is not necessary to do anything about the debt cap at all but we will review it in the usual way and, if it were necessary, we would lift it.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question and for her continued focus on the interests of her constituents. As a former small business person in this parliament, she is very focused on her local economy, jobs and opportunity. I can reassure her and say to the whole parliament that the budget we delivered last night is focused on building a stronger, fairer and smarter Australia.                 By stronger, of course, I mean a strengthening economy. We have avoided recession. We have avoided the worst of the global financial crisis. If you compare our nation with the United States and nations in Europe, unlike those nations, we kept people in jobs. We kept people working; we focused on jobs. We focused on growth, which is why our economy is 13 per cent bigger now, and we are able to point to more than 950,000 jobs created during some of the worst economic times that the world has ever seen - the worst economic event since the Great Depression. We are a country AAA credit rated by all three major ratings agencies - only one of eight countries to be so and something not achieved under the former government.                 In the budget we have laid out a plan to keep strengthening our economy - a sustainable path to surplus, investing in the infrastructure we need for the future; $24 billion for the next wave of infrastructure and Labor's National Broadband Network, which is the only real way of getting fibre where it is needed, to homes and businesses. At the same time we are ensuring that we are a smarter country for the future. I want every Australian child to realise their full opportunity. That is right for our children and it is right for our nation's future. We cannot be a strong nation in the future, with high-skill, high-wage jobs, unless we invest in our schools and get our kids a world-class education. In this budget we properly fund this for the next 10 years.                 In this budget not only are we giving hope to schoolchildren; we are giving hope to Australians with disabilities, their families and their carers by showing the way in which DisabilityCare can be fully funded over the next 10 years. We have made these choices which show our values - what we believe needs to be delivered for the Australian people. They have not always been easy choices, but they are the right choices to build the future that Australians deserve.                 Budgets are about choices. They are about laying out what you believe in front of the Australian people. The government did that last night; the opposition will have its opportunity to do so tomorrow night.

  I am more than happy to read out the figures from the budget papers. Gross debt or net debt - what would you like?                     Gross debt in 2012-13 is $292.8 million; in 2013-14, $321.3 million; in 2014-15, $345 million; and the peak, at 20.2, is $356 million. But the point I was making earlier -                      That is the market value, not the face value, on issue. I know he wants to try to confuse this because he wants to be a fiscal fearmonger, ape the tactics of the Tea Party in the United States and run around the place saying that the debt is unsustainable.                 Net debt is low at 11.1 per cent of GDP. It is like someone with an income of $100,000 owing less than $12,000. Debt is modest in this country and we have it to support jobs and growth. So, when he is asking these sorts of questions, what he is really saying is that his alternative to these modest levels of debt - supporting jobs and growth in our economy - is to take an axe to jobs, growth, health and education. That is not something this Labor government would ever do but it is something those opposite would do, because it was the path they put forward during the global financial crisis - and if they had had their way this country would have gone into recession.

  I thank the member for Greenway very much for her question and for her dedication to this issue in her electorate. This budget does deliver a fairer deal, particularly for people with disability and also for their families and carers. It provides the hope for those Australians who know that, at some time in the future, they too may be affected by disability. They may be affected or their loved ones may be affected. In this budget we want to end the cruel lottery that has faced so many people with disability over such a long period of time - the cruel lottery that has said, 'The level of care or support that you receive depends on where you live or how you got your disability.'                 This budget is all about making sure that we do have a fairer nation. As Dr Ken Baker, from National Disability Services, has said today:                  This Budget is the first to make disability support its centrepiece.                 We have made the choice and it is a choice. As the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have made clear, both yesterday and today, budgets are about choices and a choice that the government have made is to put disability care at the centre of our concerns.                 We have also made the choice to create a strong and stable funding stream right out into the future so that people with a disability, their carers and their families can see that the commitment this government is making for their care and support is funded well into the future - in fact, for 10 years to come.                 In just a few weeks, on 1 July, the government will launch DisabilityCare Australia. It is a very, very exciting time. The first stage of the National Disability Insurance Scheme will see 26,000 people, in different launch sites around the country, start to come into DisabilityCare Australia, start to receive the care and support that people really need. That is why it was so disappointing to see the Leader of the Opposition say today that there was no hope in this budget. There is hope at the centre of this budget: hope for people with a disability, hope for their carers and families that they have never had before.

  Here we go! He is going to redefine the way the accounting is done in the budget. He wants to rely not on the underlying cash level, he wants to do the headline cash level. But that is not something you ever did in government. All we are doing is accounting for the operation of bodies like the NBN -                      EFIC, Australia Post and other organisations in the same way that the Howard government accounted for them. That is what is going on. But what we have seen with this question, like we saw with the previous question, is the coalition's fiscal fearmongering. They want to go out there and grossly exaggerate the amount of debt we have got in our economy, which is modest. We have got net debt at 11.1 per cent of GDP. That is like someone with $100,000 worth of income owing less than $12,000. It is a modest level of debt and we have it because we are supporting jobs and our economy when it is needed. But their position is really clear because, when they ask these questions, what they are really saying is: 'You shouldn't have done that. What you should have done is take an axe to the budget and an axe to jobs.' Just because the global economy takes an axe to our revenues, we are not going to take an axe to jobs like you would. We are not going to do that.                 We have a modest level of debt. It is a buffer because our revenues have been written down to support our economy, and everyone on this side of the House is proud of that, proud that we are supporting our economy, proud that we are supporting jobs, proud that this government has got the guts to get behind our economy and proud that we do not go down the austerity route that those opposite want to go down with all of their fiscal fearmongering and all of the consequences that come with it. When they are going on about debt, what they are really on about is their subterranean agenda to take an axe to the social safety net. That is what they are on about, and that is what his speech to the IPA was all about: do some fiscal fearmongering to set the scene to slash health and education, to cut to the bone. There is a very clear choice following this budget, and Australians will know what it is.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question, knowing her strong commitment to education in her electorate. The fact is that last night's budget placed caring for Australians in the future front and centre of the agenda of this government and ensured that young Australians and those with disability have hope in the years to come. Let's not forget: in this country year-9 students from the poorest quarter of Australian families are on average three years of schooling behind students from the wealthiest quarter. Let's not forget that, despite some pockets of success, we have slipped globally in our international standings. Our neighbours are pulling away while we are standing still. We on this side of the House know that a good education can be the difference between getting the high-skilled jobs of the 21st century or being left behind, and that is why we made the smart education investments in last night's budget: $9.8 billion to drive the reforms in the National Plan for School Improvement, an investment I know everyone on this side of the chamber is proud of.                 I am asked about reactions, and I cannot say the same for the conservative side of politics. There are some exceptions, as I said yesterday; I do not agree with everything Premier O'Farrell says, but on the plan for school improvement he is pretty correct. It provides additional resources and fairer distribution to deliver higher standards and better outcomes in schools across New South Wales.                 Unfortunately for the schoolchildren of the nation, the Leader of the Opposition does not share this vision. There he was again on Sunrise this morning with Kochie, who gave him another chance to discard the lycra and put the politics aside; but, true to form, the Leader of the Opposition went negative. The host says: 'You have time to think about this - the whole Gonski report, the education funding. New South Wales has already signed up. Will you keep the deal?' Mr Abbott: 'Well, we don't know what the deal is.' It is no surprise there that he has not bothered to read something again, but Kochie was surprised. He said, 'You haven't rung your mate Barry O'Farrell - he's in the next electorate to you - and said, 'What's the details?'' The Leader of the Opposition: 'We're not going to sign up to anything were not convinced is a good deal.'                 Look at the contrast: a conservative premier who sees the importance of education, understands how the National Plan for School Improvement works and has signed up to it to deliver an extra $5 billion to students in that state versus the Leader of the Opposition here, who thinks the injustice in the education system is that public schools get too much funding, has not even read the National Plan for School Improvement and sees no hope in a budget that delivers $9.8 billion in extra investment for schools around the nation.

  I do thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. We should first of all start with revenue and then go on to expenditure, because those opposite claim there has been no revenue write-down. They would be receiving, if they were in government, the same advice that we are receiving, which is that for 2012-13 we have had a revenue write-down of $17 billion and larger ones over the next two years. They would receive that advice from the Treasury, but they claim that that has not happened. It is just like the global financial crisis: it never happened. And now the revenue write-downs have not happened.                 Then, to go on with their fiction, they run around the place with a whole lot of figures that exaggerate spending. One of their criticisms is that we now spend $100 billion more in our budget than was spent when we came to government - ignoring the fact that the economy is 13 per cent bigger. The fact is that economies grow, but when it comes to our spending levels our spending levels as a proportion of GDP are about on an average with where they were when you were in government. But you insist, like you do with debt, on the spending side of the budget to go around and make all these extreme exaggerations. The reason you are doing it is that you are not going to put your policies out before the election. You want to be able to run around and claim: 'Oh, there's a spending problem. There's no revenue problem,' and try to get through an election campaign like Campbell Newman. If you get elected then you will slash and burn. That is what all of this is about.                     If you look at the facts - if we get them out there on the table - what they will show is that our expenditure levels are broadly, as a percentage of GDP, where they were when that mob over there were in government. So much for the spending problem. These are figures which are easily available. They are there, but they choose once again to exaggerate what is going on. We over the forward estimates have got spending growth of, on average, 1.1 per cent.                     I will just conclude with this one fact: the tax to GDP ratio this year is 21.5 per cent. When we were elected, the level we inherited from those opposite was 23.7 per cent. If we had that tax to GDP ratio that we inherited from them, that they had when they were last in government, we would be running a surplus of $6 billion and we would have increased revenue of $24 billion this year. That proves the fact there is a big revenue challenge. That is why we have taken the decisions we had to take: absolutely necessary to support jobs and growth. And God help us what would have happened if they were in government in these circumstances, because they would have slashed and burned, austerity for austerity's sake. They subscribe to the theory that you can cut your way to growth. Well, you cannot. That is what has happened in Europe, it proves that is wrong, but they have been captured by the mad Tea Party elements of the Liberal Party and the IPA.

  I thank the member for Moreton for his question and his ongoing support, particularly for the Cross River Rail project in Brisbane. This federal government has overhauled the way that the nation plans, finances and builds our infrastructure. We assess projects on the basis of Infrastructure Australia's advice, undertake cost-benefit analysis and work with state and territory governments to make sure that projects can be delivered. In terms of urban public transport, last night we announced the single biggest ever commitment to urban public transport by any federal government and it builds on the record funding where we have committed more to urban public transport since 2007 than all governments combined.                  In Brisbane, the Cross River Rail project is an absolute priority. As requested by the Queensland government, we have made an allocation of $715 million, to be matched by the Queensland government, with further support from future availability payments. This will open up services from Brisbane's north and western suburbs as well as the Sunshine and Gold coasts, and the project will make sure that an extra 17,000 people can travel on Brisbane's rail system during the peak periods. Being surprised by some of the Queensland treasurer's comments, I asked my department and Infrastructure Australia for some of the correspondence. That is what we have got; that is the work that has been done; that is how you do proper infrastructure development and funding.                      That is how we have complied with the requests of the Queensland government. In Melbourne, the Melbourne Metro project will similarly untangle the inner core of the rail network and open it up for the future. After ongoing discussions with the Victorian government, and in accordance with their requests, the budget allocated $3 billion for the Melbourne Metro project. Minister Mulder, the transport minister, said on Sunday, and I quote: 'It is our No.1 transport priority.' It will make sure that an extra 20,000 people an hour can travel on the Melbourne rail network. You cannot do an airport link, you cannot do an Avalon rail link, you cannot do the Doncaster rail line, you cannot solve Melbourne's congestion problems without this link. Here is the correspondence between the government, the private sector, Infrastructure Australia and the Victorian government outlining their requests for funding. We have a plan to support jobs and growth, to support public transport and to support our road infrastructure.

  I am delighted to answer that question, because we on this side of the House are very big supporters of resource rent taxation. Indeed the PRRT, which was opposed by those opposite, has worked over time and raised something like $28 billion. It is true that the introduction of the MRRT has coincided with the biggest fall in the terms of trade that we have seen in years - 17 per cent - and that commodity prices did crash, so it is not surprising that when you have a super profits tax little tax is paid when there are no super profits. That is just common sense.                 But I was asked about the forward estimates. I do not know where he got his from, but over the forward estimates it is estimated that it will raise $5.5 billion. That is what is estimated at the moment and, if you go through, it does move up as a result of improving conditions over the forward estimates. But it is not a surprise that at the moment, because of what occurred with commodity prices and our terms of trade at the end of last year, revenue should be substantially down now. That is what happens when you have a super profits tax. If the super profits are not there then they do not pay the tax.                 Those over there do not want any money from the MRRT because they are in the pockets of some very big mining companies. But the truth is that $5.5 billion is not to be sneezed at at all and the claim the member made about a proportion of the surplus in 2016-17 is just plain wrong.

  I thank the member for Kennedy -                      I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I have a sense of what he was asking because he is interested in what happens to Australian workers. That makes him pretty lonely on that side of the House. I know that he makes the opposition uncomfortable, but he does at least -                      The member for Kennedy has raised issues to do with workplace relations. That would make him the Lone Ranger on that side of the House when it comes to talking about the conditions of workers, so thank you. He was asking me about 457 visas, and there are three points I would like to make.                 First of all, this government believes that where there are jobs in Australia that can be filled by Australians, we should do that. We also believe in providing the best training opportunities for Australians. That is why we have spent a record amount on training Australians to take advantage of the jobs in Australia. He specifically asked about Australia Post, and I can reassure any anxiety he may be feeling. I understand that in the mail delivery area of Australia Post there are no 457 visas. I understand that when it comes to administrative functions there is a total of three 457 visas. I understand that in their business called Star Trek - StarTrack -                      No, Star Trek is what you guys have for industrial relations! - Australia Post employs a total of one person on a 457 visa. So the answer to the member for Kennedy's question is: there are none in mail delivery and I understand there are three in administration and one in StarTrack.                 What I can also tell him is that the Migration Council has said that seven per cent of 457 workers have reported that they are being ripped off compared to their Australian counterparts. This is a shonk and should be tackled, and we are tackling it. I can also conclude and tell the member for Kennedy who is expressing his views about the 457 visas that we are clear where we stand, just as we are in terms of workplace relations generally. What I can report to him, though, is what the Leader of the Opposition said on 27 April 2012 in a speech to the IPA - Alex Hawke's favourite book of reference - about 457s. He said that 'under a coalition government, 457s won't just be a component, they'll be the mainstay of our immigration policy'.                   The member for Kennedy then left the chamber                    -

  I thank the member for Bass for his question. The budget handed down by the Treasurer last night set out a responsible plan to deliver a stronger economy by supporting jobs and supporting growth. But like all budgets, this budget involved a series of choices and since 2009 we have been making the choices to ensure that all of our new spending has been fully offset and in this budget we have set out $43 billion worth of savings measures. This budget outlines a 10-year plan to fund important investments to make our country a smarter and a fairer place, with investments in DisabilityCare Australia and investments in our plan for school improvement.                 But another important choice that we have taken has been to ensure that everybody pays their fair share, and central to that is our package of corporate tax integrity measures, cracking down on loopholes where multinationals are able to shift their profits offshore and to avoid paying their fair share of tax here in Australia. We have done that because we do not think it is fair that those companies be able to avoid paying their fair share and shift the burden onto other businesses that are doing the right thing and shift the burden onto mums and dads and families and small businesses across this country. But shortly we will be able to hear from the opposition about what choices they are prepared to take and whether or not they are prepared to stand up and crack down on these loopholes. Every time we have brought forward integrity measures to close loopholes in the tax base, they have come into this place and they have opposed them, so if you do not crack down on the loopholes you have to jack up taxes on those that are already paying their fair share or you have got to start to cut to the bone. When it comes to cutting to the bone I think we know what we are in for. At this stage of the cycle it might well be Downton Abbey Tony that we all see; that is what we will see.                     If they ever get the chance to get into government, we know exactly what we will see: what we have seen from Campbell Newman in Queensland. They will cut to the bone. They will cut pensions. They have already announced that. They will cut family payments. They will rip away the tax cuts that we have already delivered and that are in people's pockets and they will cut the Schoolkids Bonus. We believe in a fair system of taxation. We do not believe in allowing those that are ripping off the system to get away with it. We will take action and the Australian people will have a choice and that will be a choice between a government that has made responsible savings in order to invest in our nation and make it smarter and fairer, or going with an opposition that has no vision but a plan to cut to the bone.

  This is part of a continuing campaign by those opposite to cast slurs on the Treasury, particularly to cast slurs on the Treasury because they have believed in a market price for carbon. The member knows only too well that the European carbon price has hit historic lows, and that is a fact and it has happened for a variety of reasons in Europe. Of course, that is now reflected in the floating price that has been projected by us when we come out of the fixed price period. But for him to somehow suggest that this is a slur on the forecasters, when in fact a market is operating like a market, just says so much about the modern Liberal Party. They do not understand markets either and it is no wonder they have got some form of direct action policy so that they are going to charge every Australian family $1,200, a new form of central planning and central intervention masquerading as policy from those opposite. So we do not apologise for a second for having a market based price and reducing carbon pollution in our society - and I said so in my speech last night. We will continue and proceed with our carbon-pricing regime because it is driving investment in alternative energy, particularly renewable energy, and it is giving us a clean energy future - and the contrast here with those opposite is quite stark.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. Last night's budget was about jobs. It was brought to you by a government that is committed to jobs, led by the Labor Party, who believe in creating and maintaining good jobs for people. There are a lot of positive choices which have been reflected in last night's budget. There is job-creating, productivity-building infrastructure, there is a hand-up for the unemployed, we make sure that there is a better education system to prepare our workforce of the future, we make sure that people with disability and carers finally get brought in from the cold and we are determined in this budget to help eradicate the scourge of asbestos and eradicate workplace bullying. That is the Labor way. That is the government way.                 We choose smarter, stronger, fairer workplaces. But there is an obstacle to smarter, fairer workplaces and we all know what that one is: it is the Liberal plan to reintroduce unfair individual contracts. Last Thursday they let the cat out of the bag. They hoped to sneak it in just before the budget so no-one would notice it. At the centre of Liberal workplace relations nostalgia are unfair individual contracts. For instance, last Thursday they said, 'We are going to allow employees to trade off monetary conditions for non-money remuneration' - just like Work Choices. Yesterday the retailers were gleefully celebrating that they can knock off penalty rates - just like Work Choices. Today is another day and another employer group is breaking the discipline which the Liberals are desperate to keep on the employers not to let the cat out of the bag.                  The Australian newspaper - and no doubt you will call them propagandists soon - reports an 'enthusiastic embrace' of Tony Abbott's proposed changes to extend hours and cut conditions. There you have it: the retailers, the hoteliers; you have got it in your own policy. It is just like the budget really - you get a choice to have a fair go all round at work or you can have a choice to cut people's working conditions to the bone.                 We understand, and Australia understands, much as those opposite wish it was not so, that you cannot trust Liberals on workplace relations. Just ask the retailers. They know. Just ask the hoteliers. They know what you are on about. Just ask everyone who ever lost their job under Work Choices. In fact, you only have to read Battlelines to see that Tony Abbott says it might have been bad politics but it was very good economics. We did not trust you then and we do not trust you now.

  Another question, another fiddle with the figures. There is $9.8 billion in this budget to implement the school improvement program, something that everyone on this side of the House is absolutely proud of. Of course, we know what is going to happen if we do not get this program implemented. What it is actually going to mean if the existing model that those opposite support stays in place and we do not get Gonski, the school improvement model -                      Madam Speaker, there is no cut. But I can tell you where the cut will be. In my home state of Queensland, if Gonski is not implemented, there will be a cut all right - about $2 billion to schools in Queensland under the Liberal Party policy, thereby proving the point that I made earlier. What the Liberals in this House are really on about is taking an axe to the social safety net and in particular to health and education because it is in their DNA. That is what they do. That is why we have had all this fiscal fearmongering today from them.                 Today we have a statement from former Prime Minister Howard who says that our debt levels are low. Former Prime Minister Howard can acknowledge the fundamental economic fact in this country but not those Neanderthals on the other side who want to implement a form of austerity in this country which will take the axe to health and education and jobs.

  I thank the member for Robertson for that question. There is really not an Australian who has not been touched by cancer, who has not suffered it themselves, who has not seen a friend or a family member lost or undergo treatment that may be successful but is so harsh.                 Budgets are about choices. They are about alternative visions for the future. So while we have made responsible savings in this budget, we have also made a choice to invest in world-class cancer care. Australia's cancer patients now have the best overall survival rate in the world and we have a plan to build on that success with better research, better prevention, better treatment, more cures and better support for patients and their families. World-leading cancer care will make investments in cancers including breast, cervical, prostate, lung and bowel cancers to ensure that we continue to set the international benchmark. I am not sure why someone finds this funny.                     This new investment is on top of an unprecedented $3½ billion to combat cancer since 2007, like the brand new $39 million cancer centre at the Gosford Hospital which means that patients no longer have to drive to Sydney or Newcastle to get radiotherapy treatments for free. Women aged 69 to 74 will be invited to be part of our breast screening program. We estimate this will pick up an extra 600 cancers a year, and expanded investment in the McGrath Foundation Breast Care Nurses will support around 15,000 women and their families over the next four years.                 Improved bowel cancer screening over the next four years will see 5.4 million invitations to attend bowel cancer screening and around 1,370 critically ill patients will find it easier to get bone marrow transplants. Patients will have better access to more affordable chemotherapy drugs, helping 50,000 patients over just the next six months, noting that we have added 32 new cancer drugs to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme since 2007. There is new funding for CanTeen, the Australian organisation for young people living with cancer. There is four years more funding for the excellent prostate cancer research centres at Epworth in Melbourne and Princess Alexandra in Brisbane and new funding for the Kinghorn Cancer Centre in Sydney, because prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men in Australia and the second most common cause of cancer deaths. Lung cancer - the most common form of cancer death - receives $6 million, and there is $36.6 million for cervical cancer. Australians have the best overall cancer survival rates in the world. We want to keep it that way. We have chosen to invest. We have a plan for the future.

  I thank the member for that question, because we have fully accounted in the budget for all of the actual arrivals up to budget. We have also, in the budget, published the methodology for calculating the forecasts in the budget. We do these forecasts by taking advice from security agencies, impacts of future policies and the history of the issue. In the shorter term we take advice on intelligence and expected outcomes of government policy interventions and, of course, in the longer term we move to longer term averages.                 I want to make this point: the government have been blocked every step of the way by those opposite when we have sought to put in place the full suite of policies that is required to stop the people smugglers. Those over there are the best friends people smugglers ever had because they have actively blocked the attempts that we have put in place!                     Our policies are designed to stop -                      I withdraw.                     Our policies are designed to stop this evil trade and to stop the deaths at sea, but we need a full suite of policies such as the full suite that was recommended to us by the Houston inquiry. Part and parcel of that was the arrangement we came to with Malaysia, and they would not come to the party in this parliament. That has been a very substantial problem. So I made that statement before because they are culpable - very culpable - in terms of the current arrival rate.                 The government will do everything within its power to stem the boats - everything we can possibly do - but the one thing it will not do is tell lies to the Australian people, like the Leader of the Opposition about somehow turning boats back to Indonesia. He cannot do that, and he knows it.                     I withdraw. The policy that the Leader of the Opposition says he has is not one that is capable of being implemented, and he knows it. So it is a fiction that he puts before the Australian people. This government will do everything in our power to stem the flow of people coming through the people smugglers, including a suite of new policies that we are putting in place to do precisely that, and, when we bring them forward, we would like to have some support from the opposition.

  I thank the member for McEwen for his question, because this Labor government is about building a stronger and fairer society and one that has a sustainable family payment system - something that this side of the parliament is absolutely committed to. It was this government that delivered Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme. It is this government that has, of course, introduced the Schoolkids Bonus to make sure that when children are going back to school each year they get that extra support, and they get it from this government. We know that those opposite are intent on cutting the Schoolkids Bonus - clawing it back and taking it out of the pockets of every single family that depends on it.                 We will continue to make sure that families get the support that they need, and that is why we have made some difficult decisions - some tough choices - in this budget. We have decided that we need to make some changes to the family payments system, end the baby bonus and make sure that we better target support for newborns. So what we have done in this year's budget is make these changes that will still see the vast majority of families get an increased payment when they have a newborn as part of their family tax benefit part A payment. This new payment better reflects the essential costs of having a newborn baby. Many of the other families who will be no longer eligible for the baby bonus will be eligible for our paid parental leave scheme.                 We have made these changes because we know how important it is to fund the very significant investments that we intend to make in schooling for our children to make sure that right out into the future there will be the funding available so that every child in this country gets a great education. These are tough choices, but choices that this government has been prepared to make.                 The member for North Sydney talks about responsibility, talks about the need to make these sorts of tough choices in the family payments system, but when we put these to the parliament he takes them to his party room and gets rolled - not able to maintain any position. We know the latest debate that is going on inside the party room of those opposite is to do with the -                      This government will make sure that families are looked after. We will make sure that we deliver the funding that all of the children in this country need to get a great education.

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question and know that on behalf of his constituents he is very focused on jobs and opportunity and on making sure that every child gets a great education. I know that he personally has been a very big advocate for disability care.                  On Tuesday night in the government's budget we laid out our choice for Australia's future. We laid out clearly before the Australian people the future that we want to build for them. It is a future that would be fairer because it is a future that would include disability care. It is our way of supporting Australians with disability, their carers and families and of giving peace of mind to every Australian that, should the worst happen to either them or a member of their family, disability care would be there. We laid out before the Australian people very clearly the decisions we had made to fully fund disability care over a decade. Those were not easy decisions but the right decisions for the nation's future.                 On Tuesday we deliberately chose a smarter future for our nation, investing $14.5 billion extra into school education, seeking to work with states and territories around the country on a two for one funding deal to make sure that every Australian school - all 9,500 of them - has the resources that they need in that school to get those children a great education tied with a plan for school improvement that we know will work because we have seen it work in Australian schools. We outlined our choice for a stronger economy in the future, an economy in which we support jobs and growth - decent jobs, jobs with good working conditions, jobs that Australians will want to do and be able to build their lives around, jobs of the future during this century of change in our region. These are jobs that will require us to have the best of infrastructure, the National Broadband Network and a clean energy future.                 In laying out your choices, you show the nation what you believe the nation should become in the future. Tonight is the turn of the Leader of the Opposition to do the same - to lay out his choices for the nation's future and particularly to be transparent with the Australian people about his plans.                     Thank you very much, Speaker. I was making the very simple point that the opportunity the Leader of the Opposition has tonight is to lay out his alternate choice for the nation, a choice to cut to the bone, a choice that Australians should have the full information on so they can see the differences very clearly between the government's plan and what the Leader of the Opposition has in store for the Australian people if he has a chance.

  I can well understand his embarrassment. He is embarrassed because their policy that they want to take forward is going to result in very significant cuts to schools right across the country because we have increased school funding substantially. Real education funding has increased by 35 per cent.                     Real funding for education has increased by 35 per cent since 2007-08, and what we have put at the heart of this budget - which everyone on this side of the House is proud of - is a very substantial increase in funding for the school improvement program. Over six years, $9.8 billion will go to improve schools right around our nation if we can get the state premiers to sign up. Barry O'Farrell has had the guts to do so. Other state premiers have not been so forthcoming, because the Leader of the Opposition has been out there trying to bully them into not signing up to a financial agreement which will mean better schools right across our whole nation. At least Barry O'Farrell in New South Wales has had the decency to recognise how important this future funding is for schools right around our country.                 The spokesman opposite knows that the national partnership money has been rolled into this increased funding, and, as is usual, he comes in here fiddling the figures - distorting them - trying to conduct a fear campaign when we have got in place a program which is acceptable to the Liberal Premier of New South Wales for all of the schools in that state. But those opposite want to play politics with this issue. They are acutely embarrassed by the fact that they want to stop an existing funding model which in my state of Queensland, if they were in power, would mean $2 billion less for Queensland schools. I can tell you this: this is going to be an acute embarrassment for the Liberals in Queensland and those other states that have not signed up, because this goes to the core of what sort of Australia we want and whether there is a government prepared to make the investments for the future. We on this side of the House are prepared to make those investments; those on that side of the House have a plan for cuts to the bone, particularly in health and education.                 Leave not granted.

  I thank the member for Bass for that question. We do have a detailed plan to create prosperity in our nation and to spread opportunity to every postcode of our nation. What we are doing in this budget is building on our underlying economic streets. We have an economy which is 13 per cent bigger than it was before the global financial crisis, and it will be 22 per cent bigger by mid-2015. Something like 960,000 jobs have been created in Australia since we came to office, and we have got a AAA credit rating from the three major global rating agencies. What all this says is that we got the big economic calls right in this country when they were needed, and, in particular, we got them right during the global financial crisis.                 Overnight we have seen some more disturbing data which has come from Europe. We have now seen that there have been six consecutive quarters of negative growth in Europe, and what is being done in Europe is they are following a policy of austerity - austerity for austerity's sake. What that is leading to is contractions in those economies and higher unemployment. We on this side of the House have taken a choice. We have taken the choice to support jobs and growth and to do that for the long-term benefit of our economy. The budget makes our economy stronger through critical investments in infrastructure but also makes our nation smarter because we have put in place additional investment for the school improvement program. Most importantly, it makes our nation fairer, because we are fully funding DisabilityCare Australia.                  I guess that is why it was so disappointing to see in the Telegraph today that a source very close to the Liberals said that they would not be providing the same amount of money as the government would provide for DisabilityCare. They were telegraphing, if you like, in the Leader of the Opposition's favourite newsletter that they were going to cut funding for DisabilityCare Australia. On this side of the House there is a vision for the future, there are detailed plans and there is funding for a decade. What we know is on that side of the House is a plan for vicious cuts, a plan for cuts to disability and a plan for cuts to schooling, because what they are doing is following the approach of Campbell Newman. Campbell Newman took to the people of Queensland a whole set of proposals, none of which he did after the election. He had a commission of audit and he cut to the bone in the state of Queensland. He slashed health and slashed education. The Leader of the Opposition is going to try to skate through tonight not providing any great detail, and he is going to do that because he knows that, if he told the Australian people about his plans, they would never accept those sorts of vicious cuts to the bone.

  I thank the member for his question. I was asked about our forecast yesterday and provided a detailed answer. I said yesterday that our medium-term forecasts are based on actual arrivals. We take advice from security agencies, we look at the history of the issue and, as we go out further, we look at historical averages. I made the point very clearly yesterday that the government will do everything within its power to stop the people smugglers. But of course there is one roadblock in the way of that: those opposite, and particularly the Leader of the Opposition, have opposed key recommendations, that came to us through the Houston inquiry, to do more offshore processing - in particular in Malaysia. That is why I very clearly said yesterday that he is the best friend that people smugglers have ever had, because the opposition of those opposite sent a message to the region, and it was not a very good message at all.

  To the member for Denison's question, I think all members of this House and members of the Australian community in general are appalled by animal cruelty. We all share those sentiments. To the extent that we ever see images of animal cruelty, we are all revulsed by those images. I understand that, and the live animal export industry understand that as well.                 We have worked with industry, once animal cruelty came to light - most particularly on a Four Corners program. It became clear to me at that point that this industry, which is important for jobs, particularly in the north of Australia, was one where self-regulation was not working. I formed the view that if we did nothing it would become inevitable that Australian people would withdraw the social licence to this industry, and the industry would be no more.                 We have worked with industry to put it on a sustainable footing and also to ensure that there are tracking and tracing systems for where animals from Australia are exported to, and the circumstances in which they are then dealt with in countries to which they are exported. We did that following a review led by Bill Farmer, and we have implemented the measures.                 To the member for Denison's question and his request for a personal guarantee from me, I think the member for Denison, like other members, would understand that as a matter of common sense we regulate many aspects of life in many aspects of business. We have road rules to regulate conduct on the road; we have our taxation system and the rules associated with it to regulate tax. Overwhelmingly, people do the right thing. There are times when people do not do the right thing and the purpose of having regulation and then having tracking and tracing is so that you can find instances where people have done the wrong thing and you can act on those instances. That is the approach we are taking to the live animal export industry, and the approach that we will continue to take.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question and for the very hard work that she does for families in her electorate. In this budget this government has had to make some difficult, but responsible, decisions to continue to make our family payments system both fairer and sustainable over the long term.                 We know that it is important for families that we deliver to those who need it most, and we deliver it when families need it most. That is, of course, why this government delivered Australia's first national Paid Parental Leave scheme so that working parents could have some extra financial support to have time off from work when their newborn baby came along. Of course, our Paid Parental Leave scheme is fair to working women, unlike that proposed by those opposite, that would see ordinary working women and men paying subsidies of up to $75,000 to wealthy bank executives, or lawyers, to have a baby.                 That is what those opposite want to do. We have seen the true colours of those opposite today, the true colours of those opposite. The member for Leichhardt, so out of touch with the needs of working women. The member for Leichhardt should be sacked: he is so out of touch with the needs of a working mother here in this parliament who needed time off to be with her baby.                 This government has also done the right thing by parents by introducing the Schoolkids Bonus. We know how important the Schoolkids Bonus is for parents. It really makes a difference when parents have those extra costs at the start and in the middle of the school year. We know once again that this is what the Leader of the Opposition wants to slash. He wants to get in there and get rid of the Schoolkids Bonus, which would see parents lose hundreds of dollars every single year. We know that the Schoolkids Bonus is helping parents; in contrast, this Leader of the Opposition just wants to get out there and cut it to the bone.                 This government is all about making what are sometimes very difficult choices, and this is a choice that is made in this year's budget so that we can fund the additional money that is needed for children's education. The Leader of the Opposition needs to come clean and make plain to parents: is he going to support the decisions, the difficult decisions, that this government has made in its budget, or does he have other secret plans that he is not going to reveal to Australian families?

  Well you should have spent a bit more time actually reading the budget papers -                      and in particular that table, because what I was referring to was the percentage of GDP at 20.2.                     That is what I was referring to.                     This is simply part of the fiscal fearmongering by those opposite. The whole country knows that net debt here is low, it is small compared to net debt across other developed economies, at 11.4 per cent.                 And it is not just the government that is saying these things. We have had the rating agencies commenting on the budget, which completely repudiates the line of attack that is coming from those opposite. This is what S&amp;P had to say:                 [The] government continues to demonstrate a commitment to prudent fiscal policy over the medium term. Given the low level of public debt _                     Yes, at 20.2 per cent. And that is what the tables actually show.                 What we have here is the fiscal fearmongering of those opposite. What I was reading from, before I was interrupted, was the judgement of the rating agencies. Here we go again; this is Moody's after the budget, 'Australia's relatively low level of government debt has been one of the factors supporting the AAA rating'. So this government has, for the first time in the history of the country, a AAA credit rating, a stable outlook, from the three major global rating agencies - not something ever achieved by the previous coalition government. That is because of the stewardship of this government, the way in which we have managed the economy in recent times. But they want to go around and exaggerate the levels of debt, and the purpose of exaggerating it in the way that they are is so that, if they get to power, they can go out and slash and burn when it comes to health and education. They want to pretend that our debt levels are not low; they want the excuse to rip out the social safety net and they want to follow a policy of austerity for austerity's sake.                 But we have also had some commentary from another person over the last week or so. Even former Prime Minister Howard said our debt levels were low. Former Prime Minister Howard said that in the last couple of weeks. So stop the fiscal fearmongering. Give us some detail tonight, and when we do not see it we will know that you intend to hide your real plans from the Australian people.

  I thank the member for Page for her question. Indeed this is a federal Labor government that has been making investments to make the economy stronger to ensure that we are a smarter and fairer society. We make substantial investments in our regions and in our cities and we invest in rail as well as our roads. Investment in rail, of course, takes cars and trucks off our roads and makes our roads safer as well as more productive, and this year's budget continues that commitment. If you look at the big projects, at the big roads, at the Hume Highway, the duplication fully from Sydney to Melbourne will be finished in the next two months. If you look at the Bruce Highway, $5.7 billion committed compared with $1.3 billion over a similar period of time by those opposite. If you look at the Pacific Highway, $7.9 billion committed compared with $1.3 billion from those opposite. If you look at the Pacific Highway, which is of particular interest to the member for Page and the member for Richmond, and you look at the work, work will be completed in the next financial year just north of Grafton at the Devils Pulpit section. Work will continue to the north of that on the Tintenbar to Ewingsdale section, where we have over half a billion dollars of federal funds committed, completing the preconstruction activities between Tyndale and Maclean and Harwood on Chatsworth Island south of Woodburn and north of Broadwater - all of that work funded.                 In the next year work will start on duplication - in the next couple of months, indeed - on the long overdue Frederickton to Eungai section and on the sections between Oxley Highway and Kundabung, Kundabung and Kempsey, Warrell Creek and Nambucca Heads, Nambucca Heads and Urunga - all of which has received the support of members on this side of this House, as well as the member for Lyne.                 I am asked how this report has been received. Well, last month I opened the Kempsey bypass, the longest bridge ever built in Australia. The member for Lyne was there. It was promised, funded, built and opened by this government; 100 per cent funds from the Australian government, zip from the New South Wales government. But I thought, well, what have they got against funding this section of road - not one cent. The local member, the member for Cowper, did not bother to show up. So they did not bother to participate in the community activity but there was some funding. There was funding of this full-page ad by Andrew Stoner from the National Party with the state infrastructure minister and leader of the New South Wales Nats claiming credit.                     The wouldn't put a cent into the roads . They saved it all for the ad.

  In fact that is not what I said yesterday. I said it was not necessary to lift the debt cap, we would review it in the usual way and we would amend it if it was required. That is what I said in the House yesterday. Now what we have here is a situation where the shadow Treasurer is running around quoting the market value of Commonwealth government securities when he knows that what counts for the debt cap is, of course, the face value.                     Absolutely; I am pleased that you have finally admitted to that. Now if he would like to go to the AOFM website he could have a look there and see what the face value of securities on issue is. Currently the face value on issue is $268 billion - but he wanted to come into this House and pretend it was a far higher figure. So that is all part of his strategy for fiscal fear mongering. Well, I can certainly say to the shadow Treasurer that it does not need to be lifted in this year or next year.

  I thank the member for Canberra for the question. I know how important it is to her that these students in her electorate are receiving the support from this government. Let me just look quickly at an 'us versus them' scenario to let people understand what we have done in the past and what we want to do in the future.                 In the member's electorate we have spent $131 million. Seventeen libraries have been improved, 23 multipurpose halls and 21 classrooms - incidentally, about 3,000 libraries have been supported nationwide. When they were in office there were around 3,000 flagpoles supplied. Then let us look at the national curriculum and the introduction of a national curriculum with world's best standard material to be taught to kids in schools. The only contribution that we have had from the opposition was to pull the Union Jack out of the bottom drawer and reheat the history wars.                 Then let us look at trades training centres - fantastic facilities. In the member's electorate she has two trades training centres. Eight schools benefit, and nationwide over 1,000 schools are benefiting from trades training centres. The coalition managed to knock up about a dozen Australian technical colleges and then wanted to cut this program in the last budget. That gives you an indication of both priorities and track record between this Labor government, which is committed to education, and those opposite, who are committed to cutting it.                 In the budget we laid out the plan for the future supported by $9.8 billion of investment. It is a future where Australian schools keep pace with schools in our region, a future where Australian students get to reach their full potential and a future where a student, no matter where they live and no matter how much money their parents earn, get the same high-quality education.                 I am asked by the member how it has been received. There are plenty of things that I could refer to, but I thought I would just take the Australian Primary Principals Association media release. Here it is, 'Federal budget school funding welcomed'. It is important to refer to it, because these are the school leaders and this is what they said:                 It is very pleasing to see the increased school funding in the Budget for the next six years, a system of properly indexed funding for schooling based on the appropriate school resource standard and loadings based on need. This will be the backbone of school improvement.                 We absolutely agree and that is what we are totally committed to, and that is what is provided for in the budget.                 The Leader of the Opposition does not want to support the National Plan for School Improvement, which will see increased investment going to schools around the country. That means they will get less money, not more. Yes, they want to sack one in seven teachers, but they are not willing to commit to a National Plan for School Improvement which means that we as a nation can be sure that our students are getting the very best education they deserve.

  It is appropriate to do it each year at budget time.                     Exactly, and I have just said to you that we will not need to lift our debt limit this financial year or next financial year. I have made that point and that should be sufficient. But if he is very interested in this, he can go to the AOFM website and go through the material. They are regularly briefing the market about issuance. They are doing all of those things and that is where this is appropriately done.                 But what is this all really about? What this is about is that they are just acutely embarrassed about the fact that this Labor government had the guts to come out and say that we would have to have a deficit this year to support jobs and growth. We have had the guts to say that because that is the responsible thing to do in our economy.                     Thank you, Speaker. I was just pointing out that in the Liberal Party's world there is no level of responsible debt. Their approach to our current situation is that they would take an axe to health and education and an axe to jobs in our economy. Just because the global economy has taken an axe to our budget, that does not mean to say that we should take an axe to jobs and health and education in this economy. That is clearly what they would do, and that is the approach that they advocated during the global financial crisis. They said that we should not have a responsible level of debt to support jobs and growth in our economy and they would have seen this economy go into recession. They would not have had the guts to do what we did when we were faced with that set of circumstances.                 We have been faced with a new set of circumstances and we have responded in a responsible way. We responded in this way because we on this side of the House understand how important employment and job security is to all Australians wherever they live. Those on that side of the House are just playing from the playbook of the Tea Party in the United States. There is no level of responsible debt in the views of those people. In the views of those extremists and some people over there, there is no level of responsible debt and therefore when you hit a bump in the economy, when something happens globally, you do not do anything to support your economy. You take an axe to it.                 That is something this government will never do. Everyone over here is really proud of what we are doing to support jobs and growth. Those opposite would do directly the opposite. They would slash and cut and burn and follow the Campbell Newman approach and cut jobs right across our economy. That is not the Australian way.

  I thank the member for Makin for his question. The government has a responsible plan to build a stronger economy and to support jobs and growth. A responsible plan means that your plan must be fully funded and fully costed. That is why the budget that the Treasurer handed down earlier in the week sets out and locks in a fully funded 10-year plan to deliver on big initiatives, big nation-building initiatives, that will make our economy stronger and our society smarter and fairer - initiatives like DisabilityCare and our Plan for School Improvement.                 To fund these initiatives we have had to make some choices and we have had to deliver $43 billion worth of responsible savings measures. Tonight the Leader of the Opposition will have his opportunity to show us the sorts of choices that he is prepared to make, to lay his plans out on the table so the Australian people can see what it is he would do if he were the Prime Minister. When he does that, to make sure that they are responsible plans they should be fully funded and they should be fully costed. Fully costed does not mean going off and getting some dodgy costings from an accounting firm of the sort that we saw them use at the last election. We have set up the Parliamentary Budget Office. They should be properly costed in a proper way.                 We saw today, however, a bit of a sneak preview of the approach that the opposition will take, when they came into this place and voted against a bill to crack down on tax avoidance - new measures to crack down on profit shifting and tax avoidance. If there is a rort, a loophole or a rip-off, they are in there to protect it. That is what they did today: they came in to protect it.                 When it comes to the challenge of trying to put in place a responsible budget, we know that they will not crack down on the tax avoiders. So how will they fill the big black hole that has been generated by all of the unfunded commitments they have been making? The shadow Assistant Treasurer gave us a clue today when he was asked. He said, 'Cuts will have to be made.' That comes on the back of what the Leader of the Opposition had to say just a month ago, when he said, 'Some of the things we do will hurt.' The question is: who will they hurt? They will hurt families. They will hurt pensioners. We will see cuts to payments, cuts to pensions - cuts to the bone. That is what we will see from the opposition.                   The Leader of the Opposition needs to make sure that he takes the opportunity tonight to put his plans on the table, to show people what it is he intends to do, so that they have the choice between a government that has fully funded commitments and will deliver big reforms like DisabilityCare and a Plan for School Improvement or an opposition whose only plan is to make savage cuts, cuts to the bone.

  I really do thank him for this question - I really do. The fact that he could somehow say that the performance of the New Zealand economy is a better performance than the performance of the Australian economy leaves me completely dumbfounded. The fact is our economy is 13 per cent larger than it was prior to the global financial crisis.                     Thank you, Speaker. Unlike the shadow Treasurer I am proud of what our country has achieved over the past 5½ years: 960,000 jobs. How have we done that? Because we have a responsible level of debt, we have a good fiscal policy which has been given the tick by the major ratings agencies and we are making major investments in our future - major investments in economic infrastructure, major investments in schooling - and, of course, making our country fairer. We can do all of these things if we have a detailed plan.                 In our budget we have put out a detailed plan about how we are going to grow our economy, how we are going to be a smarter economy to take advantage of the Asian century and how we can make our society fairer. We have done that within a responsible fiscal policy. Our performance across any range of indicators is far better than New Zealand's. So I feel very sorry for the shadow Treasurer, who wants to keep running our country down. He does not get the basis of our economic strength. He does not understand what we need to do to keep our economy strong. Of course, they will invent any reason to avoid laying out a detailed plan for the future.                     Well, they will invent any reason, Speaker, for refusing to put out a detailed plan. That is why we have had the fiscal fearmongering in here today. They want to use the excuse of debt - which is low by any standard and far lower than New Zealand's - so they are not going to tell the Australian people what they would do if they were elected after September. We know they have a secret plan for savage cuts. We know that, and all of their economic questions asked in this House go to the very core proposition I have just put. When they come in here and say it is a big-spending government - which it is not - that is just code for saying that if they were in power they would slash and burn when it comes to health, education and jobs. That is why you will not see a detailed plan from the Leader of the Opposition tonight.

  I thank the member for Reid for his question; I know his interest in fair workplaces.                 The budget we heard on Tuesday night outlined our plans for fairer workplaces. We are investing in job-creating, productivity-building workplaces. We are making sure that we train our workforce of the future. We are making sure that we give a hand up for unemployed people to help them back into work. We are making sure that disabled people get a fair go all-round. We are tackling the scourge of asbestos and the scourge of workplace bullying.                 Labor has plans - fair plans - for workplaces in Australia. We have a smarter, stronger, fairer approach to Australian workplaces, but there is a clear choice as the member for Reid alluded to in his question, because there is an alternative plan for Australia's workplaces. We saw the cat out of the bag last Thursday when the opposition proposed the sly, sneaky and stealthy reintroduction of unfair individual contracts. And on Monday we heard the retailers rub their hands in glee: if the Liberals get in, the good times roll on for Work Choices. Then, on Tuesday the hoteliers had a crack. They said they would pop their champagne corks; they said, 'Fantastic, we can tackle penalty rates'.                   The member for Sturt                    then left the chamber.                     As I said: on Monday, the retailers were rubbing their hands; on Tuesday, the hoteliers were saying to pop the champagne corks - 'Work Choices, we can get the individual contract in the back way' - but today the Liberal party must have said, 'Oh my goodness,' when they read the Australian,because who is out there belling the wish list for the Liberal industrial relations? You got it, the Reithmeister is back! What he says is, 'Tony Abbott, if you want to be a long-term leader of the Liberal Party,' Peter Reith gave an ultimatum to the Liberal Party of today, he said, 'You'd better go hard on the workers, you'd better go hard on the employees'. He said, 'Unfair individual contracts: let's bring them back'. He said, 'Let's go after parental leave'. The Chief Opposition Whip must have been channelling his inner Reith today! But he goes further: he says, 'Let's have crack at unfair dismissal protection'. They must love Peter Reith on the opposition side. They must say, 'Thank you for Peter Reith'.                     The member for Mackellar got the political airbrush and there goes Peter Reith. The problem is, I borrowed a copy of Battlelines - did not buy it. Tony Abbott would like you to buy his book and the opposition leader says, 'Reith, in fact, acted as a political elder brother to many of his colleagues'. He was a big loss! He is now threatening the opposition leader. 'Do as I say, do what the extreme Right of the Liberal Party wants: bring back Work Choices or else. We can't have this choice in Australia'.                 We do not trust the Liberals on workplace relations. The Australian people have a memory longer than the member for Mackellar has.

  Absolutely dead wrong! The rating agencies, all three of them, that have given us a AAA-rating with a stable outlook all disagree with them. So the views of the ratings agencies apparently do not matter to the shadow Treasurer. That is pretty frightening, if he does not understand that - very frightening. He can go and find a report from a firm here or a firm there. But if you go through all of the judgements of the market economists that have been published in recent times, they give the budget a tick because it is good economics and it is good for the country.                 Now, of course, we had the shadow Treasurer before, talking about the example of New Zealand. Well, there are just a couple of small differences between Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand went into recession! New Zealand boosted the GST at the end of 2010. That is their dream! Jack up the GST!                     Unemployment in New Zealand has doubled since the global financial crisis. New Zealand is only four per cent bigger since before the global financial crisis. Australia is 13 per cent!                 We have a plan. They have a plan for savage cuts to our economy -                      They want to make it smaller. They want to make us more like New Zealand.

  I thank the member for Shortland for her timely question, because this morning the House resumed debate on five bills that implement the government's Living Longer Living Better package of aged-care reforms. This legislation has been subject to a very detailed work with the aged-care sector and follows the delivery already of a number of different elements of the package -                    The member for Cowan then left the chamber.                     elements like the design and the release of new home care packages, all consumer directed, that will begin operation this year; determinations by the new aged-care financing authority about how aged-care providers will access the increased accommodation payments from the government, as well as a fairer and more transparent system of accommodation charging for consumers; new programs that kick in this year for better dementia supports and better linkages between aged care, palliative care and other aspects of the health care system; and arrangements that start to lift the wages of literally tens of thousands of hardworking nurses, carers and other staff in the aged-care sector, improving recruitment and retention in this critical part of the workforce.                 In a typically Pavlovian response, the merest mention of improved wages and conditions set out in collective agreements rather than individual contracts or at the whim or their employer caused those opposite to be sent into a frenzy about leftist conspiracies, of course, but those who followed this debate will know that the announcements I made some weeks ago reflect entirely and exactly the advice that we received from the aged care sector through the National Aged Care Alliance - advice contained in the blueprint for aged-care reform, which I table again for the purposes of this debate and which includes the endorsement of every single significant aged-care provider in the country.                 It is time now to deal with this legislation. The legislation has broad support from very diverse groups in the sector and support from the biggest debt and equity providers of finance to this sector: the ANZ Bank, and AMP Capital, respectively. Big providers like Catholic Health Care and Anglicare are urging the parliament to deal with these bills. Perhaps most importantly of all, consumer groups like the Council on the Ageing and Alzheimer's Australia have expressed their support for this legislation.                 The government is, of course, aware that the Senate has conducted an inquiry into these bills and will report very soon. We are looking forward to that report and we are looking forward to the debate that we assume will follow in that chamber. I urge the opposition to dispense with the delaying tactics in this place. Let's finish the debate when the House resumes the week after next and let's all get on with the job of providing better aged-care services to older Australians.

  We have prepared a budget based on the forecasts of the Treasury. Our budget and its forecasts have been prepared by the same officials that prepared budgets for the previous government -                      They are not? I can tell you that they are.                     By and large they are, yes, it is true that there has been a change in terms of the permanent head, but the group that is doing the budgets for us is substantially the group that was doing them for those opposite. We have accepted in full the forecast of the Treasury in our budget over our forward estimates. We have done that because they are realistic, and as I said before to the shadow Treasurer, if you read basically the analysis of the market economists, it generally accepts the central proposition that has been put forward in the budget in terms of our growth forecasts. If he denies that, he can do that at the risk of simply getting people up there to go and read what all of the credible market economists have been saying. I ask people to do that because this attempt to discredit our forecasts is despicable, because what they are doing is reflecting on the professionalism of our public servants - despicable and disgraceful. This is a political agenda which is designed to get the Leader of the Opposition off the hook because he does not intend to provide detailed plans for the future in his budget reply tonight, because he knows that, if he supplied the detailed plans that they really have for the future, they would be unacceptable to the Australian people because those opposite have an economic approach which endorses the approach of austerity which is being used so unsuccessfully in Europe. They do not believe in supporting jobs and growth like this government. We are members of the Labor Party; it is in our DNA, and we always do everything that we can to support jobs and growth. Yes, we have had a challenge in our economy over the past 12 months caused principally by a higher Australian dollar and a lower terms of trade. The dollar has been higher for longer and had a dramatic impact on the profitability of our companies. All of the profit based taxes are down, and it is not principally the resource rent taxes, as he dishonestly said in his remarks before. It is company tax, it is superannuation tax, it is capital gains tax, it is resource rent taxes - all of them are down to the tune of $60 billion, and the logical proposition that he is putting to the house today is that if they were in government, faced with these revenue downgrades, they would cut over the forward estimates by $60 billion, and then you would see some real damage to jobs and growth in our economy and you would see some real damage to the quality of education and healthcare in our country.                    The member for                    Bass then left the chamber                   .

  I thank the member for Fowler for his question. I am asked about transparent and responsible fiscal policy. Of course, this is budget week and this is the week in which the government makes its choices for the Australian nation clear through our budget, and we have done that - our choices to make the nation stronger, smarter and fairer. People can look at the documents, people can assess our choices and they can agree with them or disagree with them, but they are transparent for all to see.                 Of course, budget week is not just about the government's budget and responsible and transparent fiscal policy is not just about the government's budget; it is also about the alternatives put forward in this parliament by the opposition, particularly by the Leader of the Opposition tonight. I would like to endorse words spoken in this parliament on 14 May 2003. These were words spoken about the then opposition leader's reply to the budget. The quote is as follows:                 When he gives his response to the budget tomorrow night, he needs to tell us exactly what he would do. If the tax cut was not enough, how much would he add to it? Once he has told us how much he would add to it, he then needs to tell us what he would cut to pay for it.                 _ he should tell us exactly where it is coming from and he should tell us exactly what will be cut to pay for any increase in spending that he proposes.                 Words spoken in this parliament in 2003, words I specifically endorse, words spoken by the Leader of the Opposition. That is his test tonight that was set by him. It is a test he should pass. It is not a test he can quibble with because he said it himself. What does his test for his reply mean -                      I see the protection racket has started. Here we go.                     This is a time for questions and it is a time for answers. The Leader of the Opposition, having set his own test for his budget reply tonight, must certainly do this. If he endorses DisabilityCare, does he endorse every saving to pay for it and, if not, what are the alternate saves? Does he endorse our plan for school improvement? If not, does he take the responsibility of cutting half a million dollars off every Australian school? What is he going to do? What is he going to cut to fill the $70 billion black hole the shadow Treasurer revealed on morning television? What will be used to fill that black hole? If he is not taking the money off the mining revenue, what will be cut to make up for that $5.5 billion? If he is not taking the revenue from the carbon tax, what will be cut to make up that loss of revenue? What is on the chopping block - health, education, pensions or family payments? The real answer is all of it, and the Leader of the Opposition should detail every cut tonight, every cut to the bone. With those words, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.

  From the Leader of the Opposition we continue to hear misrepresentation about the circumstances of the Australian economy. It is remarkable to me that he is audacious enough to come into this parliament and talk about the Olympic Dam when he was so exposed on national television as making false claims about the Olympic Dam and not even bothering to read a few pages put out by the company, which accurately went to the issues about the Olympic Dam investment - all of it emblematic of the Leader of the Opposition's approach, which is that you seek to whip up fear but you never bother to acquaint yourself with the facts.                 To the Leader of the Opposition: we in this nation have a resilient and strong economy. The government have worked hard to ensure it is resilient and strong and we have focused on jobs and growth. I would refer the Leader of the Opposition to reports in today's newspapers about how difficult it will be under his proposal for Australian businesses to increase company taxation and the way in which that will flow through to the things that ordinary Australians use, particularly the mortgages that they have on their homes.                 I am pleased that under this government we have seen falls in interest rates, which means that, for the average mortgage, Australians are $5,500 a year better off. Their mortgage repayments have been reduced. The Leader of the Opposition talks about business certainty. What he really means is that if he is ever Prime Minister it is certain that Australian businesses would be paying more tax and, in accordance with today's newspaper reports, that would mean interest rates for families and small businesses would go up. So to the Leader of the Opposition, who is keen to give economic lectures but never actually analyses his own policies, I would say: it is bad for the Australian economy for him to put up company tax and it is bad for the Australian economy for him to reduce the amount of money in superannuation funds.                     These are things that would hit working people and the resilience of our economy hard. In the meantime, the government will keep doing what we do, pointing out the risk that the Leader of the Opposition poses to jobs and growth, while we go on harnessing jobs and growth in the interests of working Australians.

  I thank the member for Corangamite for his question - and the circumstances of 1,200 Ford workers are no laughing matter. The workers involved are clearly still dealing with the stress and shock which comes with being told late last week that their jobs will not be continuing after October 2016. This is a very serious matter, and I can assure the House it is taken very seriously by the government.                 As a result of our view that working people in these circumstances must be treated with dignity and respect, the government has already announced that for the individual Ford workers involved - the nearly 1,200 workers who now know that their jobs will not be continuing - we will roll out the most intensive form of employment assistance, working with them to help them find another opportunity beyond their jobs at Ford.                 What I can certainly say about those working people is that they are highly skilled; they are proud of what they do because they are so highly skilled. You meet people who have got their skills in the automotive industry in so many other walks of life, and we will work with them to seize a new opportunity.                 Second, we understand that this announcement by Ford has implications up the supply chain for those who work making the components that Ford uses, which is why we have already announced that we will add to a current program - a $30 million program - an additional $10 million of investment from the federal government and $2 million of investment from the Victorian state government to work with those component companies in the supply chain to keep diversifying their opportunities to sell their products.                 We understand that this is a serious matter for the communities of Geelong and the greater region - and, of course, I am asked this question by the member for Corangamite and this is of very great significance to the area he represents in this parliament. It is also of very great significance to the area of Broadmeadows and associated areas in Melbourne's north and west where people who work at the Broadmeadows plant live. So we have allocated $30 million, joined by $9 million from the Victorian government, and we call on Ford to make a sizeable contribution in order to assist with getting new opportunities and new sources of growth into those regional economies.                 We will keep working with local communities, with Ford workers and with suppliers. I am very determined, despite the shock of this news for those people, that no-one is left behind and that the government works with them to seize a new opportunity for the future.

  Thank you very much. To the member's question: first, as she should know, that $34 million investment was to secure work on the models that are going to be produced by Ford up until October 2016, so we made that commitment to secure the jobs of working people not only at Ford but up the supply chain and it was the right thing to do. I understand that the member for Indi has a different approach: she wants to rip at least half a billion dollars out of industry support and up to $2 billion dollars out of industry support - that is, she is advocating a plan that would be crushing for the Australian automotive industry.                     I was asked about apologies. I think the member for Indi should apologise, along with the Leader of the Opposition, for their plan to cut assistance to the automotive sector by $500 million. They should apologise for standing for a plan that would cut in half assistance to 2015. They should apologise for standing for a plan that puts at risk the jobs of every auto worker in this country - that is, 50,000 direct jobs at Holden, Toyota and dozens of suppliers and a further 200,000 jobs in related industries. The member for Indi and the Leader of the Opposition should apologise for that.                 On this side of the parliament, unlike those opposite, we stand for jobs and growth. We stand for working with manufacturing to ensure that it is a source of strength for the Australian economy into the future and we will not endorse the opposition's plans to cut to the bone, including cutting industry assistance to the bone, and potentially seeing tens of thousands of Australians thrown out of work.

  I thank the member for Banks for his question, because our budget is all about putting jobs and growth first. Of course, the results are in. From day one we have always supported jobs and growth, and the consequence is an economy that is 13 per cent larger than it was at the end of 2007. There have been 950,000 jobs created during this government's period in office, but we face a transition in our economy and that transition brings with it challenges. There are the challenges of the higher dollar - and we have seen the consequence of that at Ford for the workers there and their families. But this government will do everything within its power to assist those affected with the consequences of that decision that has come from Ford.                 We on this side of the House do have a commitment to supporting the workforce in these areas. But the budget I brought down over a week ago gets the big economic decisions right and, in particular, the long-term sustainability of the budget so we can make the right investments for the future to secure prosperity.                 Of course one of the big decisions that this government has taken is paid parental leave, which is now rolling out to 280,000 Australian families. They are benefiting from paid parental leave because we have a responsible and affordable paid parental leave scheme which stands in very stark contrast to the scheme put forward by the Leader of the Opposition, who wants to pay $75,000 to the families of millionaires.                 We have seen some commentary about this in the papers today from the banking industry. They are saying that, because the Leader of the Opposition is going to jack up company tax, they are going to jack up interest rates; they are going to jack up their margins; they are going to put up mortgages for the average Australian family -                      This was a question about growth and jobs and the right choices the government must make to support growth and jobs. In jacking up the company tax rate, the Leader of the Opposition is going to slug Australian companies, and the banks have said very clearly they are going to jack up interest rates between 10 basis points and 25 basis points. This should not be news to the shadow Treasurer over there, because he had this to say: 'Any additional taxes you put on banks they just pass straight through to consumers.' Perhaps he should have told that to the Leader of the Opposition, because what we have here is a fair commitment to support families when they have children. In particular, we support them in the early stages when they have children with an additional $2,000. The Leader of the Opposition is going to rip that away. The Leader of the Opposition is going to rip away the schoolkids bonus and the Leader of the Opposition is going to jack up interest rates, slugging Australian families yet again.

   I thank the honourable member for his question; I have waited for three years to get one. When I finally get one it is one that seeks to take advantage of the loss of employment for working Australians in Geelong and Broadmeadows. If he had had a look at Ford's statement and what they actually had to say, he would see that what Ford was speaking about was the emissions targets internationally and the European system in terms of emissions standards that were there.                 What I have done as the minister, as I have done across the board, is consult with Ford, Holden and Toyota at face-to-face meetings and work through it with them in an entirely appropriate way. If you speak to Ford they will confirm that is the case. We have worked in a cooperative way, in a way which secured change in the industry - change that is needed in a carbon constrained world - but in a way that was consistent with maintaining jobs. That is what we have done for each of the three companies.                 Hence you have seen major support for the transition in terms of some export vehicles in Toyota, such as the changes that we have made with regard to, for example, the Ford Territory. If you actually had a discussion with Ford, which clearly the shadow minister has not, they would confirm that not only did we receive the appropriate advice from my department and appropriate advice from the bureau that looks at these things in terms of transport and regional economics, but we also sat down with the managers and operators at Ford, Holden and Toyota, and - something you would never do - we also sat down with the workers and their representatives. That is something you would never do because any job loss is just an opportunity for you. What we have done is engage in appropriate consultation. We have provided the appropriate support, unlike you and your policy -                      That would cut $500 million out of assistance and would lead to job losses not just directly but in all those component areas as well that create some 200,000 jobs throughout the country. That would be absolutely at risk -                     -                      The nong opposite says we did nothing. We consulted with industry; and Ford does not say, as you would suggest, that that is a reason for their closure.

  I thank the member for Dobell for his question. I did have the opportunity to be on the Central Coast talking about $600 million of infrastructure investment which will benefit people as they move along the Central Coast and do the drive into Sydney for work - getting rid of 22 sets of traffic lights. I think people understand what a difference it will make to a journey to not have to stop and start 22 times.                 But the member does raise with me a different issue, and that is the security and quality of water supplies. I do acknowledge that this is of concern to people on the Central Coast, and, more broadly, it has particularly been of concern as the coal seam gas industry has got going in Australia and spread. I believe it is important for us as a government - indeed, for us as a nation - to find the right way of balancing mining, and the economic investment and progress and jobs that mining brings, while ensuring that our natural environment is protected for the future.                 The approach that we are taking is different from the one that the member advocates in his private member's bill. So we are taking a different approach and not endorsing the member's approach in his private member's motion. The approach we are taking has been to ensure that, under federal environmental protection legislation, you can have water issues triggering federal laws and federal assessments. We have also made sure that the best of scientific evidence is available not only to us but also more broadly to the community, through having an expert scientific committee that will look at the assessments of the way in which underground water and mining coincide and the implications of one for the other.                 To the member for Dobell: I am not in a position to agree to the private member's bill that he is putting forward. We do not think that is the right course. But it is an important issue that he raises, and so we are legislating so that these water issues can be the subject of in-detail federal government environmental assessments.

  I thank the member for Greenway very much for her question and for the way in which she stands up for the interests of young families, especially young families in her electorate of Greenway.                 This government is all about building a fairer Australia and making sure that we provide support to families when they need it most. That is why this government delivered Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme, which has seen so many parents able to take time off work to spend that precious time with their newborn babies. And it is why this government has introduced the schoolkids bonus - making sure that parents get support when their kids go back to school and helping to pay for school books, uniforms and all the things that kids need at school.                 We have made the right choices to support families. By contrast, those opposite just want to claw back the schoolkids bonus. They would take $15,000 out of the pockets of an average family over the school lives of their children. That is what this Leader of the Opposition would do. At the same time that he wants to do that, this Leader of the Opposition wants to pay a wealthy mother $75,000 to have a baby - $75,000 to have a baby, while he rips away $15,000 out of the pockets of an average family. That is the sort of choice in front of Australian families today.                 The way that the Leader of the Opposition is going to pay for his rolled-gold paid parental leave scheme is by jacking up a new levy on business. The banks have been out there today telling everyone exactly what is going to happen if this Leader of the Opposition gets his way. The banks will be out there increasing the cost of mortgages and increasing credit-card costs. As the Treasurer has already indicated - and the member for North Sydney knows this is true - the member for North Sydney has been heard saying, 'If you put an extra tax on the banks they will just pass it through in increased costs to consumers.' The member for North Sydney knows that his Leader of the Opposition is going to put an extra tax on the banks, and up will go the cost of credit cards and up will go the cost of mortgages at the same time that they rip away money from families.

  Here in Australia we can actually judge the impact of carbon pricing by what has happened. We can judge the impact directly by what has happened since carbon pricing came into effect. What we know is that, since carbon pricing came into effect, we are seeing reductions in emissions - that is, it is working to cut carbon pollution; we have seen the number of jobs grow - 158,000 jobs have been added to the economy since the introduction of the carbon price; and we have seen investment continue not only in resources but also in other sectors of our economy.                 We know what the impact on cost of living is. That is already being experienced. In stark contrast to the fearmongering of the Leader of the Opposition during the days of carbon pricing, when he claimed that there would be an astronomical increase in the cost of living, what has actually happened is exactly what was predicted - which means of course that when we have put in place tax cuts, family payments increases and the pension increase, these have assisted families and, particularly for many families in low- and middle-income situations, they have received more assistance than they need to deal with cost-of-living impacts.                 So there is no need to theorise about all of this; we actually know what carbon pricing means in our economy. It means economic growth continues. It means the number of jobs continues to grow. It means investments continue to grow. It means that the cost-of-living impacts are exactly what was predicted, which means that many millions of families are in fact better off.                 What is less clear and less known, of course, is the impact of the opposition's so-called direct action policy, where there can be penalties put on firms which would inevitably be passed through to consumers and hit their cost of living, and where you do not know how big the impact will be on our economy as a result of the uncertainty that will be generated. What we do know is that the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister who asked the question are promising a world of uncertainty for Australian businesses and families whereas, under this government, Australian businesses and families know that carbon pricing is working and that none of the fear campaign led by the Leader of the Opposition has in any way come true. The Leader of the Opposition has been unmasked as simply not credible whenever he speaks about carbon pricing.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for her question and for all of the support that she provides to schools in her electorate. She has been, I know, very engaged with the school-improvement agenda and the better-funding agenda, for New South Wales schools and schools around the country, that the government is committed to. As this parliament now sits, I think it is very important we recognise where the debate about school funding and school improvement is up to. The government is absolutely committed to making sure that our schools are in the top five in the world by 2025. That means we want our teachers, classrooms and children to be properly resourced, not just now but for generations to come, so that they can have the money necessary to pay for literacy and numeracy coaches, specialist staff and the equipment that they need.                 I am very pleased that I was able to enter into an agreement with Premier O'Farrell, who knows that the current funding model is broken and who did not want to see his schools falling behind. We have, since entering into that agreement, heard a lot of ridiculous claims about what the agreement with New South Wales means. We have been told that Barry O'Farrell has been conned and that it is a very bad deal. Fortunately, Premier O'Farrell has answered that, and answered that directly. Then the Minister for Education in New South Wales went on his own campaign of myth busting and has made it very clear that the extreme claims being made by the opposition about our school-funding agenda are simply untrue. The minister in New South Wales, a National not a Liberal, has mythbusted the opposition's claims about indexation. He simply said it was wrong to suggest indexation - which is determined by average government school recurrent costs - under the present model would be as high as that claimed by the shadow minister for education. He has gone on to say that the deal in New South Wales with this government is better than the status quo and better than anything the shadow minister for education has indicated he is prepared to offer. He has said very clearly schools are better off under this government and, of course, that is true.                 What we do know as well is that the Leader of the Opposition, and many in the opposition, are going in hard behind the scenes to try to prevent other conservative states signing up to a plan that is better for schools and better for children. One asks: what type of person is it who would lobby behind the scenes to see schoolchildren denied the best possible funding for their classrooms? Despite that negativity and those bullyboy tactics, we will get on with the job of ensuring we improve every classroom for every child.

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. Here they go again, attacking the Treasury and attacking Treasury officials. We have seen it for weeks and weeks and weeks. They go out there and attack Treasury officials because that is going to be their smokescreen for their failure to put forward any detailed, costed policy for the future. Now when the Secretary of the Treasury went out last week, he ripped away the last remaining fig leaf from the shadow Treasurer and made it very clear that the forecasts that are in the budget are the forecasts of our professional advisers, the same people who advised those opposite when they were in government. And this question is simply at piece with their continued attack on the professionalism of the Treasury because they have never forgiven the Department of the Treasury and the department of finance for blowing the whistle on their $11 billion hole after the last election. All that this is about is sour grapes, but it is something much more than that -                      This is an out-and-out attack on the Treasury, on the professional advice that they provide to the government, because they will not put forward costed policies as we go through to the next election because they know if the Australian people know what they are going to do no-one would ever vote for them. And that is what this is all about: hiding very big cuts which will go right to the bone and trying to get through an election campaign without detailing in a costed way their policies. They now have a secure bottom line. There is nothing to stop those opposite, if they think the government is spending too much, to detail how much they will cost. There is nothing to stop it right now from walking into this House and doing that in the context of these figures which -                      It is very clear what sort of agenda we are dealing with here. It is an agenda to attack the Treasury and its professional officials. The fact is the shadow Treasurer is referring to projections in the forward estimates, and it is entirely professional for the Treasury to do it that way.

  I thank the member for Bass who, like Labor members on this side, has seen such incredible investment in education in his electorate: $86 million, 25 classrooms, seven libraries, seven science or language centres refurbished, four trades training centres, eight schools benefiting in Bass, 7,200 families benefiting from the Labor schoolkids bonus that Mr Abbott wants to take away. So the budget did make a clear choice about investing in a national plan for school improvement. We choose to invest $9.8 billion in the future. Add that to states' investment and you will get over $14 billion in additional investment in schools around Australia linked to the reforms that we know make such a big difference in schools. So I welcome the Tasmanian Labor government's decision to allocate some extra resource funding in the state budget for school reforms. If they agree on a national plan for school improvement with the Commonwealth with the amounts that we put in here, Tasmanian schools would see about an extra $400 million in funding over the future for things like literacy and numeracy coaches, homework clubs and the like, things that are entirely geared to making sure that Tasmania has got a well-trained, well-educated workforce for the high-skilled jobs of the future.                 I am asked about the impact on this investment and what happens if it does not flow, which of course is the policy of those opposite. The fact is that Tasmanian students will not get that support under Mr Abbott's proposals at the moment. There has been a lot of confusion about the opposition's views on education and the National Plan for School Improvement but I could not help but notice their discussion paper called Building a strong, prosperous Tasmania. The Leader of the Opposition put together a working group, went down to Tasmania and listened to the community to come up with a vision for the future.                     So it was a paper called Building a strong, prosperous Tasmania. I had a quick look at it. Now who would be surprised that, following a consultation by the Leader of the Opposition, there is not one mention of education or schools in this paper at all - not one? The link between education and prosperity has not dropped into their thinking over there.                      If we want a fairer and smarter nation, we know that one of the surest ways to get us on that path is to invest in education, and that is what the debate in this parliament is about, that is what Gonski is about and that is what our plan for the future is about: investing in a national plan for school education so that the kids in our schools get good jobs in the future, not about cutting education to the bone like Mr Abbott wants to do.

  We have now had a repeat of the attack on the Treasury forecast, this time from the shadow finance minister. Let the Hansard record another attack on the Treasury by the finance spokesman and another attack on the Treasury by the shadow Treasurer today. Why is this happening? This is happening because they want to erect a Trojan Horse which will cover up the fact that they are not going to have their policies costed and detailed and put before the Australian people before the election. What they are doing is following the Campbell Newman playbook. The Campbell Newman playbook was: don't tell the people of Queensland what you are going to do before the election. Then, if you get elected, you have an audit commission. Then you sack 14,000 people and you hack away -                      The MRRT is forecast to raise $5.5 billion over the forward estimates. How much would the opposition raise? Zero, absolutely zero! So for them to turn their noses up at MRRT revenue also shows how irresponsible they are and how they are driven by ideology. That ideology is very simple: get stuck into working people and get stuck into the benefits that working people receive from government, which is exactly what they are about to do by ripping away the schoolkids bonus.                  Look at their paid parental leave scheme. They are going to give $75,000 to millionaires and rip away the schoolkids bonus from people on modest wages. What does that say about their priorities?                     I will tell you what it says about their priorities. They are quite happy to get rid of the MRRT, which is a tax on super profits and works as it should: when they go up, it taxes; when they go down, it does not. We just happen to have had in the second part of last year the biggest drop in commodity prices that we have seen in many, many years. But that does not mean to say that an MRRT or a PRRT is not an important tax to have in our system to make sure the Australian people get value from the minerals they own 100 per cent. Those opposite do not have that belief. They think these are owned by the companies themselves and the individuals. They are quite happy to give them a free go. We on this side of the House will always do the right thing by people on low and middle incomes and we will keep doing it.

  I thank the member for Moreton for his question. He is a big supporter of infrastructure projects like the Ipswich Motorway and the Cross River Rail in Brisbane. We are investing real money for real projects to make a real difference to communities right across Queensland - projects like the Cross River Rail, recommended by Infrastructure Australia because it stacks up; a project that will take 14,000 cars off Brisbane streets and allow an extra 17,000 people to travel on the rail network during peak hours. It has benefits for western and northern suburbs of Brisbane as well as the Gold and Sunshine coasts. It is a smart investment for our future that will keep our economy strong.                 This did not come out of nowhere. This took two years of negotiation, a 2,000-page submission from the Queensland government, face-to-face meetings between ministers as well as discussions between our respective departments. What happens when you have an agreement between different levels of government is that you have an exchange of letters. I have here a letter from Scott Emerson, the Queensland minister. He asked for the project to be delivered as a PPP: we agreed. He asked for $715 million from each level of government: we agreed. He asked for 50-50 funding towards the availability payment: we agreed. He asked for the Queensland government to cover the operating costs: we agreed. He asked for the Australian government to guarantee private sector debt: we agreed. He had a final condition, that the project be subject to concessional treatment with the Australian government payments, and we agreed.                 Each and every ask: we agreed. The state asked and we delivered. They got exactly what they asked for. I table the letter from Minister Emerson and I table my response, agreeing to the position, on behalf of the government. We have had a position, as a result of the opposition's intransigence and statements to the Queensland government, whereby they put their political interests before the interests of people in Brisbane and those who are stuck in congestion in South-East Queensland. We have firmly put our position on the table. The Queensland government agreed and we are in a position to move forward. But the opposition says, 'Don't fund any public transport.' So the Queensland government, in spite of the fact that the MOU had been agreed to by both departments, has now walked away from that project, meaning that there will be gridlock in Brisbane and South-East Queensland in the coming years.

  During the course of question time we have spoken about the budget numbers and the Secretary of the Treasury's verification that had the pre-election fiscal outlook been produced on budget night it would have had the same figures in it. Yet again, we have the opposition attacking Treasury. Why are they doing that? They are doing that because on many occasions they have engaged in this game of saying that they cannot be clear with the Australian people about their cuts to the bone until they see the pre-election fiscal outlook during the formal campaign period. Unfortunately for the opposition, that excuse has now just been shattered. The opposition now know that the numbers in the budget are the numbers that they should be working against.                 For every expenditure that the opposition says it wants to engage in it should nominate a saving. When it repudiates $5.5 billion of mining tax revenue, where is the matching cutback? When it repudiates more than $20 billion of carbon pricing revenue, where is the matching cut? That is the position that the opposition is in, so before any other opposition spokesperson comes to the despatch box and points to budget numbers they should have the honesty and the decency to verify when the Australian people will hear from them and where their cuts to the bone will fall. How much out of Medicare? How much out of hospitals? How much out of schools? How much out of family payments?                     That is the task for the opposition, not these continuing disgraceful attacks on Treasury.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. Around one in five Australians have told the Human Rights Commission that they have experienced race hate talk such as verbal abuse, racial slurs or name calling. More than one in 20 Australians say that they have been physically attacked because of their race. These are concerning statistics, and I am sure they will be of concern to all those in this House. Our government is committed to standing up against racial hatred in Australia. We believe that speech based on racial hatred must not be tolerated. Racist hate speech is a threat to the dignity of individuals, to communities and, ultimately, to the security of the Australian people. We all know from bitter experience what hate speech can lead to.                 In 1994 the Keating government introduced hate-speech provisions into the Commonwealth Racial Discrimination Act. In introducing these laws the then Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch, was clear about their purpose, saying:                 The Racial Hatred Bill is about the protection of groups and individuals from threats of violence and the incitement of racial hatred, which leads inevitably to violence.                 _   _   _                 No Australian should live in fear because of his or her race, colour or national or ethnic origin.                 For almost 20 years these provisions have served these noble purposes, helping to protect Australians and everyone in the Australian community by making hate speech unlawful. The provisions have been used in a number of serious cases, including to prevent Holocaust deniers from publishing their poisonous falsehoods. Freedom of speech is also a value that the Australian Labor Party holds dear, and that is why our laws against hate speech contain broad defences to ensure that open debate and political communication in our country are not unnecessarily constrained.                 In April this year, the Prime Minister demonstrated our government's commitment to stand up against hate speech and discrimination by signing on behalf of our nation the London Declaration on Combating Antisemitism. The declaration commits its signatories to take meaningful legislative action to combat not only anti-Semitism but also discrimination against any minority, and in particular the declaration commits parliamentarians to legislate effective hate crime legislation and make illegal incitement to racial hatred. We already have such laws in Australia in the form of the hate speech provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, and I welcome the decision of coalition members to follow the Prime Minister's lead in signing the London declaration. I very much hope that this means that we have bipartisan support for laws that already prohibit hate speech in our nation.

  Thank you very much. To the Leader of the Opposition I can certainly say that all our agencies are in a position to keep our country safe with the resources that they have. I believe it is very important when we are talking about resources that we actually have the facts on the table, so let us go through the facts.                     I reject any suggestion that funding to Australia's intelligence agencies has been cut.                      Well, I did assume the Leader of the Opposition was raising a serious issue, not something for political catcalling, so I hope that when we are talking about national security we may see a little decorum on the opposition back benches and the front bench otherwise people will conclude that they are not at all interested in national security. They are just interested in a bit of cheap politics.                 But if they are genuinely interested in national security, then they would be genuinely interested in the facts. The parliamentary committee review tabled yesterday relates to the 2010-2011 budgets of the Australian intelligence community, that is, the budgets that were announced by the Treasurer more than three years ago. As announced in the 2013-14 budget, from 1 July the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation will receive an increase of $32.3 million, a 10 per cent rise in funding. Since coming to government in 2007, this government has increased funding for ASIO from $291 million in 2007-08 to $369 million in 2013-14. That represents a funding increase of 27 per cent. Over the same period the average staffing level for ASIO has increased from 1,349 to 1,778, a 32 per cent increase. So I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that before he makes any wrong claims about resourcing our national security, he checks the facts. Since coming to office the government has invested around $18 billion from 2008-09 to 2013-14 on national security matters.                 On the question of Four Corners last night, there were a number of unsubstantiated allegations of hacking in the Four Corners report. As the Attorney-General has stated, neither he nor the Director-General of ASIO intend to comment further on these inaccurate reports in accordance with the long-standing practice of both sides of politics not to comment on very specific intelligence matters.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. By now members of the House will be aware that agents of the Australian Federal Police and the New South Wales Police Force last night arrested a 23-year-old man in Sydney. The man is charged with using a carriage service to make a threat and threatening to cause harm to a Commonwealth official. He has been refused bail. Speaker, I do not intend to comment on the specifics of this case as it is before the courts, but I do want to make some more general remarks about Australian national security at this time.                 In recent days Australians have seen the footage of an horrific attack in London on an individual soldier, and I think that members across the House would acknowledge, as I most certainly do, that that footage contained some of the most disturbing images I have ever seen. The implication of this incident for Australia has been considered by our National Security Committee. Of course an incident like this emphasises the effective and ongoing preventative work of federal and state agencies in countering similar terrorism threats to Australia. We all rely on their work, necessarily done without fanfare or publicity, and they have served us all well in the past 12 years.                 We must also remember the importance to that work of the continuing support and cooperation of both the leadership of Australia's Muslim communities and the Australian Muslim community as a whole. These Australians are very committed to our inclusive, diverse and tolerant society and without their engagement and support our intelligence agencies would be much less well advised about extremist elements and individuals. What this shows is what we said in the National Security Statement, that the continuing threat of terrorism always has the capacity to shock and surprise us.                 I can also advise the House that the Chief of the Defence Force, General Hurley, has provided specific advice to Defence Force personnel regarding the need for enhanced security awareness and vigilance. I wish to emphasise Australia's terrorism alert level remains unchanged at medium and the government will continue to work to secure Australia against terrorist threats.

  What we see from the opposition is the cheapest playing of politics. Indeed, when the shadow minister for immigration raised similar spectres to this he was quickly repudiated by members of the opposition backbench and the shadow Treasurer refused to associate himself with those remarks. So it will be interesting to see today whether or not opposition members of goodwill are prepared to associate themselves with the implications of the Leader of the Opposition's question.                 What the Leader of the Opposition well knows is the following: No. 1 - he came to the parliament and voted for more boats; No. 2 - the Australian government, of course, operates a system where there are detention arrangements and security work undertaken. The Leader of the Opposition knows that. For the Leader of the Opposition to try to raise fear and alarm in the community about these matters is truly disgraceful, one of the new lows in Australian politics, and I trust he will not continue down this ugly path and, if he does, that those members of the opposition who have been prepared to stand up and be counted for decency in the past will do it again.

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his very important question, because today we have had a timely reminder of why it is important to get the big, long-term decisions right for the future of the country. Today we have had the Better Life Index published by the OECD, which shows that Australia is the best country in which to live and work in the global economy. I know everybody on this side of the House is proud of that result, and we know if we want to keep it that way we have to keep getting the big economic decisions right, just as we did during the global financial crisis and just as we have done in our recent budget. Always supporting jobs and growth, because when you are always supporting jobs and growth you are strengthening the underlying resilience of your economy. They are the conditions in which you can put in place the very big reforms for the future, to keep reforming your economy for tomorrow.                 That is what we have done in the recent budget because budgets are really about choices, and in the recent budget we made two very significant choices: to put in place the long-term savings to fund a major reform of our education system, to improve our schools, which will benefit our country for decades to come; and we put in place savings to fund disability care, to make our country fairer. These decisions have to be taken and they have to be taken from a position of budgetary strength. This government put in place the savings that are required to do that, and today we have had a demonstration from those opposite of how ill-equipped they are to do that.                 We have heard a lot from them about how they are supposedly supporting savings in the budget; we have heard a lot from the shadow Treasurer about what he is going to do. But today in the party room he was again rolled by the member for Menzies. He was again rolled by the member for Menzies when it came to our initiative to pay an additional sum to young mums on the birth of their babies. Rolled by the member for Menzies, as he was back in March. Rolled by the member for Menzies, and rolled again on another very important piece of legislation delivering long-term savings to fund disability care, rolled on lifetime cover in the private health insurance area - so in both those areas.                 What we have seen is a lack of discipline and what we have seen is a lack of transparency, because they do not want to tell the Australian people what they will do to fund their promises. They want to hide it all the way through to the election and do a Campbell Newman. If they are elected, they will have a commission of cuts and that will be when the Australian people will find out about their cuts to the bone.

  To the Leader of the Opposition: the facts are the facts. I have taken the Leader of the Opposition to the facts for ASIO - that is, a 27 per cent funding increase since 2007-08; a 32 per cent increase in staffing. I take the Leader of the Opposition to some more facts.                     Thank you very much. When we are talking about budget figures, then I think it pays to look at the budget and the clear facts that are revealed there. I have outlined those facts to the House.                 Can I take the Leader of the Opposition to these facts in another way? The Leader of the Opposition, I know, is familiar with the Australian government general government sector average staffing levels. I know he is familiar with that because he has gone to these numbers in the past. For example, in March this year in a media interview he referred to these numbers specifically and said, 'We don't need the extra 20,000 Commonwealth -                      Thank you very much. I am asked about intelligence staffing, and I am coming -                      Thank you very much, and I am answering the Leader of the Opposition's question about intelligence staffing and people who work in national security. I am referring him to a set of figures I know he is familiar with, because he referred to them -                      I am very happy to be relevant. The question necessarily raises issues about intelligence, budget and staff. It necessarily raises that and I am going directly to that, but I am using a figure I know the Leader of the Opposition is familiar with because he referred to these figures in a media report in March this year where he said, 'We don't need the extra 20,000 Commonwealth public sector employees revealed in these budget papers'. The Leader of the Opposition ought to acknowledge that those figures show 7,500 extra defence military personnel -                      2,400 extra defence reservists, extra AFP and extra ASIO staff. So of the 20,000 public servants he wants to get rid of, 12,200 of them work in our security services. So if the Leader of the Opposition wants to have a debate about staffing in security, he can answer to the Australian people what would happen with Australia's national security if he took those 12,200 people away.

  To the member's question, I absolutely confirm to him that I accept the science of climate change. I absolutely confirm to him that I accept that science, as I accept other scientific conclusions. Consequently that means that I understand that carbon pollution, in particular, is making a difference to our climate and so if we are to tackle climate change then we need to tackle carbon pollution in our atmosphere. It is that that has driven the government's policy about carbon pricing, because we believe that the cheapest, most effective way of reducing carbon pollution is by pricing it and we believe in terms of the government's carbon pricing scheme and Renewable Energy Target that the evidence is already in, that it is working to reduce carbon pollution. I absolutely accept the science and do not believe that it is possible for a person of reason to have any other view.

  Thank you very much, Speaker. I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. Following the Leader of the Opposition's recent rant, it is the right question to be asking. It is good to hear the Leader of the Opposition back to his negative best, back to his over-claiming, back to his ridiculous claims about the effect of carbon pricing on our economy. It is good to see the Leader of the Opposition back to claiming that this is a 'wrecking ball in our economy', when we know that our economy has continued to grow with carbon pricing and when we know that more than 150,000 jobs have been created since carbon pricing came into effect.                 It is good to hear the Leader of the Opposition back to his best when he misclaims the impact of cost-of-living changes from carbon pricing. We have all been through the 'astronomical increases in the cost of living', where of course the change in the cost of living is exactly what was anticipated. And the Leader of the Opposition finally had to concede that he could not take away from families the assistance that had been provided to them, because it was making millions of families better off.                 It is good to hear the Leader of the Opposition back to his best, too, when he is trying to deny the fact that government policies between carbon pricing and the renewable energy target have meant that carbon pollution is coming down. To take one example of that: emissions from electricity are already down by 7.7 per cent in nine months.                 But why I particularly appreciated the Leader of the Opposition's address today is I sat here yesterday in question time bemused by the interventions of the shadow Treasurer. I was absolutely bemused by those interventions. The Leader of the Opposition has been going around the country with his fear campaigns - 'Whyalla wiped off the map'; 'This great big new tax'; 'This wrecking ball in our economy' and on and on it has gone - and then the shadow Treasurer comes in yesterday and he is chiding the Deputy Prime Minister because the carbon price is, in his view, 'vanishingly small'. Well, it cannot both be true, can it - a 'huge wrecking ball' and 'vanishingly small'? Who is in charge on the opposition frontbench - the Leader of the Opposition with, 'Its so big' or the shadow Treasurer with 'Its so small'?                 To the shadow Treasurer who came in with that critique yesterday: one wonders why he would bother abolishing a tax which he is chiding for being too small. One question the opposition has never answered, though - and this is the key question for the forthcoming election - is whether their direct action policy is going to reduce carbon pollution at a cheaper rate per tonne than the government's policy? Answer that question and then we will know exactly what the opposition's plan is.

  For obvious reasons I am not going to canvas an individual example. I trust that those opposition members who in the past have come forth in support of decency when the shadow minister for immigration has been out in the community trying to raise these kinds of fears again come forth. I hope that those members of the opposition do step forth, because what we are seeing from the opposition here is an ugly campaign to try to raise fear in the Australian community. It is a very ugly campaign. Coming here with false claims about national security, when it is actually the Leader of the Opposition who wants to take 20,000 jobs out of the public sector, including in national security; coming in here with false claims designed to raise fear in the community -                      Let us name this ugly campaign for what it is. From the government's point of view, of course, what we will do and continue to do is to make appropriate security arrangements for Australians with our security agencies resourced as I have described to the House today.

  I thank the member for Lyons for his question and his advocacy on this important cause. I know a number of members of the parliament and so many community members beyond the parliament have been very taken by the cause of eradicating polio from our planet and have put a lot of their own personal efforts into advocating polio eradication and raising money to eradicate polio. I remember as a young person, older children, admittedly, within my school who had had a personal battle with polio. I think members of the parliament would remember that Kim Beazley, who served here with such distinction and continues to serve our nation, fought his own battle with polio as a child.                 Our nation has been a leader in eradicating polio, thanks to the work of a great Australian Sir Clem Renouf, who led the international Rotary campaign to vaccinate every Australian child against polio. That campaign has had a lot of success. In the modern world, polio only exists in four nations, which means that we can see the end is in sight when polio will be eradicated in the same way that we eradicated smallpox from the planet.                 I was very pleased today to meet again - I have had the opportunity to meet him before - with Bill Gates. Bill and Melinda Gates, through their foundation, do remarkable work towards the end of eradicating polio. There is US$1.8 billion that the Gates foundation is contributing for the Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan. This private contribution makes up one-third of the total international budget for polio eradication. For private individuals to be donating at that level is truly impressive indeed. We would all give thanks that there are individuals prepared to put so much of their wealth and resources into such a good cause.                 Governments need to partner too, and we have been partnering. We allocated $50 million to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative from 2011 to 2014. I announced that in October 2011. I am delighted to announce today that Australia will provide $80 million over four years, from 2015 to 2018, to help finish the job, so that our ongoing contributions are seamless from what we have already announced and we can keep putting resources in to eradicate this dreadful scourge around the world. Four countries to go; we can make a difference and our nation will be proudly doing so.

  I thank the member for Page for her question. I know how passionate she is about Closing the Gap. She has seen significant investment in her electorate, improving 29 libraries, 19 multipurpose halls and nine science and language centres in education. But for Indigenous students, whether they are in the member's electorate or around Australia, the delivery of additional support under A National Plan for School Improvement will be absolutely critical.                 It is National Reconciliation Week, and I know that schools around the country will be embarking on a range of different activities to highlight that important event. I was with Minister Macklin, Minister Dreyfus, the Leader of the Opposition and others on Sunday morning in Melbourne at the start of the Journey to Recognition. When we look at education and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, we can take some heart that we have intermittent progress in some areas. We are seeing some good gains in some areas in reading and numeracy at rates of improvement that are welcome. Likewise, we are seeing some good levels of attainment for Indigenous students as they finish year 12. But it is still patchy and there are some very big challenges in front of us, in particular if we look at the average performance of Indigenous students in reading and numeracy. They are two to three years below the average of other students in the nation. In the Northern Territory, the gap is equivalent to around four years.                 These are the reasons why we need a loading to specifically support Indigenous students. That was part of the Gonski recommendations and it is part of A National Plan for School Improvement which would see $5.5 billion of the total public funds directed to support around 200,000 Indigenous students in around 8,000 schools. Of course, this is part of the higher expectations that many in the community and in the teaching sectors want to see for Indigenous students: kids making the effort, families committed to education. Particularly, we need a plan that provides the structure, the certainty and the funding support to deliver reforms over time that will make a difference for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. In short, for these students, education is a passport out of poverty. It is particularly important that we have targeted investment and things like individual learning plans, making sure that we have the specific support in the early years of school for these students so they go on to be confident learners. New South Wales, incidentally, has shown the way by signing up to our plan and delivering a better deal for almost 54,000 Aboriginal students in that state.                   I think we agree that Indigenous people can no longer not be recognised in our Constitution, and we understand that building a better life for Indigenous students has its foundation in school, but we now need A National Plan for School Improvement that delivers that commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students.

  Point No. 1: I refer the member who asked the question to everything that I have said in question time about the resourcing of our security agencies, including the increased resourcing in ASIO. I ask him, if he is capable of doing so, to absorb the facts. No. 2: in terms of proposals for cutting back national security efforts, the one that is clearest in my mind is the Leader of the Opposition's proposal to reduce the public sector by 20,000, pointing to 20,000 growth as unacceptable and therefore pointing to a growth in ASIO, AFP and Defence personnel -                      I was asked about security resourcing and I am being relevant to that section of the question. I am saying that I think it is a good thing that we have more Defence personnel than we used to. I think it is a good thing that we have more reservists than we used to. It is a good thing that we have more AFP than we used to. And it is also a good thing that there are more people employed in ASIO than there used to be. I would certainly not be advocating, as others in this parliament have, that that should be cut to the bone.                 On the question of notification of police, police can always get information which they require. I refer the member to the shadow minister for immigration who, at an earlier point this year, floated a proposal for notification of communities. When the shadow Treasurer was asked about this proposal the best he could say was, 'That is an issue for debate.' When the member for McMillan was asked about this proposal he said that the kind of vilification -                      I have indicated that police can get the information they need and I am now going to reactions to proposals about notifications. The proposal was put out by the shadow minister for immigration. The shadow Treasurer distanced himself from it -                      The member for McMillan described it as the kind of vilification of asylum seekers that is unacceptable in this nation. Senator Brandis denied ever discussing it with the shadow minister for immigration. Parliamentary secretary Scott Ryan said that he is not familiar with the detail, and it all ended up with a rather embarrassing admission from Tony Jones that it was the shadow minister's proposal - his own proposal - and he acknowledged that on the opposition benches people were not prepared to stand alongside it. So if we are going to have this kind of material put before the House then let us have all of it put before the House, including that members of the opposition have been revolted by policy suggestions put forward by the shadow minister for immigration, and for good reason.

  Good government is about making the right choices and that is what we have done in the area of health. We are making choices to build a smarter, stronger and fairer nation, and that includes our area of health. The opposition want to cut to the bone. They want to cut $1.2 billion out of Medicare Locals -                    The member for Cowan then left the chamber.                     like the one in the member's electorate that is delivering after-hours GP services. We are investing in better primary health care. Our 2013-14 budget is a record investment in hospitals, cancer care and mental health funding. This week is Kidney Health Week. We saw yesterday increased support for GPs doing kidney function tests on diabetics and, from 1 July, our six weeks of paid leave will start for living donors.                  Tomorrow is MS Day. Last week, we announced $1 million of extra funding for MS research, a very important contribution. Members on this side know that, to pay for those very important investments, we need to have a sensible and rigorous approach to finding savings. We need to choose; we need to prioritise. We means-tested the private health insurance rebate some time ago, saving $100 billion over 40 years. And now the House is considering two other private health insurance measures.                 I was very pleased about reports that the coalition will back one of these measures. I see in the media today that one of the measures will receive support from the coalition. What is really curious is that one will receive support and one will not. Another measure here is with respect to Lifetime Health Cover. A fine is imposed on people who delay taking out private health insurance but who currently receive a subsidy from the government. The coalition are going to knock over that change. They are going to knock over that saving. I ask members: in what other area where the government imposes a fine does the government then pick up 30 per cent of that fine? It is like imposing a speeding ticket or a parking fine and then going and paying 30 per cent of that speeding ticket or parking fine. It makes no sense at all. Together, these two measures will save $1.1 billion. That is money for the kids dental program Grow Up Smiling, and it is money for DisabilityCare. You cannot support the spends - and the opposition say they support these spends - and then oppose the saves that pay for them.                  Government is about choices. It is about the right choices. Sometimes that means the right choices in savings, savings that pay for priorities such as the kids dental program Grow Up Smiling, and DisabilityCare. These are programs that will change the lives of millions of Australians in years to come - 3.4 million children and 400,000 people with disabilities. If you back the spends, you must back these savings.

  To everybody in the parliament now and to everybody listening to this broadcast, it is absolutely apparent to all what the opposition are trying to do. If you say a falsehood often enough, they hope that you confuse people and get them to believe that it is the truth.                 We have seen this tactic from the opposition before, when they have raised fear about other things and then the Leader of the Opposition has ended up looking idiotic as a result.                     I was addressing that section of the question that falsely claimed that there had been cuts. I have given the parliament the figures on more than one occasion today. The opposition of course came in with their strategy - no work done, too hard for them. 'Get out the budget.' 'Oh, it makes my head hurt.' So what do they do? They just come in with a false claim and, despite the facts having been laid out in front of them time and time again in question time, they lack the intellect or the wit to change the strategy. Or they are hoping that if they go through falsehoods time after time after time, then they might get someone to believe those falsehoods. So my first answer to the member is that the claim made in her question is false and, if she wants to be honest with people, she should not repeat it.                  Then on the second part of her question, the member opposite ought to have heard of an expert panel, involving Angus Houston, Paris Aristotle and Michael L'Estrange. She ought to have heard of that. She ought to have heard of their 22 recommendations, which the government accepted in full. She ought to have heard that one of those recommendations was that we made sure there was no advantage by getting on a boat and, consequently, as a result of making sure that there is no advantage to getting on a boat we do not want to see people getting protection outcomes more quickly than if they had stayed where they were and were processed where they were.                 That explains what the member went to in her question. I believe that you should not be put in an advantage position because you got on a boat. Maybe the member does not agree with me on that. That is a legitimate debate, but that is what is informing the government's policy, guided by experts, whose recommendations we have accepted in full.

The member, who is a proud advocate of the Blacktown community and the NBN, was present. I note also the recent article from the Blacktown Advocate that said, 'Blacktown an NBN town divided.' That article spoke about how if the opposition policy gets up there will be some people in Blacktown with high-speed broadband and some people without high-speed broadband, some people with fibre technology and some people with copper technology to their house. The shadow minister for fraudband and the copper economy had this to say in the local paper about this. He acknowledged that the technology under their plan would need to be upgraded down the track. So it is now acknowledged that you would put in a second-rate system knowing that you are passing on to future generations the need to upgrade the system.                     He just doesn't get it. How awful, says the Leader of the Opposition. Why not try to get it right the first time and use 21st century technology rather than 19th century technology that was put in by the PMG? That is where they are stuck. The problem is that those opposite will create a digital divide in communities right around the country. They think it is all about downloading but it is about uploading. This is as short-sighted as the famous quote of the late 1970s by Ken Olsen, who said, 'There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.' We know today how fast technology has moved on. We know how vital the infrastructure of the 21st century is. We need to compete in the Asian century -                     -                      The shadow minister for the copper economy is on the ball. It might be that he gets into the 20th century before he gets to the 21st. The truth is that he was so embarrassed by his Leader of the Opposition when they launched the policy. Remember that? There is the Leader of the Opposition and Sonny Bill Williams. Is it an apparition, is it computer-generated? No idea. The rollout is happening and it is happening in Blacktown, it is happening in Marrickville today, it is happening in Vaucluse, Malcolm. They know the benefit of the NBN. It is happening right around Australia and it is important that we do not create a digital divide.                     -

  I had the opportunity yesterday to speak to the House about bullyboy conduct in education. Now I am invited to engage in some of that conduct myself. No, I do not agree with the member for Holt, but this is the nation's parliament and what happens in the nation's parliament is that people should be free to come and put a view. It does not mean that I will agree with all of the views put; in fact, sometimes, when we are getting ready for question time or as we are moving towards divisions and I am sitting in the parliament, I listen to some of the contributions made opposite and I have never heard such unmitigated rubbish and nonsense in all my life. But I would always defend their right to come to the parliament and put whatever perspective they want. So, when I listen to the climate change scepticism from those opposite, I think, 'That's their right.' When I listen to others in the parliament put views I do not agree with -                      I have indicated the facts of this matter to the parliament. The facts of this matter, as outlined by me, mean I do not agree with the member for Holt. Having said that, this is a democracy. This is the nation's parliament, and I believe that people should be able to come here and put their views. So the Leader of the Opposition is asking me to thug the member for Holt and I will not do so; I am not that kind of person.

  I thank the member for McEwen for his question. The member, like me, has made his home in regional Australia, and he sees firsthand the benefits of the government's commitment to supporting and improving our regions. Regional Australia will be the biggest beneficiary of the next phase of the government's Nation Building Program.                 Two-thirds of our infrastructure budget is going to projects in rural and regional Australia, delivering major safety and capacity improvements to roads such as the Bruce Highway, the Pacific Highway, and the Hume and Midland highways. The redevelopment of major freight corridors and freight hubs is critical to the economies and livelihoods of towns and the communities alongside them, and we are getting this job done.                 Under this government, regional communities are at the centre of the rollout of Labor's affordable high-speed broadband services. We are prioritising the National Broadband Network rollout in regional Australia, with towns like Armidale, Coffs Harbour, Gosford, Townsville, Bacchus Marsh in my own constituency, Toowoomba and Willunga already connected and reaping those benefits. These are very smart investments that will bridge the divide between the city and the regions like never before, in education, health services and economic opportunities for businesses.                 This year's budget is also delivering $300 million to bring qualified early-childhood professionals to regional Australia and ensure that they stay - a fair and responsible investment for kids in regional Australia, making sure they get access to the same services as those in the cities and that they can learn and develop to their full potential. This is on top of Labor's Building the Education Revolution. We are proud to have delivered the state-of-the-art classrooms and facilities to towns that have never dreamed of having access to such assets. There are small rural communities with access to libraries that have never had that before; electronic whiteboards in small rural schools - important investments.                 We are prioritising regional health services: 25 regional cancer centres providing world-class treatment to over 7½ thousand patients annually and more than 127,000 additional chemotherapy students each year, bridging the divide in health outcomes to rural and regional cancer patients.                 People in regional Australia will have a choice: a stark choice, between a government that has a plan for our regions, a plan to sustain and improve our access to high quality education and health services, to sustain and improve our services and our job opportunities, or a leader of the opposition without a plan for regional communities. The Leader of the Opposition says there will be hope, and reward and opportunity.                      Well, you may well like to peddle that across regional communities but not for regional Australia. The opposition has no plan for this nation's future, no plan for jobs, no plan for economic growth, no plan to improve regional Australia - only a hidden agenda that will slash regional services to the bone.

  I refer the Leader of the Opposition to my answers yesterday and refer him, again, to the increased funding provision for ASIO. I refer him to the 2013-14 budget: a 10 per cent increase. I refer him to the fact that, over the life of the government, our funding has increased by 27 per cent. I also refer him to the fact that the average staffing level for ASIO has increased 32 per cent over that period.

  I thank the member for Corio for his question. Of course, his focus is on jobs and growth in his electorate, in the community that he serves. I understand that, because I am working with him and the member for Corangamite and also with Maria Vamvakinou, our local members in this House who represent the communities of Geelong and the broader region, and Broadmeadows. Of course, these communities are very focused on future sources of jobs and growth, following Ford's announcement.                 Across the government's ranks we are continuously focused on jobs and growth, standing up for manufacturing workers, making sure that around the country manufacturing continues to be a source of strength in our economy not only in Geelong and Broadmeadows but around the nation. We are standing up for jobs and growth now, the way we have stood up for jobs and growth across the life of the Labor government. As a government we worked hard to protect jobs and growth during the biggest economic downturn since the Great Depression: the global financial crisis. And, through working in partnership with industry and unions, we did ensure that, compared to other nations around the world, we protected jobs, which is why when we compare ourselves to other nations around the world we see that, unlike other countries, we are continuing to grow and, unlike other countries, we are continuing to create jobs.                 We want to ensure that there are more jobs and growth for the future, which is why last night we were proud to bring to the House a bill that will focus on Australian jobs, linking local businesses to new business opportunities, supporting Australian businesses and making sure that local companies get a fair go to win contracts for major projects in infrastructure and mining.                 The bill requires that major projects worth more than half a billion dollars have to adopt Australian industry participation plans setting out how they will give local companies a chance to win contracts - that is, a chance for jobs and a chance for growth. Put simply, this means extra work and extra jobs for Australians. We brought the legislation to the parliament because it is worthy of the parliament's support. I am very pleased that our proposition, the legislation that we brought to the parliament, was passed by this House yesterday.                 I regret that it was opposed by the opposition. I believe this parliament should be united in focusing on jobs and growth. The government will always be focusing on jobs and growth because we understand how important it is to modern families around the nation that people have the benefits that come with work, and we will continue to work to create jobs.

  I have nothing further to add to the statement that I have made, but I do flag a concern here. I take my job as chair of the parliamentary joint intelligence committee very seriously. What I have observed, and what concerns me, with respect to the conduct of the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition in the past couple of days is this: that committee report was a joint report. It was a unanimous report. It was a report by consensus on two sides. I have never seen in this place, in my entire time, with one exception, national security just thrown around like it is a political plaything. And I accuse you, opposition leader, of doing so. You are the least qualified opposition leader to talk about matters of national security since Mark Latham. As to your stunt with the former director-general, Paul O'Sullivan -                     -                      Did you ask questions that breached the Intelligence Services Act? I think I would be treading very carefully if I were you. The next question would be -

  I do thank the member for his question. Every day this government is driven by the desire to support Australian jobs and to support Australian workers and, of course, we did that during the global financial crisis when we put jobs first for Australian workers. And we have done it again during our recent budget in the face of revenue write-downs. We have put jobs and growth first for Australian workers, so much so that there have been 950,000 jobs created since this government came to power. That is why we are so serious in meeting the challenges of the future particularly in terms of our jobs plan for Australia, which was voted against by those opposite in the House yesterday - a groundbreaking plan particularly to assist manufacturing industry and to create the conditions for the jobs of the future.                 We are not just concerned with jobs now. We are also concerned with the retirement plans of all Australian workers, and nothing is more important to the Australian workforce over and above their job security than what they are going to do in retirement as to their dignity in retirement and their living standards in retirement, which is why the Labor Party invented national superannuation, a system which is the envy of the world. It has played a very important part in supporting jobs, particularly during the global financial crisis, and it has strengthened our economy for the future. We are putting in place some very important superannuation reforms and from today Australians are able to get an update of how much better off they will be from Labor's superannuation reforms. They can go now and log into moresuper.gov.au to find out how much better off they will be from an increase in the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent. They can log in if they are a low-income worker and find out how much better off they will be from the $500 contribution which is going to low-paid workers. Of course, there is an alternative approach to superannuation in this House and that comes from those opposite because they have announced two policies which will attack the retirement incomes of over eight million Australian workers. In particular, there is their desire to slow the implementation of the increase in the guarantee. We know what that really means because the last time that happened it did not proceed at all. The impact there would be for someone on an average income - a 30-year-old - that they could lose $127,000 in their retirement. We know that will happen. We know that the Leader of the Opposition has said that superannuation is a con job. Now he did say that some time ago, but there is one thing he said down in Geelong only a year ago. He said this:                 Well, we strongly oppose the superannuation increase. We have always as a Coalition been against compulsory superannuation increases.                 I think what that indicates to the Australian people is a savage attack on the retirement savings of Australian workers.

  Thank you very much and to the member for Sturt: I think the member for Holt gave a very elegant answer to the parliament. In addition to that very elegant answer, let me remind the member for Sturt that, as I said in this parliament yesterday, the review tabled by the member for Holt related to the 2010-11 budgets of the Australian intelligence community. The information that I have given the parliament yesterday and today is the most recent budget information. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition, in his supplementary question, conceded that these are the facts; he conceded that I was giving the parliament facts. And the facts are as follows, that in the 2013-14 budget from 1 July there is a 10 per cent increase in funding for ASIO.                     The member who asked the question may be bored about the facts relating to national security but I think the Australian nation is entitled to the facts, as are members of parliament who are thinking through these questions seriously rather than dealing with them as political playthings. So for people who are seriously interested in national security and consequently seriously interested in the facts, the facts about ASIO are these. Since coming to government in 2007, this government has increased funding for ASIO by 27 per cent. Over the same period the average staffing level for ASIO has increased 32 per cent. I have had the opportunity now to lay those facts before the parliament on a number of occasions in answer to questions from the opposition. Their campaign here is one that is being pursued in defiance of the facts, and that means that it is a campaign being pursued for base political reasons not in Australia's national interest.

  I thank the member for his question. I know that he has an enduring interest and concern about the provision of education in his electorate and through regional New South Wales. I am aware of the matter that the member refers to, although I have not been privy to the details of the reporting of that matter. What I am advised is that it is a matter that concerns the enrolments of the schools in question. I am happy to take that part of the member's question on notice and seek clarification from the New South Wales department in respect of that matter.                 What I would additionally say though is that under the National Plan for School Improvement, we would expect to see additional resources going to schools in the member's and equivalent members' electorates where students are drawn from a lower socioeconomic background as may be the case in regional and rural Australia. And it is my expectation that those additional resources that are delivered to schools are intended to support the performance of the students in those schools, including in the schools that the member referred to. It makes perfect sense for programs of that kind to continue in that way.

  I thank the member for Reid for his question. I can inform him and other members of the House that this Gillard Labor government is doing much to improve retirement income savings of all Australians. The list bears repeating. We are increasing compulsory superannuation from nine to 12 per cent. We have abolished the 15 per cent tax that 3½ million people were paying on their superannuation contributions if they earned less than $37,000. We did that on 1 July last year. This is on top of us putting downward pressures on fees and charges in superannuation. This is on top of us abolishing the 70-year-old age discrimination bar against people over 70 getting super. This is on top of us today, barely an hour ago, lifting the concessional caps for people over 60 and 50. We are a government getting on with the business of looking after people's superannuation, and we have announced our plans to further depoliticise the long-term issues of superannuation from the day-to-day hurly-burly.                 But the member for Reid did ask me about other policies which are in existence in this place. I regret to inform the House and those listening that 16 May this year was a dark day in the history of Australian superannuation. It was the day that the Leader of the Opposition said he would freeze, he would jam, he would halt the increases in superannuation at 9¼ per cent and not increase them to 10 per cent. What do those opposite have against 8½ million Australians getting a better retirement income? It gets worse than that. The industry knows it is a problem. John Brogden, the leader of the Financial Services Council called the opposition's announcement 'a bitter disappointment, a blow to the retirement savings of all Australians'.                 But unfortunately, member for Reid, it gets worse. This mob opposite cannot keep their hands off superannuation. They are proposing to put a great big new tax on low-paid people's superannuation. They want to say, 'How stupid is that policy?' If you have take-home income, if you earn less than $37,000, your effective tax rate is 9½ per cent. But the brains trust opposite want to lift the tax on the super, which you cannot access, to 15 per cent! The effective tax rate is 9½ per cent that people earning under $37,000 pay on their take-home pay, but that mob opposite want them to pay more on compulsory savings. Whoever invented that idea should get the boot.                 But it is also stupid because those opposite want to put more pressure on the age pension. If the average Australian does not have money saved, then we are going to need to pay more in taxes. Despite the blandishments of the opposition, there is no free lunch when you are in government; you have got to do the right thing. But worst of all - not only do I not trust them to just freeze super; they will never increase super - this mob opposite would give money back to Rio Tinto and Gina and rip-off 3.6 million people with their great big new tax on superannuation.

  I thank the member for La Trobe very much for that question because this government is all about building a fairer future for Australian families. It was this government that delivered Australia's first national Paid Parental Leave scheme and 280,000 Australian families have already benefited. It is this government that has delivered the school kids bonus and that of course is helping more than one million Australian families. Making the right choices on this side of the parliament compared to those opposite, we know that those opposite want to abolish the schoolkids bonus. That would take $15,000 out of the pockets of an ordinary family over the life of their schoolchildren, while this Leader of the Opposition wants to give $75,000 to a wealthy woman to have a baby, while they rip $15,000 out of the pockets of ordinary families. That is what those opposite are offering families.                 At the moment, we are holding our breath to see whether or not the position of those opposite on the baby bonus is going to last through the afternoon because we have seen so many different positions from those opposite on the baby bonus. The Leader of the Opposition said that the baby bonus was a signature policy, that he did not like our changes to the baby bonus. The shadow Treasurer said that he did not agree with that. He rolled over the Leader of the Opposition and made it clear that he was going to oppose our new family payment for newborns. That was until he got rolled. The member for North Sydney likened the government's changes to the baby bonus to China's one-child policy. But that was of course until the member for Menzies rolled the member for North Sydney. The member for Menzies is now saying that they are going to support everything that the government's proposing on the baby bonus. We have had every single policy possible from those opposite on a baby bonus - complete and total chaos from those opposite when it comes to supporting families.                 On their paid parental leave scheme, we have seen the member for Mitchell say that their paid parental leave policy does not pass the fair-go test. The member for Moore says that the Labor Party's scheme is quite good. We have had Senator Joyce, the member for Gippsland, Senator Williams, all of them, say that the Leader of the Opposition -

  We are clearly back to the kinds of tactics that the opposition was engaged in yesterday. To the member who asked the question, Australia has operated a mandatory detention policy for some time now. The member was not here during the days of the Howard government, but if she had been she would recognise that during those days there were occasions when people left immigration detention, not in an authorised way - there were, in fact, a number of quite big break-outs under the former government.                  Under this government, we of course have worked on detention policy. Obviously from time to time there are some issues, but to ply this low road and to try to increase community concern and fear is truly a despicable thing to do. What the government do of course is engage with detention policy in a way that means we have security managed detention centres and we have security assessments for asylum seekers. The member asking the question should know that, and I would once again counsel her not to engage in this dreadfully low politics.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. She is a great advocate for education in both her electorate and abroad. The reason we must invest in the National Plan for School Improvement is that we want to set up the country well for the future. The fact is that education is a great enabler - and I have heard the member herself say that. Every member wants to see support going to the students in their electorates who need it. We also understand that it is not good enough to have students in our country being left behind by students in high-performing school systems in our region. We want to invest in quality learning, quality teaching and more school leadership. We get it.                  I am asked about other support for this investment. In fact, the New South Wales Minister for Education was in Canberra yesterday, as I understand, reportedly making a presentation to National Party colleagues on why we need the National Plan for School Improvement. Interestingly, the presentation was headed 'Benefits of school funding reform'. It says that there are persistent gaps in education outcomes that need additional investment to close those gaps. One can imagine it: the putative leader, Senator Joyce, sitting up the front, very keen; the current leader drafting a question for 'Albo'; the member for Calare ripping through a copy of The Land; and up comes the slide presentation, which says, 'Why is the current funding model broken?' because funding does not follow the students with the highest levels of educational need.                      There has never been a more eloquent statement as to why National Party members in this House ought to be supporting our National Plan for School Improvement. Here is a presentation given by a National Party education minister of a state to make that very point. The presentation went on to out the shadow minister's, the member for Sturt's, campaign of misinformation on indexation and funding growth to schools. The slide reads - and I am happy to show you for a moment - 'The full funding reforms provide higher levels of funding to all school sectors in New South Wales from 2014'.                     It goes on to say that states stand to receive billions of dollars in additional investment under the National Plan for School Improvement. So what are we left with here? A federal coalition that has been exposed by a state coalition education minister because of their campaign for misinformation. I guess the rest of us can only be left with some pretty clear conclusions. If you are a teacher, they want to sack one in seven of you. If you are a parent, they want to cut the extra support that your child needs. If you care about the future of our country, they want to cut education from now and into the future. We will deliver a National Plan for School Improvement.

  Once again on a day when the opposition could have focused on jobs and growth in this parliament -                      and perhaps sought to explain why they oppose the government's billion-dollar plan for jobs and growth and growth in manufacturing, on a day when they could have chosen to do that, instead they have gone down the low road of trying to provoke fear in the community -                      I wholly reject the assertion of the member for Sturt at the dispatch box. In relation to the member's question, we are now in the second day of the opposition going down a very low road of trying to stir up fear in the community. It is grossly unacceptable. When the opposition have gone down this path before, members of the opposition themselves have stood up to it because they have found it offensive. I can understand why those members of the opposition who have stood up to it have found it offensive.                 What I can say in response to the member's question is that the government will continue to pursue the policy that it has now, including the security assessments that are undergone. Trying to raise fear about this really is, as I said earlier, going down a very low political road.

  I thank the member for Makin for his question. I have had the great opportunity over many years to have conversations with the member for Makin about how important education and training is in his electorate and I am well aware of the understanding that he has about how significant it is for the people of Makin. In fact, only recently I was able to visit the University of South Australia with the member for Makin. We were there to announce additional funding for the Australian Indigenous Mentoring Experience, which is a tremendous organisation. They are going to be providing 750 Indigenous students across South Australia with mentors. The member for Makin and I were able to join their initial session and to see the great program roll out. I know the member for Makin will be continuing to stay in contact with those students, who were very enthusiastic about the opportunity.                 It reflects the fact that Labor governments have always understood the critical importance of providing quality vocational education and training and higher education to people to enable them to get quality, secure jobs. And it is indeed a particularly important focus as we go into the Asian century and we seek to make sure that the people of our nation have the opportunities that will arise out of those growth opportunities in our region. It does mean that the demand for high-skilled jobs will be driving a need for us to continue to focus and invest in the sector.                 I want to report to the House that one of the important ways that this government partners with business is through the National Workforce Development Fund. It is $765 million over six years, and it works with businesses, coinvesting to help them upskill their workforce. Over 30,000 workers have enrolled already and, to give you an example, there are 10 at Haigh's in South Australia doing a certificate IV in manufacturing and there are 30 staff at Morshead Home for veterans here in Canberra, who are training to help older Australians with mental health issues. And, as at 26 April, business and industry have invested $124 million in upskilling their workers in partnership with this government. We also partner with them through the Workplace English Language and Literacy Program. I must say I have visited with the member for Scullin an aged-care facility in his area that is doing some great work in providing language and literacy training to its workers.                  I would point out that people may be interested to know what the Leader of the Opposition has to say on skills and education. They often say, 'Judge us not by what we say but by what we do.' Sadly, I have to report that they do not say anything, so it is difficult to look to the statements that have been contributing to the debate about skills and education, but, if you look at what they do in government - both in previous federal and state governments - I think you would be very worried about what the agenda for the future will be.

  Clearly, the opposition now has shown what it thinks of national security: it thinks it is a joke. Because they think it is a joke they are showing they are unfit for government. The Leader of the Opposition, in sanctioning that question, is showing he is unfit to lead.                     Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:                     I am indeed, Madam Speaker. I seek leave to table a report from the Australian bodyguard deputised for Gillard, with photographs.

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question and for her very hard work to support the working parents of her electorate. I know that she, like me, would be incredibly proud that in this month's budget our government has once again provided record levels of financial assistance to help parents with their childcare costs. We know how important the sector is; we know how critical the assistance is; and we are prepared to put our money where our mouth is.                 In this budget we are investing over $22 billion in direct childcare assistance to Australian families, which is almost quadruple the amount of funding that was provided by the former government. We know that these measures are important and we know that they are working. In fact, families are clearly valuing this assistance because this week I have released figures showing that, for the first time in our nation's history, in one quarter the number of children in childcare services has hit one million. It has never been bigger and it has never been valued more by our community or by the Australian government.                 We are a government that made the choice to raise the Child Care Rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. We made a choice to increase the cap on that Child Care Rebate from $4,354 per year up to $7,500 per year. We are a government that will not cap the number of places or the number of children that we fund and support. We know how important these payments are. We know how important it is for parents as they juggle work and family. Under us, Australians can be comfortable in knowing exactly what levels of record assistance they can rely on, something that is obviously critically important when you are making decisions about your family.                 Yet the same cannot be said of those opposite. Those opposite hope to sneak to an election without revealing the savage cuts that they have in mind for childcare assistance. They tried to adopt the Campbell Newman style of 'trust us: we'll tell you after polling day just exactly what it is that we will do'. When asked directly if he would slash family childcare support, the shadow Treasurer could not and would not rule it out. So the coalition can no longer hide behind this post-election review of child care because it is now absolutely clear to everybody that the Child Care Rebate is on their chopping block and they are sharpening the axe as we speak.                 We also see reports of the Leader of the Opposition now crab-walking away from his Rolls Royce paid parental leave policy. We know that we have a very clear commitment to working parents in Australia and that there is a clear choice between families around Australia - a choice between our government, which is making record investments in child care, record investments in support, and that side opposite which would cut this assistance back the moment they got the chance.

  I thank the member for Moreton for his question. This government has a plan to make sure that hardworking Australians get a fair go. As part of this plan we have been strengthening our consumer protection laws. We have introduced for the first time a national consumer law. We have introduced unit pricing and unfair contract terms. We have been cracking down on unconscionable conduct and we have also been cracking down on the unscrupulous activities of door-to-door selling. We have criminalised cartel conduct, something that when the coalition was in government they were advised to do and refused to do it.                 Today I have asked the Commonwealth Consumer Affairs Advisory Committee to identify ways of cracking down and ending some of the unfair credit card surcharges that are slugging consumers. In fact, a survey released today by Choice indicated that a family of four flying to Bali could be stung with surcharges of up to $100 on top of their airfares. These practices are unacceptable. Whilst, of course, we will await the report from the council, our government stands ready to act and to end these rip-offs. Just as we have been standing up for hardworking Australians by shining a light on these unfair practices slugging consumers, equally we have been shining a light on unfair practices of multinational companies engaging in profit shifting. That is why in this year's budget our government handed down a package of measures, $4 billion worth of measures, to crack down on corporate tax loopholes. These tax loopholes give large multinationals an unfair competitive advantage over Australian businesses that are paying their fair share, but equally if the most profitable companies in the world are not paying their fair share of tax that means that hardworking Australians and small businesses are left to foot the bill.                 Do not expect those opposite to stand up for a fair go for hardworking Australians. In fact, they would rather give a free kick to the tax avoiders. That is what we have seen in recent times. I saw the shadow Treasurer, when giving his budget reply speech at the Press Club, saying: 'We're going to break up the ATO and water down its powers.' At a time when right around the globe revenue authorities are seeking to crack down on profit-shifting activities of multinationals avoiding paying their fair share of tax, the shadow Treasurer's answer is to go soft on them. They will go soft on tax avoiders. Only Labor will stand up for hardworking Australians.

  To the member's question, as I said in parliament yesterday, as I have said today, if our authorities and agencies in any area get legitimate requests from the police then of course they are responded to. To the member for Cook, where he is obviously alluding to is the proposal that he had some time ago about blanket protocols that was rejected by the opposition.                     I have answered the member's question. I say to the member once again - and I think the reason he got up so quickly to the dispatch box is he does not want to be reminded that in this area he put out a policy that members of the opposition backbench were disgusted by.

  I thank the member for Shortland for her question, certainly not a dibber dobber. This week the House passed five bills which give legal effect to the government's living longer, living better aged care reform package. This legislation has been the subject of very detailed work with the aged-care sector, and follows the delivery already of a number of key elements of the reform package. These include things like the design and the release of new home-care packages that are due to commence on 1 July, provided legislation passes through the other place. There are also programs that will kick in this year to provide much better support to families living with dementia, as well as better linkages between the aged-care system and the broader healthcare and palliative care sectors. There are also determinations by the new Aged Care Financing Authority about how providers will qualify for increased accommodation payments from the government, as well as a fairer and more transparent system of accommodation charges for consumers themselves.                 This element featured in many of the contributions on this debate from those opposite, who were concerned apparently that greater choice about how consumers will pay their accommodation charges will impact the viability of some providers. The Aged Care Financing Authority is obviously - I hope this goes without saying - alive to these questions of viability. This is a highly qualified group which independently provides advice which, for the first time, is transparently published on the government's website. Indeed, the Aged Care Financing Authority commissioned advice from KPMG particularly on this question of viability. This advice has been released recently on the website, last week, I think. I table this report for the benefit of the House. After the release of the advice, the Aged Care Financing Authority wrote to me providing advice on that advice. They concluded: 'The Authority supports the overall findings of the analysis that the reforms can be expected to have a significant positive impact on the overall level of refundable accommodation deposits and revenue for the industry.' I table that correspondence from the authority as well.                 These reforms will undoubtedly provide greater choice, control and flexibility for older Australians about their aged care and support needs. These reforms provide much greater emphasis on the ability of older Australians to stay at home for as long as possible, as well as responses to emerging pressures like the increasing prevalence of dementia in our communities. The government looks forward to debate on these bills in the other place, following receipt of the Senate inquiry into the bills, and then being able to get on with the job of providing the best possible care and support to Australian seniors.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. As a government we focus on competitiveness and productivity and the Leader of the Opposition ought to be aware that, in the productivity statistics in recent times, there have been some good emerging trends. There is obviously volatility in short-term figures, but I direct the Leader of the Opposition's attention to the actual facts and figures. They are not something to guffaw about; they are something to absorb.                 What makes a difference to competitiveness? A series of things. You need to have the best of infrastructure, which is why this government is making record infrastructure investments. You need to have the infrastructure of the age in which you live, not yesterday's infrastructure, which is why we are rolling out the National Broadband Network, doing it once, doing it right and doing it with fibre.                  In order to be competitive and have productivity you need working people to have the best of skills, which is why I am very proud that there are more apprenticeships and traineeships out there than ever before and that we held apprenticeships and traineeships, despite the global financial crisis where around the world so many people were thrown into unemployment and so many young people missed out on a chance of training. Here in this country, through things like the Apprentice Kickstart Initiative, we have kept apprentices and trainees getting the skills they will need for the future.                  We have also grown university places. There have never been more university places in Australia's history than there are now - a truly great thing for our international competitiveness and also for fairness to our people, because we have increased the number of people from poorer homes going to universities, something people said could not be done. But we have achieved it.                 Our school reform agenda, the National Plan for School Improvement, is about every child reaching their full potential. It is also about the strength of our national economy for the future and our competitiveness, because we simply cannot be a strong and prosperous nation in the future if our kids do not get a world-class education.                  We have also worked on a seamless national economy agenda, making sure not only that is there appropriate regulation but also that it makes sense for the national economy - things such as transport regulations not changing at state borders.                  When it comes to taxation we have ensured that we are pricing carbon in the most efficient way: a market-based mechanism. In the minerals area what we are taxing is super profits - that is, when investments are at their most profitable stage. This is an appropriate taxation response and this comprehensive suite of policies is a stark contrast to the lack of plans -

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I am absolutely delighted to announce that today I joined the Chief Minister of the ACT and together we signed our plan for better schools for the students of the ACT.                     I hear those opposite guffawing. I do not understand why they would not want to give 62,000 students who live in the ACT a better education and why they would seek to be cynical and dismissive about securing a better education for 62,000 students. For those 62,000 students joining the students in New South Wales, the biggest education system in the country, what we have done today through this agreement is make sure that they are not going to be subject over the long term to the funding model of today, which is broken. We know it is broken and, indeed, the Minister for Education in New South Wales has been very clear publicly, and when he has visited Canberra, that it is broken. As a result of this arrangement, schools in the ACT will see base funding rolled out to bring schools that are below a school resource standard to that school resource standard. We have also committed to stable indexation arrangements. We have committed to grow education by 4.7 per cent and the ACT has agreed to grow its own school budget by three per cent.                  What does this all mean? What is this money going to be used for? It is going to be used for incredibly practical things that make a difference to children's education. It will give schools the resources they need to make sure that they can engage in more one-on-one learning, giving children the help and support they need, whether it be at the front of the class or the back of the class. It will mean that schools have more resources to assist those students with special needs. It means that schools will have more resources for literacy coaches, numeracy coaches and specialised teachers. It means that schools will have more resources to support their teachers, to make sure that the teachers are high quality and that young teachers are supported to get the best of skills. Teachers are always supported to do their best in classrooms. It will mean that schools have the ability to have the equipment that makes a difference to kids education.                 I understand that to those on the other side of the House, in the opposition, all of this is viewed as boring. For the government, this is viewed as the most important work of government: investing in our children, investing in their future, and creating a stronger, smarter and fairer nation for the future. We take an 'A' step forward in the ACT today.

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for that question. It comes from a political party that aspires to be the government of Australia and is going to jack up company taxes by 1.5 per cent, making sure that our rates fall behind countries like Mexico and Spain in terms of competitiveness. So I do not think they should be coming in here and lecturing this government about competitiveness. All of the evidence says: yes, we have to attend to our tax systems; yes, they must be competitive. Clearly, those on the other side of the House do not want a competitive tax system because for some time they were also opposing our tripling of the tax-free threshold, because they do not like low-income workers. They were doing that for a while as well.                 Let us talk about competitiveness. Every single international study shows one thing: the most important thing a country can do is invest in its people, invest in education. Investing in education is the most fundamental thing a country can do to lift its productivity for the long term. That is at the centre of every international study that has been done in this area. But what is this all really about? Those opposite come into this House day after day and talk down our economy. That is a Trojan Horse for justifying their savage cuts to the bone, their aping of austerity from Europe, which they are not going to tell the Australian people about. So what they want to do is talk down our economy, generate a sense of uncertainty -                      I was asked about our economy as compared with other economies in the world, and our economy compared with other economies in the world is doing very well. But those opposite come in here day after day and talk it down. On the day that we have got a report from the OECD which shows that our economy is in good nick, which endorses the government's fiscal policy, they come in here and talk our economy down. On the day that we get a set of capex figures that show the strength of investment in the forward years not just in mining areas but also in non-mining areas, they come in here and talk our economy down.                  But the OECD report today is undeniable. It shows that we have one of the strongest-growing developed economies in the world, and everyone on this side of the House is proud of that fact. But what the shadow Treasurer does is come in here and talk the economy down. We have got a AAA credit rating from the three major rating agencies globally, something that was never done by those opposite. We have got low unemployment. We have got a strong investment pipeline. We have got record low interest rates. We have got an economy which is in good nick but which is in transition, and what our budget was about was putting in place fiscal settings which would support jobs and growth. Those opposite will never support jobs and growth because what they support is what the member for Tangney said on the door when he let the cat out of the bag: they support austerity and the loss of jobs and very big cuts to the bone.

  I thank the member for Page for that very important question. At the core of our recent budget was our decision to find the responsible savings to fund the long-term investments for the future that make our country smarter and that make our country fairer. We put in place savings to fund the school improvement program, the recommendations from Gonski. What is that all about? It is about a more prosperous country, it is about a more competitive country, but it is also about a fairer Australia. We on this side of the House believe that every child, wherever they live, whatever postcode they come from, should get the best start in life and the best chance to earn a decent income, the best chance to get a decent salary, the best chance to lift their living standards. We know and understand how much education empowers the future and is the key to future prosperity.                  This is why we have put in place a new funding model which is very important, particularly in my home state of Queensland, which will mean an additional $3.8 billion over six years. Fortunately, in New South Wales they are adopting this model because they know how good it is for Australia. There, even a National Party education minister has endorsed the model. But the cost in Queensland and the cost across the country of not implementing it will be horrendous. In Queensland government schools would lose $3 billion and non-government schools $1.2 billion.                  We have got a broken system. The Gonski report tells us it is broken; it must be fixed. But guess what? Those opposite want to hang on to a broken system which Mr Gonski has recommended should be removed to give our kids the best start in life. That is the choice that they have made. It is a shameful choice but I do respect that it is the choice they have made, but the fact is that they have done something else, and what is really reprehensible about what they have done is that they have attempted to thug the Premiers of Queensland and other states into not accepting this model. What that means is that they are stealing from the future and they are putting their political interests before the national interest. That is what they are doing. They have been out there lobbying all of their Premier mates not to adopt this policy.                     That is a shameful thing for someone who pretends to be a leader of an alternate government in this country.                     We know something about the Leader of the Opposition: he is all opposition and no leadership. The other thing that we know about him is that he likes to go the biff. He has been attempting to have this makeover - 'soft Tony'. What he has been doing behind the scenes is going the biff on the Liberal premiers to try and stop them from adopting this model.                     I withdraw. For the explanation to the people in the gallery, it is actually quite a serious issue.

  To the Leader of the National Party: first and foremost, there is a bipartisan target in this country to reduce carbon pollution by five per cent. You can do that the most efficient way, or you can do it a less efficient way. The government has chosen to do it the most efficient way. What the Leader of the National Party will never be able to do is to walk up to the dispatch box and say that the policy he stands for comes at a lesser cost to the Australian nation per tonne of carbon pollution that we reduce out of the atmosphere than the government's policy - that is, the Leader of the National Party stands for a more costly policy for the nation. So, if the Leader of the National Party is in truth in any way concerned about Australia's international competitiveness, why is it that he stands for businesses in this country - that he stands for our nation - paying more to reduce carbon pollution than the international price - because that is what he stands for? He wants to put a bigger burden on our country than the top costs that are paid internationally. You are flinching at that, but that is your policy. If you think it is unacceptable then change your policy, because that is what it is: a costly, inefficient payment to polluters. That is what the National Party leader stands for. That would be worse for competitiveness and worse for the economy. The Leader of the National Party has to acknowledge that it is a far more costly plan.                 Then, on the minerals resource rent tax, I do believe that, because the Australian people own the wealth in our ground, they are entitled to a share of that wealth when mining is at its most profitable. I understand that the Leader of the National Party and the Leader of the Opposition, given a choice between the Australian people and paying more money to those in mining - allowing them to keep all of their superprofits - would prefer to do the latter. My priority is assisting the Australian people.                 If the Leader of the National Party is truly concerned about our competitiveness then why can't he do the same thing that has been done by a National Party Minister for Education in New South Wales - a minister who actually cares -                      Yes, I am talking about the education of Australia's children, and that means I am talking about the competitiveness of our economy and its prosperity for the long term. I do understand that those opposite, because they stand for a plan which would see $16.2 billion less invested in education, are uncomfortable when we talk about the importance of education to our competitiveness, but I would say to the Leader of the National Party: take a leaf out of Minister Piccoli's book and be prepared to put Australia's children first. If one National can do that then surely another National can do that. To the Leader of the National Party: yes, that means him.

  I would like to thank the member for Melbourne for his question. I do accept that he, unlike many of those opposite, is interested in getting work-life-family balance right. But what I can report to him, to the House and to people listening is that a key objective of the Fair Work Act, which Labor brought in, is to get work-life-family balance right. We heard a meaningful and heartfelt speech from the Leader of the Opposition about the impact of work-life-family balance upon the member for Batman's statements yesterday. It is important to say those things, but it is important to mean those things.                 For the first time ever, because of a Labor government - and only a Labor government - employees have the right to request flexible working arrangements. We were the first government in Australia to ever do that, and we are proud of that. We extended it to parents of children who are under school age and to parents of children of school age with a disability. It was designed, when we introduced it, to promote genuine discussion between employees and employers. It is about getting right the process of discussion between employees and employers - balance in the workplace. What happens now is that the employee puts in the request in writing. It has to be detailed. The employer has 21 days to respond in writing to say yes or, if not, what are the reasonable business reasons why it is not happening.                 We are choosing to expand the right to request - I know the member for Melbourne supports at least this - to carers, parents and school aged children, people with disabilities who are employees, victims of domestic violence and people helping victims of domestic violence, and to mature age workers. We are also providing guidance for employers on how it should work. We believe that those amendments are worthy of support next week in the House.                 But in terms of the member for Melbourne's question, despite his question, the evidence of the experts shows that our current system is working. Eighty-one per cent of all requests have been accepted as is, another 8.4 per cent of the remaining requests were accepted with variation, and only 10 per cent of cases were rejected for reasonable business grounds. So I can assure the member for Melbourne that, under Labor, the Fair Work system is actually working. I can give some other evidence to support that. Labour productivity has been up for the last seven quarters, industrial action is down under Labor and 960,000 jobs have been created. We have had one-third of the average industrial action as opposed to those people opposite. But we know that there is a real threat to people's working conditions. We know that. Those opposite are desperately trying to hide it - the backflipping opposition, when they have a policy one day and not another the next. We know that were they ever to get the privilege of being the government of Australia they would bring back individual contracts and they would attack penalty rates. We know that they already have a big new tax on 3½ million low-paid workers. The mob opposite watched the Robin Hood film, except they barracked for the Sheriff of Nottingham. Shame on you!

  I thank the member for Wakefield for that question. In his electorate he has seen this government's commitment to supporting education - 200 Building the Education Revolution projects, improving facilities in schools; trades training centre opportunities; and Computers in Schools. This is the mark of this Labor government.                 It has been good news today and I want to applaud the leadership shown by the Chief Minister of the ACT for her vision to invest, alongside the Premier of New South Wales, in the National Plan for School Improvement. On this side of the chamber we understand that in fact schools in the bush carry much of the disadvantage in our school system. That is because quite often they are remote from services - they might be schools that do not have the opportunity to get access to good programs. It is particularly important that the National Plan for School Improvement provides for them.                 Schools in regional Australia do a good job, and I have visited some great ones - Bega Valley Public School in the electorate of Eden-Monaro, Ross Park Primary in Lingiari, Seymour College - but the broader results show us that children in the schools do not do as well as their equivalents in metropolitan Australia. Now the National Plan for School Improvement will deliver around $6 billion in extra funding for regional and remote schools in country areas over the next six years. That is because the funding model is based on need and because the needs in rural and regional Australia are great.                 I am asked why the investment is important. The fact is that if a kid gets the support in school, whether it is through an additional teachers aide, literacy coach or homework clubs, then they will do better in school. If they do better in school, they can get a better job and they can contribute to both the community and the economy of regional Australia. Our regional Labor MPs get it. The crossbench gets it - they know how important the National Plan for School Improvement is for the bush. The New South Wales Minister for Education gets it. The only people who do not get this particular fact are those opposite.                 Members opposite talk a big game - I hear them all the time - about how they profess to stand up for the bush. They are always talking about standing up for the bush and how passionate they are about rural and regional Australia. Now is the time to show how fair dinkum you are, because the National Plan for School Improvement means better education for all Australians - more funding, but particularly for students in the bush. Under Mr Abbott and Mr Pyne funding will go backwards. Under the National Plan for School Improvement funding will go forwards and land in the schools in rural and regional Australia. It is time that the National Party stood up for those students and those schools. We will deliver a National Plan for School Improvement.

  I thank the member for Corio for his question and his support for important infrastructure development which is important for his electorate, including the Regional Rail Link, the largest ever federal investment in any public transport project in Australia's history. Indeed, we have overhauled the way that we plan, prioritise finance and build infrastructure in this country. We have done it by getting the policy framework right, by establishing Infrastructure Australia which, since it was formed, has put 15 projects on the ready-to-proceed list. And all 15, as a result of the budget this year, have now been funded, with additional funding for the two managed motorways projects in Melbourne and the Melbourne Metro, and the Cross River Rail.                 In Melbourne we have allocated $3 billion for the Metro project, which is necessary to open the rail network up for the future. You need to do the Melbourne Metro as a precondition for doing anything else on the Melbourne network, including extensions with spurs to Doncaster, Tullamarine airport and, of course, Avalon Airport. Unless you fix the Metro you cannot do other measures. We had discussions with the Victorian government over many years. It has a robust case that was submitted, letters exchanged to confirm agreements, but all was undermined by this Leader of the Opposition's negativity. He not only says that he will not fund public transport projects; he is onto state governments saying they should renege on the written agreements that were done, negotiated in good faith. Similarly with the Brisbane Cross River Rail project: $715 million from each level of government, fifty-fifty funding, Australian government guarantee of private sector debt, the GST concession on both projects that was asked for. On both projects, state governments asking, we delivered; letters exchanged; smart investments to ensure that both Brisbane and Melbourne can function productively and we can do something about open congestion - but torn up because those opposite do not like anything with the word 'public' in it.                 They do not like public transport. They do not like public education. They do not like public broadcasters. They do not like the public. If it is something that has public in it they have an ideological objection to it.                    The member for Herbert then left the chamber -                      We on this side will continue to stick to our agreements. We will continue to deal with important issues such as dealing with urban congestion in our cities.

  To the shadow minister's question, what I can say is that there are two issues. There is the general issue he raises and there is a more specific issue involving New South Wales. On the more specific issue involving New South Wales I can advise the member who asked the question, and the House, that there is work happening between senior officers of the immigration department and the -                      I would have thought the member would be interested in this, that there is work happening between senior officers of the department of immigration and the assistant commissioner in New South Wales. On other issues involving police then there is ongoing work between the department and those police services.

  I thank the member for Reid for his question and I know he is very interested in making sure that all Australians have a decent retirement income. I can report to him and members of the House and people listening that the Labor government has done much to improve the retirement savings of all Australians. We have increased the superannuation payment from nine to 12 per cent for 8½ million Australians. We have increased the concessional cap so people over 60 and over 50 can pay more money into their super to support them in retirement - half a million winners in that policy. We have abolished the age limits so people of any age can get superannuation. There are 50,000 of these people working who this year will get more superannuation. And I think, very significantly, Member for Reid, we have abolished the 15 per cent tax paid by 3½ million people who earn less than $37,000. I think by any reasonable measure these changes are not detrimental; they are positive. They are not adverse consequences; they are positive consequences.                 But I am asked by the member for Reid what are the alternative policies and what are the other ideas around. I think when evaluating policies I might do what I do not often do. I will borrow from the filter used by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition on occasions says things which attract attention. At the National Press Club he said on 31 January this year, 'There will be no unexpected changes that are detrimental to people with superannuation.' Not content with saying it once, he crowed again, on 28 March: 'There will be no unexpected adverse changes.' And on 6 April he repeated this promise. So you can imagine my surprise and disappointment when, in the reply to the budget, none other than the Leader of the Opposition said, 'Well, in fact, we will confirm our big new tax on 3½ million Australians. We, the coalition - the worst friend that the low paid have ever had in Australia - we will make every person who earns less than $37,000 pay not five per cent more tax and not 10 per cent more tax.' This mob opposite, if elected, want every poor worker, every poor employee and every part-time employee in Australia to pay 15 per cent. That is even bigger than the GST they have got in their back pocket.                 And it gets worse than that. Those opposite want to freeze the increase in superannuation from 9¼ to 10 per cent. Under the opposition that will cost a 30-year-old earning average weekly full-time wages, man or woman, $20,000. So, Member for Reid, what I can tell you to say, when you are talking to your constituents about superannuation, is that we in government are increasing superannuation, we are increasing concessional caps, we have got rid of the discrimination, we are looking after the low paid. But be very careful of those opposite, Member for Reid, if they freeze the increase to super - because they do not like compulsory superannuation. There is no doubt in my mind that apart from the big new tax they will freeze super forever.

  Thank you very much, Speaker. There is no mystery why the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is asking this question today. I have been asked questions about this kind of matter all week by the Leader of the Opposition, only to have it revealed that he has not been briefed by ASIO once during the term of this parliament. So I am not at all surprised that when it comes to matters involving ASIO the opposition approaches these matters with so little knowledge and so little understanding, because the Leader of the Opposition has shown so little care to become informed.                     Thank you very much, and to the deputy leader's question: if the Leader of the Opposition is interested in these matters, then some time he may seek to avail himself of a briefing from ASIO. ASIO is obviously a very important enforcement agency for our national security and if the Leader of the Opposition ever has the slightest thought about national security he may want to allocate the time for a briefing. On the question of security assessments undertaken by ASIO -                      On the question of security assessments by ASIO, the government is satisfied by present arrangements.

  I thank the member for McEwen very much for that question. He represents an electorate with a very large number of growing families, and he represents them very well. I think he would know that this Australian government has been delivering paid parental leave to many people in his electorate, and, of course, to 280,000 families right across this country.                 He would also know - and this would be benefitting many families in his electorate, as well - that this government has delivered the schoolkids bonus to more than one million Australian families. So families in McEwen know that this side of the House will deliver for them. We will be there to support them. They also know that they cannot trust those opposite. They cannot trust what they say.                  Yesterday in the parliament we saw both the Liberal Party and the Nationals supporting the government's decision to abolish the baby bonus. We appreciate their support, and we understand that they also voted to support the additional measures that we are putting in place so that families with a new-born baby get some extra help when that baby comes along. But, of course, this decision came after the Leader of the Opposition said, just a week or so ago, that he did not like this measure; and after the member for North Sydney said that they would vote against the extra support for lower- and middle-income families; and after the shadow Treasurer said, in response to another change that they supported last night, that that was just like the one-child policy in China. And the member for Menzies added to all of this, when he came to the dispatch box a few weeks ago talking about that government's changes, that the opposition would be opposing them.                  So Australian families are completely confused about what those opposite intend to do. And the same applies to this Leader of the Opposition's rolled-gold policy on paid parental need. We have had so many members opposite coming out and saying that they oppose it. The member for Gippsland knows that it is an unfair policy. Of course, the member for Mitchell has been out there saying that it does not pass the fair-go test. The member for Moore and Senator Joyce, of course, do not agree with it, either.                  More recently we saw that the member for Tangney did not agree with it. Just yesterday one of the Nationals said that he does not even think it will ever happen. Senator Williams said yesterday, 'We will just see, in three years time, what happens.'

  I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. He does raise a very serious issue. Certainly, I take the issue of asbestos exposure very seriously, as does the government. The health and safety of the community and workers is always paramount, and we know what a dangerous material asbestos can be.                  The government expects Telstra and their contractors to follow Australia's strict laws in the handling and removal of asbestos when it comes to preparing their pits and ducts for the rollout of the NBN. These pits and ducts are owned by Telstra, and it is their responsibility to get them ready for the NBN rollout in a safe and secure way. I acknowledge Telstra's acceptance of their responsibility and the additional actions they have announced today. Telstra chief operations officer Brendon Riley has said today, 'This is our responsibility. We will take direct control of all asbestos related activity performed by our contractors.' Telstra previously ordered an immediate halt to all new remediation works until a comprehensive national audit of these processes is completed.                 Telstra will now employ up to 200 extra field inspection workers to ensure all asbestos related remediation activity is supervised by an accredited person. The temporary stop-work on pit remediation will stay in place for contractors until they have completed further training on the safe handling and disposal of asbestos. Following all of this, Telstra will work with Comcare and an accredited training partner to review and update the mandatory training program that all Telstra contractors will need to implement before they are approved to work.                 Telstra is also going to implement stronger community engagement guidelines to give the community more information. Now, of course we take all of this very seriously. Comcare inspectors are investigating the work health and safety systems of Telstra and its contractors. The Office of Asbestos Safety has been directed to coordinate a national response and work with Telstra and with the contractors on best practice. That is a lot of detail but I do want to emphasise to the House that there are no shortcuts when dealing with asbestos, and all safety procedures must be adhered to.                 As this is all happening, NBN Co. will be working to maximise the rollout. Clearly, given this very serious issue of asbestos in Telstra pits and ducts, working with those pits and ducts will cause some delay as this audit work is done. But NBN rollout will continue in other places.

  I thank the member for Fowler. He is very well aware of the importance of investment in health, particularly in health and medical research. We were out there just last year with the Prime Minister opening the new Ingham research institute in the member's electorate - a substantial investment from the Commonwealth but also a substantial investment from the Ingham family and others. We will continue to invest as a government in health and medical research because it pays off. You only need to look at the fine results we have had with our Gardasil vaccination program for girls and now boys, and the miracle of sound being brought to millions of children around the world with Cochlear implants.                  We are also looking at how we can better embed health and medical research right across our health sector as recommended by the McKeon review. We will continue to invest but also change the way we do research. In this last budget we have invested in better support for clinical trials, and our funding for the Health and Medical Research Council continues to increase, from $771 million next year to $815 million in 2016-17 - continued investment.                 I am asked about obstacles and, I guess, the only obstacle is the opposition. We have heard from the opposition that they will quarantine health and medical research funding from budget cuts - flat-lining, quarantining, not cutting. Should we be really grateful that they are not taking the axe to it? Flat-lining would cost health and medical research -                      We are increasing health and medical research funding. Flat-lining would cost the health and medical research community $88 million between now and 2016-17. Flat-lining is a cost because it means health and medical research funding does not keep up with growing expenses.                  The other thing that this comment that they are quarantining health and medical research tells us is that everything else is on the chopping block. Are they going to quarantine funding for hospitals? Are they going to quarantine funding for medicines? Are they going to quarantine funding for health workforce training? Are they going to quarantine funding for bush services? No, none of these things are quarantined. I can tell you why. As health minister, the Leader of the Opposition cut health funding. He has been out there supporting Campbell Newman and the Victorian government and others when they cut health funding. He said that he will cut $1.2 billion from Medicare Locals, from primary health care - more recently that has been a little unpopular, so now he is hiding behind a review.                  Now we have the member for Tangney talking about austerity. Austerity in health care means cutting funding. We have seen them backflip on private health insurance and I welcome that because that goes towards dental and towards disability care. From one day to the next, you cannot tell where the opposition are on health funding. They are tricky -

  To the deputy leader, let us be very clear about what happens with security checks and why I use the terminology 'satisfactory'. First and foremost, all asylum seekers are subject to the following security checks -                      Well, no amount of screaming will change the facts and I am going to advise the parliament of the facts. All asylum seekers are subject to the following security checks, which are assessed against comprehensive intelligence holdings that compile information from the AFP, ASIO, Customs and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. This happens upon arrival, when being considered for community detention or release on a bridging visa E, when having been found to meet the definition of a refugee and when applying for a subsequent visa or citizenship. These are rigorous checks designed to identify visa applicants or visa holders whose entry into or continued stay in Australia may present a risk to national security.                 During the course of this week in question time there has been some discussion of the recent review of the administration and expenditure of Australia's intelligence agencies tabled on Monday by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. Indeed, I think the Leader of the Opposition himself was talking up the significance and rigour of that report. I would remind the House that when it came to visa security, the joint committee that the Leader of the Opposition spoke so glowingly about found that 'it was satisfied that the current regime for visa security assessments is the correct one'.

  I thank the member for Bass for his question. I had the pleasure of joining the member for Bass in his electorate in Launceston last week. It was a good opportunity to talk to some locals there about how our budget sets out a plan for Australia's future. With our government focusing in on jobs and growth, families have a lot to look forward to. They can look forward to a stronger economy with more investment in infrastructure. They can look forward to a fairer society with a fully funded National Disability Insurance Scheme. And of course they can look forward to a smarter country where we make the necessary investments to give every child the opportunity to get the education they deserve.                 I take the opportunity to welcome the fact that the ACT today has signed up to a plan that will ensure that their schools will be funded so that they can become world class. I know that that has been welcomed by families all around the ACT today. That is what families have to look forward to under our government. But, of course, families would face a very different future if the Leader of the Opposition were to get elected. Don't believe me - listen to the member for Tangney. The member for Tangney is out there today and he spilt the beans. He said, 'If elected, an Abbott government would need to put in place austerity measures.' These are the sorts of failed policies that have driven economies in Europe into recession and they have driven millions of people onto unemployment queues. And that is the recipe of those opposite for Australia's future.                 They have already given us a little bit of an indication of the hit list of policies that they have on their agenda that will slug families. They have told us about their $20 billion paid parental leave tax, which will drive up the cost of living for all Australians. They have told us about their cuts to retirement savings, how they will abandon the increase in the compulsory superannuation contributions. They have told us how they will jack up taxes on the lowest-paid workers when it comes to super. And they have also told us about how they will cut the Schoolkids Bonus.                  But make no mistake about it, they will not stop there. We know that because they have already announced their secret commission of cuts. It will be a commission of cuts that will give them more and more ideas when it comes to how they can slug families with higher taxes and deeper cuts. First, we had the member for North Sydney out there saying, 'We have got to end this age of entitlement.' Then, we had the Leader of the Opposition out there saying, with his confected outrage, that this is an age of emergency.                 We all know what we will get if they are elected - it will be an age of austerity, with cuts, cuts and more cuts. Labor stands for jobs and growth. The only thing you will get out of the Liberals is cuts to the bone.

  I thank the shadow minister for his question. This is the shadow minister who said that the Gonski report was 'Conski'. Then the shadow minister said that it was a road map. He dismissed it within 20 minutes of it being released and ever since then he has done everything in his power to sabotage our National Plan for School Improvement which will see additional investment going to every school in this country, including in the member's electorate.                 I make this point to the member opposite: whilst he goes around trying to sabotage our National Plan for School Improvement the interests of students in both his electorate and in every electorate in this country are at risk. The reason for this is straightforward: we have made it perfectly clear -                      To the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister, the indexation commitments that are included in our National Plan for School Improvement mean that this school, as well as every other school in the country, including non-government schools, will see additional investments flow from 2014. I am hopeful that upon conclusion of our negotiations with the non-government school sector that same question will be asked of me in the parliament. But for the moment we should be under no illusions as to what lies behind this question because as we conclude these negotiations -                      We should be under no illusions, nor should anyone listening be under any illusions, as to what is at stake. The question really is whether or not we will have a National Plan for School Improvement which will provide that additional investment to the school the member refers to, and every other school, or whether we have from the member opposite, who put the question to me, and the Leader of the Opposition 'A Non-Plan for School Improvement' which would see us continuing with a broken funding model and less investment going to schools around this country.                 We are at a very interesting point in the future of the National Plan for School Improvement. The Premier of New South Wales recognises how important it is and he has chosen to sign up. The Chief Minister of the ACT recognised how important it is and she has chosen to sign up. I look forward to premiers from other states recognising how important it is and signing up and for the school in question and every other school to have the certainty of additional investment over time - over the period of six years - with the National Plan for School Improvement which is supported by additional investment for every school to lift the performance -                  That the minister be granted a three-minute extension in order to allow him the time to answer Mary MacKillop College's very specific question.                 Question agreed to.                     Thank you, Speaker. I have to say at the outset that we have enjoyed good cooperative relationship with all elements of the education sector. As we resolve the final details in our negotiations with them, and then have the opportunity to make them public, of course we will do so. In fact, we believe in transparency here. If I look at what we have done with schools and investment in this nation, I can say that under this Labor government we have never in the Commonwealth had a period where there has been more investment or more substantial policy reform in education. Do not stand up here and play tricky questions at the end of this week when you are faced with the possibility that your policy will see less investment going to students in both your electorate and electorates around the country.                 In case you have not remembered, this is the government that has been responsible for nearly doubling the investment in education over four years, the government that has improved every school facility in our nation with Building the Education Revolution, the government that has introduced for the first time a national curriculum, one that the shadow minister opposite now wants to rewrite according to his view of history. This is a government that totally understands that supplying additional resources to lift the skills and capacities of all young Australians is the charge that lies at the heart of our mission and our agenda. And we will deliver.                  Leave granted.

  I thank the member for his question. Parliament established the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to invest in renewable and clean energy. This is investment which will allow Australia to tackle climate change and improve our economic competitiveness. We know that there has been a 30 per cent increase in renewable energy usage since we had a price on carbon. Parliament established the CEFC as an independent statutory authority. We legislated for it to make investments from 1 July 2013. Parliament appropriated the funds and told the corporation to get on with the job. Yet now we have the opposition leader standing over the corporation, asking it to breach its statutory obligations. That is without precedent in our parliamentary democracy. They are trying to bully an independent statutory authority into ignoring the will of the parliament and the law, besmirching the reputation of some of the most significant business people in Australia.                  This is what the CEO had to say today about some of the claims.                  There is no basis to claims that the CEFC is providing 'low-cost high risk loans' that 'no other financial institution would provide' or that we are a 'lender of last resort.'                  The CEO has been very clear about the position of this corporation. In saying that they will repudiate contracts they are going to the heart of sovereign risk. This is the epitome of sovereign risk - legal obligations entered into under legislation carried by this parliament - and those opposite say that they should just ignore it. It is seriously undermining confidence in investment in this country. The Leader of the Opposition and those opposite are putting themselves above the law, above the parliament and above the voters. They want to slash investment in renewables and clean energy just like they are intending to thug the Premier of New South Wales and say they will withdraw the agreement between the New South Wales government and the Australian government to put more funding into schools.                     I withdraw. The comments of the New South Wales Premier and education minister are all there on the record, putting the interests of schoolkids in New South Wales now and into the future above the partisan, narrow, political objectives of those opposite. The Leader of the Opposition wants to start cuts before the election, start future cuts, talking about repudiating agreements. He is not up to the job of leading this country.

  The Leader of the Opposition: I am a little bit surprised that he would choose to play politics with this because, as he well knows, this is a matter involving pits and ducts and those pits and ducts are the responsibility of Telstra. The Leader of the Opposition well knows that, but has chosen to play politics with this important matter nevertheless. I suppose we really should not be surprised, given that this is the same person who insulted Bernie Banton on his deathbed. We should not be surprised at all.                     Certainly playing politics with this matter is disgraceful. As I said last week in this parliament, if the Leader of the Opposition had chosen to listen, the health and safety of the community and workers is always paramount. We all know what a dangerous material asbestos is. We know that from the legacy of Wittenoom and the like. We as a government therefore take this matter very, very seriously. We expect Telstra and its contractors to follow the very strict laws we have in this country, and have for good reason, in relation to the handling and removal of asbestos.                 As I said initially in answer to this question, we are talking about infrastructure pits and ducts owned by Telstra. It is its responsibility to get them ready for the NBN rollout in a safe and secure way. So concerned have we been about this matter that ministers Shorten and Conroy have invited Telstra and NBN Co. executives, Comcare, the Office of Asbestos Safety, unions and asbestos safety and victims groups to meet in Canberra today to agree on the next steps required in response to this matter. At the meeting, the government has been seeking from Telstra details of its safety and removal program, and specifically a commitment to remove asbestos from the high-risk pits.                  Already the government regulator, Comcare, has stopped work and ordered asbestos removed from two sites in New South Wales. The government is also looking to establish a national register to keep a record of people, be they workers or members of the general public, who think that they have been exposed to asbestos.                 The government is very conscious of how serious a matter this is. Consequently, the two ministers have been meeting with Telstra and others today to emphasise the government's desire that Telstra get on with the job.

  I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. It was a very great pleasure to join him today, as well as the member for Corio and the Minister for Disability Reform, Minister Macklin, to make a very important announcement for the community of Geelong. In this parliament we know that Geelong has been doing it tough. We know that it has been doing it tough after the announcement of the loss of jobs from Ford. Of course, those job losses are not only in Geelong, they are also in Broadmeadows, and they are of great concern to the government because our focus is always on jobs and growth. I had the opportunity to meet with Ford workers in Geelong on the weekend and to speak to them about some additional assistance we will make available for Ford workers in Geelong and Ford workers in Broadmeadows to assist with their retraining so that they can get the next opportunity.                 But we also want to make sure that in Geelong and in Broadmeadows we are seeing new sources of opportunity, which is just one of the reasons that I was so delighted to announce today that the national headquarters of DisabilityCare Australia will be in Geelong. This national headquarters will employ 300 people. Geelong is the right place for this national headquarters - the right place because it is home to the Transport Accident Commission; it is a community with expertise in the management of disability, and DisabilityCare Australia will have a great home in Geelong. It is the right place because the Victorian government - and I congratulate the Premier - has stepped forward to see Geelong become home to the headquarters of DisabilityCare Australia with an allocation of $25 million of support. It is the right place because, of course, it is a community waiting to hear good news, and this is good news for Geelong. And it is certainly the right place because the members for Corangamite and Corio have been waging a very fierce campaign to put the credentials of Geelong before the federal government.                 Today I am in a position to say we have listened and we have decided that the national headquarters of DisabilityCare Australia will be in Geelong. The launch office for the launch site is already there in Geelong, employing some 120 people. We are less than a month away now from the launch of DisabilityCare in Geelong and in other parts of the country. I was absolutely delighted to be there today to deliver such good news for the people of Geelong.

  I thank the member opposite for the question. I wrote to Telstra in 2009 to talk to them and to say that there were people reporting that there were problems with pits. Telstra wrote back and said they had the matter under control. We have seen in recent days and weeks that clearly they have not. I can report that I have been meeting with Telstra and other stakeholders today and, in fact, I went to Penrith on Saturday with the member for Lindsay, David Bradbury, who has been standing up for these residents.                     I should say also at the outset of this issue that the identification and eradication of asbestos in Australia is a priority for this government. I am pleased that the House of Representatives on a bipartisan basis passed the legislation less than an hour ago.                 In terms of Telstra we have met with the CEO, David Thodey, and other people from his company, stakeholders including unions, including contractors, including the Chief Medical Officer and we went through the issues which have been widely reported in recent days. Telstra made it very clear at this meeting that they accepted that they have to do more. Telstra accepted, in matters going from inspection to training to education, that there had been deficiencies and that they needed to do more.                 I am pleased to inform the House that Telstra, along with all the stakeholders, including victim support groups - I do not think I had mentioned they were there - agreed about the outcomes of this meeting we have just had. What was good was that we saw organisations taking the high road in terms of not seeking to blame but, rather, to accept responsibility. We saw that Telstra accepted responsibility for end-to-end training throughout the system, making sure that contractors and everyone working with pits and ducts were trained adequately in the safe handling of asbestos. Telstra also accepted the need to do much better in terms of respecting the anxieties of the community, particularly those in Penrith and Ballarat - the member for Ballarat was also with us at the meeting - but not just them. I congratulate the CEO of Telstra on the way he conducted himself in the meeting. Indeed, in the discussions that we had there was a recognition that Telstra and stakeholders - in particular, contractors - needed to do better than they have been doing, because asbestos is a real scourge in the Australian community.                 It is estimated that one in three houses built between the end of World War II and the late 1980s would have asbestos within them. Asbestos was widely used in Australia and we have the highest per capita incidence of asbestos related diseases. It is a problem which the labour movement has been tackling for generations. It is a problem that the labour movement wishes we could uninvent.

  I thank the member for Moreton for this question, because a world-class school system is one of the pillars that modern families rely on to prosper in a globally competitive economy.                 The most fundamental thing we can do for our country, both economically and socially, is to invest in the education of our young people. We know this; it went to the very core of our recent budget. What we did was to put in place funding to invest in the Gonski school reforms - the school improvement program - knowing that this is the most fundamental investment we can make.                 There is a lot of discussion out there about competitiveness and about productivity, but all the evidence shows that if you lift the quality of your education system you can lift your productivity in your economy. So this is the smartest thing we can do for families and it is the smartest thing we can do for our country.                 Some people just see spending on education as a cost to the budget. But spending on education is a vital investment in our future. Of course, that is what the Gonski report showed, and that is what all of the research shows. It does not matter whether you go to the research from the Treasury, from private think tanks, from overseas, from the OECD or from the World Bank: it all says the same thing. And, of course, if you have a broken funding model, that impacts upon quality. What the Gonski report said is that our model is broken. So what we have to do is to put in place an up-to-date funding model that will deliver the resources and that will deliver the quality outcome for our country.                 If we look at some of the studies that have been done, there is the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, which has said that our current declining education performance will reduce the size of our economy by $1.5 trillion over the life of a child today. All of the work shows that if you increase retention rates through to year 12, that will increase GDP and add wealth to the economy.                 So, from our point of view, a stronger Australia has to come through being a smarter Australia. We also understand that this needs to be done working in cooperation with state governments. That is why the Prime Minister was so delighted to see the Premier of New South Wales sign up to a modern funding model; a funding model that delivers to every child at every school at every postcode, right across the state of New South Wales. What we want to see for Australia is to deliver that to every state: to every child across every postcode in every state of Australia - that is what we need to see if we are going to meet that challenge of the future to invest in our people.                 We saw that the education minister in New South Wales made the point that this was a funding model that was too good to refuse. But, unfortunately, we do not have sign-on - particularly from my home state of Queensland, where the Premier of Queensland has been thugged by the Leader of the Opposition in putting his political -

  I do thank the member for Moreton, because there are 45 schools in the electorate of Moreton with 21,000 students, and because the Leader of the Opposition has thugged the Premier of Queensland, they are now going to miss out -                      I do withdraw. But, of course, as we know, there are students right across the state of Queensland. We have the electorate of Brisbane, where there are something like 47 schools, and 25,000 students will miss out.                     And there we have up in Dawson tens of thousands of students who are going to miss out. The fact is that we need a world-class funding system -                      to make sure that every child across our country gets the best possible start in life.                 And, of course, politics has intervened. The Leader of the Opposition is saying to state premiers, 'Don't sign up!' just like he is saying to the Queensland government, 'Don't sign up to the Cross River Rail,' because he thinks it is in his political interests. And the losers here are the families right across Australia -                      who will not see this sort of funding increase that they deserve to see.                 In Queensland there is the loss of billions of dollars each year, and per school. If you go to a school in the electorates of Brisbane or Moreton, that is something like $2.5 million each over the next six years. That is the loss to education in Queensland: a huge loss right across the country, and all because the Leader of the Opposition puts his political interests over the interests of Australian schoolchildren.

  In terms of the issues which the shadow minister is raising, I will go to a number of the points which are inherent in the question. The first point is that what has triggered this debate is the debate about what has been happening in Penrith. I had the opportunity to go and meet the residents -                      Well, we all know why the issue is being raised. It is because there has been a whole lot of debate in the media -                      I will refer to the question in terms of my answer. The issue which has prompted the member for Wentworth's question, of course, has been the most recent reports about asbestos exposure in Penrith and, indeed, the role of Telstra and contractors, and responsibility for that exposure.                 The first point I want to make in coming to the answer of the member's question is this: asbestos should not be a political football. I met with a family whose 11-week-old child may have been exposed to asbestos. This is a very serious matter. This is why I do not believe it is appropriate that we use exposure to asbestos in a political way, which the member for Wentworth is doing. What is it about asbestos exposure which the opposition do not get? It is not politics; it actually should be above politics.                 The second point I wish to make is that the meeting we had just before has agreed - stakeholders, including Telstra and contractors, have agreed - that there should be, for the first time ever, a national public health register for exposure. That is a very important breakthrough. And it does not just extend to employees or contractors. Under this Labor government, which has got a track record of tackling asbestos, what we will do is establish a public health register. Those opposite had 12 years to do it when they were in power, and they just did not do it.                     I know the coalition has moved to the far right, but it is disappointing to see the member for Wentworth having to demonstrate his right-wing bona fides by engaging in this cheap politics.                     But for the purposes of assisting the House I would like to table the letter that I wrote to Telstra on 27 March 2009.

  I thank the member for the question. I note that it is the labour movement who have got, I think, the proudest record of tackling the issues on asbestos. We understand that asbestos in Australia will still kill -                      Member for Dawson, what is it about asbestos that you think there is a need for you to pollute with your political palaver? Asbestos is an absolute priority to tackle and eradicate in this country. It is a Labor government which has now created, for the first time, a national agency to deal with asbestos and coordinate a national plan. Asbestos is something which for generations the labour movement and - I am going to use those words that the opposition hate hearing; they put their hands over their ears - the trade unions pushed hard on. Everyone in the labour movement wishes, as I know many in the opposition do, that we could uninvent the scourge of asbestos. We wish that companies like James Hardie had done it differently from the way they did, but they did not and that is the sad legacy of asbestos.                 We know in this country that it is not just those who have mined asbestos and it is not just those who have worked in the manufacturing of asbestos but now it is people in their own homes and in the communities who can be exposed to asbestos. That is why this government commissioned an asbestos management review, chaired by Geoff Fary, to make recommendations on how we can have a national approach on asbestos. In implementing the recommendations of that report, we have created legislation to create an asbestos agency. I acknowledge that the opposition have supported that asbestos agency. I particularly acknowledge the member for Farrer and a speech she gave about supporting this matter.                  Today I have had to meet Telstra, along with my ministerial colleagues the member for Ballarat, the member for Lindsay and the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy. We met with Telstra, we met with NBN Co., we met with stakeholders, we met with trade unions and we met with the victims groups - we had the Chief Medical Officer present - to talk about what we do, because it is clear to me, having spoken directly with the member for Lindsay and to the residents in Penrith, that they have not been treated properly in the way that this matter has been conducted. But what is particularly pleasing is that the CEO of Telstra, David Thodey, came to the meeting and he took a leadership position. He did not take a political position and he did not take a legal position. He took a leadership position. He agreed that Telstra accepts responsibility that it has to do more. So residents should be pleased that that is the open transparency which Telstra is committed to. He put the contractors on notice that he expects people to live up to the standards and to make sure that Telstra's standards are trained throughout the system. Furthermore, he said that he accepted responsibility for the end-to-end training involved.                 This has been a dreadful time for those Penrith residents. It is a dreadful time to think that your child might have been exposed. It will hardly be enhanced by some of the opposition questioning, I have to say. But what we will do, I can inform the House, is establish a national asbestos register for anyone to record their possible exposure to asbestos - not just employees and contractors but residents, people in their own homes and people in our communities. We will work with all stakeholders and we will work with the opposition when they choose to work with us, and we will not see the people of Penrith and other areas let down in the way they were by Telstra and other organisations who should have done better.

  In March 2009 - and I am sorry the member for Wentworth has not followed my career as closely as he ought to have - I was the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services. So, of course, as parliamentary secretary for disabilities I still wrote to Telstra, because people had come to me and said there were concerns and, as a conscientious member of parliament, you still raise issues. But, if the member for Wentworth is saying that as parliamentary secretary for disabilities somehow I am not doing my job there, let us have a look at the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which the leader opposite is so keen to hug.                 When we talk about asbestos, since I have become the minister we have implemented the Asbestos Management Review and we have put in place a national agency. When the matters in Penrith came to light, I went up on the weekend to go and see the residents and to hear from them. I would be interested to see how the member for Wentworth went with the residents of Penrith when he met with them, if he has actually done that, seeing that he is very keen to give advice. But, furthermore, I convened a meeting with Telstra. I am having a look at my correspondence, Member for Wentworth, on all the occasions on which you have raised with me the issues of asbestos and Telstra. What I might suggest here is that what really matters is the safety of Australians. What really matters is dealing with exposure to asbestos. What really matters is not taking some sort of petty political right-wing points -

  I appreciate the member for Wentworth continuing the politicisation of asbestos. But, in terms of following up on the matters, following 27 March I did actually write to Telstra again, on 4 August 2009. I am happy to table that. Then on 2 November I wrote again to Telstra about their issues. At that point Telstra again wrote back to me with a detailed proposition about what they are doing. So, in fact, I am happy to see how many communications -                      My goodness! This is more relevant than your questions. I am happy to understand from the shadow minister for communications how he has not raised any issues if he is meant to be across the issues of Telstra. I am interested to see -                      I tell you what: whilst I may have got in a traffic jam going out to Penrith on Saturday, it was not caused by a whole long list of federal Liberal MPs rushing out to see asbestos exposure victims. Very tawdry!

  I thank the member for Capricornia for that question, and I know that she has had a profound commitment to the delivery of support for education in her electorate: nearly $130 million in improving school facilities, 60 libraries, 26 multipurpose halls and 63 classrooms. The member would be familiar with the results for Queensland students, where more effort and more support are needed. I had a look at the NAPLAN results for 2012, and we can see that in year 3 reading around 17.4 per cent of students in Queensland are at or below national minimum standard. That is around 10,000 students. In international testing in year 4 reading, almost one in three students in Queensland are at or below benchmarks. The key thing here - and the Treasurer referred to it - is that, if kids are below these benchmarks, they will not get good jobs in the future and their learning will not proceed as well as it could.                 Of course, our response to that is to make sure that we invest in reforms that will make a difference: individual help for students, lifting teacher quality and giving principals more say over their school. If Premier Newman would put the petty politics aside then schools in Queensland would benefit from additional investment of around $3.8 billion over the next six years. I am asked why the plan is so important. The reason why this plan is so important is that the opposite to that is that if Queensland does not sign up then over the next six years Queensland government schools will lose a total of around $3 billion and non-government schools a total of around $1.2 billion. Incidentally, that is about $2.5 million on average per school.                 I notice that others outside the parliament can see how critical and important this is. I saw the release from the Australian Government Primary Principals Association. I applaud the primary principals for speaking up, because they have been very clear that Australian students deserve to have their governments act on their behalf. That is what they specifically said, but they had something to say about the opposition as well, and it was this: they rejected the views expressed by Tony Abbott and Christopher Pyne that the current school-funding model is satisfactory and any changes should be postponed to a distant future.                 That is 5,300 school leaders in government primary schools around Australia declaring absolutely clearly that what the opposition leader and the member for Sturt have on the table in rejecting this National Plan for School Improvement will mean less investment going to schools in Queensland, not more. At the end of the day, if we want a stronger, smarter and fairer nation, we need to support a National Plan for School Improvement. That is what we will do. The opposition will not.

  I appreciate the member for Cowper promoting me to Minister for Communications. I will take some of that question on notice to find out the answers to the matters to do with NBN Co., which is not in my portfolio. But what I can say in answer to the question about asbestos and training is that I have represented the debate about asbestos, the victims of asbestos and people being exposed to asbestos while I was with the union. I have done this alongside many of the other representatives of the union movement throughout the history of dealing with asbestos.                 I have certainly also represented issues about people being exposed to asbestos while I have been in the parliament. I have also represented them upon becoming minister for workplace relations and in making sure that we get the recommendations to the asbestos management review and also upon implementing the recommendations. I also believe I was representing them when I was there on Saturday with the member for Lindsay, Mr Bradbury, the Assistant Treasurer. I believe that I was representing people today, along with the member for Ballarat, the member for Lindsay and the communications minister, by making sure that -                      I thank the member for Cowper. I tell you one thing I have never done: I have never represented the companies in court who made the asbestos and damaged workers.                      I will tell you what I have also done: I have never insulted the victims of asbestos and their campaigners.

  I thank the member for Wakefield for his question because the government is working with Australian manufacturers to support jobs and to improve competitiveness and to improve productivity. Just last February the Prime Minister and I released a $1 billion plan to support manufacturing jobs in particular. We have also got our $5.4 billion new car plan which is assisting the automotive industry. That is $5.4 billion in assistance that the coalition would take an axe to, just like they voted against our $300 million Steel Transformation Plan to support jobs in the steel industry - they would take an axe to that as well - and just like last week the coalition voted against the government's Australian Jobs Bill to give local manufacturers fairer opportunities on major resource projects. We stand for jobs on this side of the House, they stand to axe them.                 It is important to rely upon accurate information when considering the challenges facing industries like manufacturing, otherwise policy responses will not have a proper foundation. If you took the approach of the opposition leader to policy development, you would be in all sorts of trouble because he blames everything on carbon pricing. It is responsible for every problem in the country. Over the weekend he once again blamed carbon pricing for Ford's decision to cease manufacturing in 2016 and he once again wrongly and falsely claimed that carbon pricing added $400 to the cost of a car. That is a totally false and mendacious claim that has been disproven on numerous occasions. It relies upon speculation from early in 2011 before the government even announced the carbon price policy. It assumes a carbon price significantly higher than the actual price that is in the market. It assumes there is no assistance to industries like steel and glass, that there is no assistance to industries, and all of his assumptions - of course - are wrong. The opposition leader knows it.                  The fact is that the carbon price impact on car manufacturers is about $50 a car, not $400 a car as he falsely claimed. If you compare it to the appreciation in the Australian dollar of just 1c, 1c appreciation equates to about a $250 impact on the competitiveness of an Australian car. So every time the opposition leader repeats this $400 figure he is deliberately misleading the Australian public and the auto manufacturing workforce. That deception was called out on the weekend by none other than the star of today's question time, the member for Wentworth. He had this to say about this claim, 'It would be disingenuous to suggest that the reason Ford is shutting down is because of the carbon tax'. He is on the move. He has been sitting up here at the table and he is absolutely right on that.

  To the Leader of the Opposition's question and quick change of topic: what the government has done and is continuing to do is implement the expert recommendations from the panel overseen by Angus Houston and participated in by Paris Aristotle and Michael L'Estrange. The government is continuing to pursue those recommendations.                 Of course, the Leader of the Opposition walked into this parliament and voted for more boats. At the same time, and in accordance with the recommendations of that expert panel, we are working with our neighbours on cooperation against people smuggling. We do work very strongly, for example, with Indonesia on cooperation against people smuggling. What we do not do as we cooperate with Indonesia is verbal them, pretend that an agreement has been reached with them and only then, in an embarrassing move, back away from it - that is, we do not conduct ourselves like the opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.                     I am being directly relevant to the question of protecting our borders, directly relevant to the question of regional cooperation and, consequently, directly relevant to how one has to deal with our neighbours with respect to ensure that one can maximise cooperation. What you do not do if you are treating our neighbours with respect is give an interview claiming that you have got a deal with them only, when it gets a bit hot and people go inquiring about that deal, to then, in a shambolic way, back away from it. But that, of course, is exactly the position the opposition has found itself in today. It is in that position because, in this very important area of people smuggling, what it is continuing to do is try and peddle a slogan.                     They are continuing to try and pretend that they have got some solutions. The Leader of the Opposition well knows that, when he had an opportunity to meet with the President of Indonesia, he did not even raise his so-called 'policy' of turning back boats, because he knew he would be repudiated.                     Now today the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has embarrassed herself, embarrassed the opposition and embarrassed the nation.

  I certainly thank the member for Reid not only for his question but also for his interest in Asian century policy. Through the AsiaBound program the government are supporting young people studying in Asia. We are providing financial support for around 3,600 students a year from Australia to go study in Asia. There is legislation being debated to bring that to fruition from 1 July. In addition, through the Asian century scholarships we are supporting young people from the region coming to study in Australia. Indeed, the Asian century scholarship program supports 12,000 students from the region and therefore dwarfs the Colombo Plan. Everyone knows of the Colombo Plan, but this is so much bigger. In fact, the Asian century scholarships do in five years what the Colombo did in 30 years.                 I am asked about obstacles to building those relationships with our neighbours in the region. Of course, there are very substantial obstacles, and they are sitting over on the other side of the parliament. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has embarrassed not only the coalition but also the Leader of the Opposition, the Australian parliament and the Indonesian government by falsely claiming that high-ranking Indonesian ministers and officials have indicated privately that Indonesia would cooperate with a coalition government to turn back people smuggler boats. The report says the Deputy Leader of the Opposition insisted on that. Indeed, to quote her, she said:                 I have had a number of conversations with high-ranking Indonesian ministers and officials, as has Scott Morrison as has Tony Abbott and I am convinced we can work in cooperation with Indonesia to achieve our policy aim -                  of towing back boats. She was challenged about that by the Indonesian ambassador, who completely repudiated any such suggestion. When he said, 'No such collaboration will happen between Indonesia and Australia to bring back the people to Indonesia,' the Deputy Leader of the Opposition told the Guardian:                 Professional diplomats are paid to present particular views but what goes on behind the scenes can be quite different _                 So she is saying that the ambassador for Indonesia has had a private conversation with her - obviously, no such conversation with her ever occurred.                     Dr EMERSON:                     Oh, really? She has just again raised this proposition that the Indonesian ambassador had said to her privately that they will agree to tow back boats. They will not. Indeed, the foreign minister, Marty Natalegawa, has said they will not and the Indonesian ambassador has said, 'We will not,' yet she persists with this false claim.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. I can assure the House and assure the honourable member that national security is the most important priority of this government. I can assure the House that our security agency, ASIO, the Australian Federal Police and the department work very closely together to ensure that our people are kept safe. For that reason we can assure this House that we will continue to ensure there is rigour when we make assessments. What people do understand is that when we have people arrive in such a fashion - that is through irregular maritime arrivals - there are assessments for security, for identity and for health purposes. That occurs so as to ensure that, if we were to release people, we would release people in an appropriate manner.                 In so far as the matter in question that has been raised by the honourable member is concerned -                      at no time has that person been out of detention in the entire period he has been in Australia.                     It would be misleading for the honourable member in asking the question to suggest that the person in question has been out of detention. He has not been out of detention. Further to that, there has also been surveillance and monitoring of that person while in detention.                 There are a number of things that I will not disclose and should not disclose because they are matters of national security. We have a convention of providing briefings that we are very happy to extend to the opposition, of course provided that, if we do allow such a briefing, they do not disclose those details publicly, which happened last week by the shadow Attorney-General after being briefed by -                      As I was saying, we have ensured that the person has been detained at all times. That was the advice I received from my department. The department continues to work with the Australian Federal Police and ASIO to ensure that our people are kept safe. It would be absolutely outrageously misleading for the honourable member to suggest otherwise.                 Further to that, we do not want to reflect on the hardworking men and women of our agencies. They do a wonderful job. This question insinuates that somehow those agencies failed us. They did not fail us. For that reason the honourable member should rethink what he wants to be putting to me in question time if he is suggesting and impugning the good name of our agencies.

  To the Leader of the Opposition's question, families will be worse off under his plan to take away the schoolkids bonus - a direct cut for families raising two children across the schooling life of their children of $15,000. That is real money, worse off, Australian families around the nation.                 On carbon pricing, the Leader of the Opposition has come into the parliament and yet again misrepresented the impact of carbon pricing. Carbon pricing is working to reduce carbon pollution. There is no doubt about that.                    The Leader of the Opposition's question referred to the government's carbon pricing policy and suggested it was not working to reduce carbon pollution. I refer the Leader of the Opposition to the question he actually asked. The question he actually asked, in answer to it: the government's policy - the carbon price and the Renewable Energy Target - are working to reduce carbon pollution. We have a policy working to reduce carbon pollution. Not one of the ridiculous, hysterical claims made by the Leader of the Opposition against carbon pricing has come true - not one of those claims.                 I note that the Leader of the Opposition was out at a steel-manufacturing facility earlier today. No doubt he refused to tell the workers there that he came into this parliament and voted against their jobs by voting against the Steel Transformation Plan.                 The intention of this government is for carbon pricing to continue because it is the least-cost way of reducing carbon pollution in our atmosphere. The Leader of the Opposition would prefer a higher cost way of reducing carbon pollution in our atmosphere. No doubt he would push those costs through to Australian families. It is estimated that that would cost families up to $1,300 a year. Then, of course, there is the Leader of the Opposition's plan to make them $15,000 worse off during the life of their children at school. The Leader of the Opposition has tried every act of hysteria when it comes to carbon pricing. Now the Australian people can judge from the facts, not from his fiction.

  I thank the member for Reid for his question. The member for Reid and others in the parliament may have read in today's newspapers the story of Canley Vale High School, which has lifted its performance through the support of our Smarter Schools National Partnerships. This is a school that has focused on teacher quality, quality learning and empowered school leadership. What that means is that new ways of working have been combined with extra money from the federal government - in the case of Canley Vale High School some three million extra dollars to ensure that children in the school get a better education. The principal is reported as saying that NAPLAN is particularly useful and it shows that the school results are above average in almost every area. The kinds of practical initiatives that have been funded through the extra resources made available by the federal government include after-school homework clubs, a double literacy period for years 7 and 8, and attendance programs - simple measures but making a powerful difference for the quality of children's education.                 I want to see that kind of change - new resources working with improved teaching to raise outcomes for children - in all 9,500 schools around the country. I want to see that for the children of Queensland. I want to see $3.8 billion flow to 1,700 Queensland schools, boosting each school on average by $2.2 million. This would be a very big change for Queensland, better for the children, lifting the learning outcomes. That is why I have written to Premier Newman and asked him to be frank about the real reasons that he is refusing to work with the federal government to increase funding for Queensland schools. Certainly we have provided the detailed modelling and updates to that modelling five times. There have been 56 meetings of officials. But, despite this, Premier Newman has not responded to our offer.                 What is the explanation for this? Presumably, the Leader of the Opposition is prevailing upon Premier Newman to put the politics first and put the kids last. My message to Premier Newman is: put the kids first and the politics last. Do what the Premier of New South Wales has been prepared to do.                 We will see a great sporting clash this week between Queensland and New South Wales. I am concerned too about the education race between those two states. I do not want to see children in Queensland left behind. Premier Newman should do the same as Premier O'Farrell has done and put his children first.

  To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: that report is entirely untrue, but given I am asked a question by the shadow minister for foreign affairs I will take this opportunity to table a report from TheGuardian that makes it absolutely clear that she has misled the Australian nation. She has misled this parliament. The opposition's policy about refugees and asylum seekers -                    The member for Mitchell then left the chamber.                   The member for Kooyong then left the chamber.                 Leave not granted.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. Like all members on this side of the chamber, he knows that education is the key to our national prosperity, that it is a pathway out of disadvantage for many young Australian students and in the Asian century it will be the platform for high-skilled, high-paid jobs in the future. I will soon table comprehensive amendments to the Australian Education Bill enshrining in the legislation the most significant reforms in education in 40 years, amendments that put in place for the first time a new fairer school funding system that will see every school funded on the basis of need, amendments that set out in detail the National Plan for School Improvement reforms, including a model based on the recommendations of the independent Gonski review.                 Importantly, this bill brings for the first time funding for government and non-government schools together in one piece of legislation, providing extra public funding for students who need it. It does not matter where they live and it does not matter what school they are going to. Crucially here we have a choice for the Australian public and people listening: a legislated plan provided for in the budget, increasing school funding every year, driving reforms to help students and locking in fairness for the long term or the opposition's plan to keep a broken funding model that would see students left behind and schools go backwards by $16.2 billion.                 There was an op-ed produced by the Leader of the Opposition on education. Previously he had said that the injustice in school funding was that public schools get too much money. We saw the 'real solutions' glossy. Education came in at priority No. 17. Today he had an opportunity to set the record clear and what did we get on education from the Leader of the Opposition? It had a whiff of the Howard era about it. There were a few typical incantations: 'when I was at school', 'choice, choice' and of course their old favourite 'a rigorous curriculum'. Well we have news for the Leader of the Opposition. In the 21st century not every parent has a choice where they send their child to school and, in case he has not noticed, we have already got a national curriculum. We have delivered it and it is being taught in schools around Australia.                 What we can take from the opposition leader's very carefully scripted piece, given the $16.2 billion of investment in schools that would be denied as a consequence of Mr Abbott's policies, is that if you are a kid in the country who does not care about the extra support you need or if you are a teacher in a tough school then get ready for the rhetoric of choice and cuts. This is a very important piece of legislation in front of the parliament - A National Plan for School Improvement - making sure that we have a better education for all Australian students in all schools.

  I thank the member for Kennedy for this very important question, because we do have a crisis in our northern cattle industry. We have an enormous amount of stress, high levels of debt and problems with valuations in parts of our rural sector right across the country, not just in North Queensland but also in the dairy industry in parts of Victoria and also in Western Australia. This is a very serious issue that the government takes seriously, which is why we did this fund late in April with a package of $420 million in concessional loans for farmers.                 What we see here are viable farms impacted upon on the one hand by a high dollar and on the other by revaluations. Of course, this has put them under an enormous amount of stress. The government has put forward in good faith a package of $420 million in concessional loans. But to effectively deliver this we do require the cooperation of the states. They have the infrastructure at the local level to deliver this. They have the apparatus to deliver it and to work on the ground. I thought we would get that. I thought we would get it quickly, given the amount of stress in parts of the rural sector. So, frankly, I have been shocked by the failure of the states to come to the party. We are asking them to take on the administrative costs, so we are putting forward this package in good faith. It is urgently needed for a whole group of farmers who are viable in the long term but are impacted very badly by levels of debt and the value of the dollar in the short term.  I have been shocked by the failure of the states to come on board, because this money should be flowing right now. I would urge all of the states to come on board, in good faith, to work with the Commonwealth in the interests of our rural producers.                 The member for Kennedy asked me whether we could consider creating some new organisation to do this if we do not get the cooperation of the states. I say that that would certainly involve too much delay. This matter is urgent. So in the first instance the federal government's preference is to work in a cooperative way with the state governments to get the finance to these rural producers who desperately need it. We will continue to do that in good faith.

  I thank the member for Capricornia for her ongoing interest in quality education for all young people. In the Asian century the fact is that four of the top five schooling systems are now in our region - that is where our competition is. If our young people are going to have the vast array of rewarding career opportunities, we need to compete successfully with the schooling systems in the Asian region. Indeed, in the Australia in the Asian century white paper we set the goal that by 2025 Australia's schooling system would be in the top five. The only way we can do that is to reform the education system and to invest heavily in it.                 In Queensland, that is not happening. In New South Wales, it is happening. Premier O'Farrell has confirmed that he has been put under enormous pressure by the Leader of the Opposition not to sign up to the agreement to which he did sign. Obviously, Mr Newman in Queensland is succumbing to that pressure because he thinks it is more important to put the interests of the Liberal Party ahead of the interests of the kids in Queensland. I say to the Premier of Queensland, 'Put the kids before the Libs.' Put the kids first. We must make sure that kids in Queensland get the same quality education as is now on offer in New South Wales. What is on offer from the Commonwealth for Queensland is $2.5 billion in extra funding. That means an average of $2.2 million per school. For those schools that are especially disadvantaged it is even more, because that is the basis of these reforms.                 But the Leader of the Opposition wants to put his career before the careers of those kids who need to compete successfully in the Asian century. So put the kids before the Libs and sign up to these reforms. Instead of improving relations with our region, which this would do by having more kids travel to and from Asia, we have had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition verbal the Indonesian government. In so doing, she has embarrassed herself, she has embarrassed the parliament and she has embarrassed Australia. She should apologise or resign.

  I can advise the honourable member that the assessment has yet to commence. But I make it very clear that every person who is considered for the granting of a permanent visa is subject to a character test. If the person fails this test, their visa can be refused. Security assessments are also, of course, a routine part of the protection visa application process, so it would be a part of any assessment of this individual. Individuals who are assessed by ASIO to be directly or indirectly a risk to national security are issued with an adverse security assessment. As a matter of policy, the government has determined that individuals with adverse security assessments should remain in detention rather than live in the community.

  I thank the member for Bass for his question, an important question about protecting the interests of workers in this country. As a government, we responded to the global financial crisis by supporting Australian workers. We repealed Work Choices to ensure we enhanced employment security. And we will reform the 457 visa to ensure we provide employment opportunities for workers in this country, particularly young people who are being trained and need a job. This is not, as some try to describe it, anti foreign worker; this is unashamedly and unapologetically pro local worker, and so it should be. The fact is this is consistent with Labor values.                 I watched the opposition leader in an interview today dismiss the abuse of 457s as 'nonexistent'. How does he explain that 15 per cent of employers surveyed by the Migration Council of Australia said that they have no trouble finding local workers but still look overseas first? What about the growth of 457s increasing 20 times faster than the total employment growth rate of this country? What about wage rates falling where there is a spike in 457 use? Indeed, what about the seven per cent of those applicants on 457s saying that they are paid less than locals? The reason, of course, that the opposition leader denies the evidence is that he has said and continues to say this temporary scheme should be the mainstay of immigration in this country. The opposition's position can also be summed up by what the member for Cook said in a speech to the Australian Mines and Metals Association on 2 August 2012:                 _ it is essential we consolidate the role of 457s and look to restore access that has been taken away for these visas_                 That was last year before these reforms. Further, he went on to say:                 At current levels _ under the 457 programme there is room for expansion.                 What a stark difference between the opposition and this government. We want to protect the interests of local workers and ensure that when we do use the 457 scheme, which is an important scheme, it is used legitimately. What it should not be used for is as a replacement for workers in this country or to displace young people who are being trained and want to fill the positions in the future. The opposition have made clear that they want to see an expanded version of the 457 scheme. They have said they want to remove, as they would put it, the 'impediments' to accessing this scheme which would grow the scheme and deny Australian workers and young people in this country proper jobs, genuine jobs, in communities throughout the country.

  I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. But I have to say, what a glass jaw this fellow has got. Yesterday, he ran an argument saying we were not doing enough and today, because he has opened the book on asbestos for the first time, he is saying, 'You shouldn't do this; you shouldn't do that.' Now we have a debate about duelling opinions on the best way to treat asbestos. What a glass jaw. Yesterday, we know what was raised about asbestos. I would love to have thought it was about the residents of Penrith.                   The member for Wentworth then left the chamber.                   The member for Aston then left the chamber.                     Little did I know when I said 'glass jaw' that he would so quickly prove my statement.                     I have been asked a question about competing methods for dealing with the threat of asbestos. I am pleased to answer that question because this government has got a proud record. This government, in fact, is a world leader.                 Nothing excuses Telstra's failure to deliver up to the promises and undertakings it has made to the community. Again, I wish to put on record that I recognise that the CEO of Telstra has shown leadership, as opposed to a small target, by indeed offering his acceptance of responsibility.                 But I have been asked about what the best way forward is in terms of dealing with asbestos. I do not resile from the view that the best way to deal with asbestos is not in the long term to leave it in the ground. But on this side we stand for the eventual eradication of asbestos. Asbestos kills people; it kills 700 people a year - it is a dreadful substance, and the people who have produced it over the years have done this in the full knowledge, in my opinion, of the risks it presented.                 But if you want to change health and safety, it does take time. There are a lot of people who need to be brought along the path of making Australia's workplaces safer. In my experience it is particularly difficult to change the health and safety direction of large corporations. It is slow and difficult; otherwise it would have happened many years ago. What you have to do is alert them - that is what this government has done - you have to identify the issues, you have to seed ideas into them and you have to put forward suggestions on what should be done. It needs to be done at the highest level. That is what this government has done.                 But, indeed, you not only need to challenge organisations - and they normally respond in my experience, as Telstra did: 'We've got it under control'. But then what has happened is that this government has initiated a review of asbestos, we have acted on the recommendations and we have set up the first agency to create a national approach. This government has done a lot, and I have to say that it is a sad day when otherwise respectable members of the opposition seek to tarnish their own reputations by turning this into a political issue.                 Asbestos should be a bipartisan issue, and even though he is not in the chamber I extend to the member for Wentworth the opportunity to work with us on how to make asbestos safe, because it does not matter how you take and challenge those pits that are there; under anyone's policy on telcos, if you open one of those pits in the wrong way you will hurt people and you will damage them, and that is what we must fight jointly.

  I thank the member for Banks for that very important question. Before I go into that in detail I just want to inform the House that the RBA, the Reserve Bank of Australia, has decided to keep interest rates on hold. What this means is that interest rates are now at record lows under this government. That is of enormous benefit to many people out there with mortgages and many people out there in small business. If you have an average mortgage of $300,000, you are paying $5,500 a year less on average than you were when Labor came to government - that is, when the others were in power. So lower interest rates are further evidence of the very strong economic management of this government.                 We have put in place a fiscal policy which has given the Reserve Bank the flexibility to lower rates over time within an environment of contained inflation. That is absolutely essential so we can grow our economy for the future. Our economy has been growing: 13 per cent larger than it was at the end of 2007, with record low interest rates, and there have been 950,000 jobs created in that time. Of course, these are precisely the circumstances in which we should be making the very big, smart investments for the future, the ones which bring with them future prosperity, that lift our productivity and that lift our economic capacity. And nothing is more important in this regard than an investment in education. That is why our recent budget was so important, not just putting jobs and growth first but also making room in the budget for investments in education which will bring the great benefit to this country in the years to come.                 That is why it is so distressing to see the Leader of the Opposition is in cahoots with the Premier of Queensland, actively coordinating an attack on extra funding which will flow to students in Queensland - extra funding which of course is going to flow to students in New South Wales. If we are going to win the economic race in the future, we have got to invest in education. That is something that the Premier of New South Wales understands, but not something the Premier of Queensland and not something the Leader of the Opposition understand. By their action, by staying with the old broken formula, they are going to deny $4.2 billion to the school students of Queensland over the next six years. What could be worse, what could be more reckless than that denial - the failure to invest in the future? It says everything about those opposite. They have not got a grasp of basic economics. They have not got a grasp of the investments we need to make for the future. They will starve the future, they will not make the necessary investments and in the process they will put their political interests before the interest of students in Queensland.

  I do believe that asbestos exposure in Australia is a big issue; let me be very clear about that. The reason why I say that is more people are going to die from asbestos exposure than died in World War I. That is why this government - and I do recognise and concede that those opposite did, in a bipartisan fashion, vote for our asbestos legislation - is the first government since Federation to actually put in place a national approach on asbestos. In terms of telecommunications -                    The member for Lyons then left the chamber -                      I thank the member for Bradfield for his question. I do believe asbestos is a big issue in Australia. It is not just an issue in telecommunications, as I was about to say; it is an issue across Australia. At least one in every three houses has asbestos in it if it was built after 1945 and before the mid-1980s. Even as we speak, and this weekend, there will be people who will do renovations in their homes who need to be alert to the issue of possible asbestos in the house. When they tamper with the shed or they take down the shed or they do the renovations or they lift up the carpet which might have some cement tiles underneath which contain asbestos, they do need to be careful. So I do believe it is an issue, and of course it is an issue within telecommunications.                 It is an issue to make sure that we remove it safely. But what we cannot do is adopt the 'see no evil, hear no evil, talk no evil' approach of the opposition about leaving it, as the Leader of the Opposition suggested, in situ, in place. It is inevitable that Australians will want to change their houses and renovate them. It is inevitable that whoever is in power will want to renovate our telecommunications system - even if your plan is too slow, too late and too old, nonetheless, if you are elected you will end up having policies which will take people into these pits. What is most important, though, if that is the case - be it the householder at home, be it the telecommunications worker at a telecommunications pit, be it anyone in our community, be it the people who wash the clothes of those who might be exposed to it, be it the kids who might be watching mum or dad renovate on the weekend - is the safe removal.                 As much as the opposition have tried to turn this asbestos debate into a debate about NBN - and let's face it, they never talk, by and large, in the parliament, although there are many notable exceptions individually about the issue - they have not really tried to make asbestos an issue of concern for the coalition. It is not really part of their brand. The only reason they are talking about it now is because they see it as a way to attack NBN. Let's call it for what it is.                 But let us at least use the opposition attack to take an opportunity to get above politics, to talk about asbestos exposure generally. Telstra has made it clear that they knew there are cement-lined pits which have asbestos in them. They have made it clear that the contractors have not fulfilled it. We know that there needs to be daily exposure. The issue is asbestosis, not politics.

  I thank the member for Corangamite for the question. There is a lot at stake today in terms of whether or not Australia continues to be the world leader on protecting the oceans and whether or not we continue a process which has been going for 20 years, and had been supported under the Howard years but has had a complete backflip under this Leader of the Opposition.                 On the weekend I saw a big article in The Australian that told me that there were going to be up to 1,000 people rallying in Torquay who were going to be very angry about this process. After The Australian article - and I will table it - there was no media coverage of it at all. Then I discovered the reason must be the funny way 1,000 people was calculated. Those numbers were in some way short - they used the shadow Treasurer to do the figures, clearly. Why would so few people turn up to the rally?                 What the shadow minister for the environment did not tell them was that when they were making their speeches from the tinny they were speaking from - they spoke in a tinny, though admittedly it was on land - they did not let people know that if you wanted to go from that rally to an area where you are not allowed to fish, you would have to go out, turn left, go across the Bass Strait and, after 460 kilometres, you would get to the first place where you could not fish, a place where the no-fishing zone was put in place in 2007 when the member for Wentworth was the minister for the environment. The nearest restriction on recreational fishing was put in place by the Howard government when they were in charge.                 This is a process where the science it has been based on was commenced under the Howard years. Some of these plans on the inside cover have the happy smiling face of the member for Wentworth and the member for Dawson for science. As for the process of consultation when they say, 'No consultation happened at all,' there were five separate rounds of consultation and three-quarters of a million submissions engaged - in a process that works. What we found for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park work which has now come back with restrictions put in place by the Howard government that they now conveniently forget, is that fish stocks do improve. Coral trout numbers are six times what they used to be. Crown of thorns starfish are at a quarter of the levels in the protected zones that they are in the rest of the park. It is a process which for 20 years had had bipartisan support, and which the opposition are hoping will come to nothing tonight.

  I thank the member for Dawson for his question. He is right, I believe, to raise this concern and I appreciate his raising it. Despite what I have said about some of the issues being raised about the politics of just trying to use asbestos to attack the NBN, I for one am not satisfied to hear what you have just said in terms of the safety of people. I will ask my Comcare regulator to give me a report.                 One thing I know is that it is possible to take and handle asbestos safely. I do not support the proposition advanced by the Leader of the Opposition that we just leave asbestos there for time immemorial - all asbestos. I believe that we do have to have a prioritised removal process. This is probably a point of difference, one I hope that it is not between the opposition and the government -                      I believe in the prioritised removal of asbestos because in some cases it will become airborne. Some of the places which have asbestos in them, such as the Telstra pits which the member for Dawson has kindly brought to my attention, could contain asbestos. These pits will get tampered with over time. There are pipes and ducts which will get tampered with - as they will in people's own residential houses.                 What we need to do - and what I am pleased that Telstra did at a meeting convened by myself and the Minister for Communications - is that we want to make sure that where asbestos has to be removed where we come into contact with asbestos it is done safely. That is why what is clear in recent weeks and months, and the member for Dawson's question to me taken at face value reinforces the importance of what this government is doing, is that we need to make sure that there is safe handling where people come into contact with it. So I will follow up your matter and I will give you a report on it, and it is not acceptable.

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question and acknowledge the important work that she did as the chair of the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Recognition. This is a proposition that has the support of both the government and the opposition as well as the minor parties in this parliament. Later today we will commence the discussion and conclude the discussion on the Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013.                 It is important to note that in terms of the support out there in local communities over 490 councils have passed resolutions in support of the government's proposal to recognise local government in the Constitution. This is absolutely vital, because the federal government does play an important role in terms of providing support for local government, including through programs such as the Roads to Recovery program, which deals with local roads, but also the 6,000 local community infrastructure projects that we have done through either the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program or the Regional Development Australia Fund. These are all absolutely vital projects that have made a difference to local communities.                 We have made sure in the way that the wording has been framed that it will not change the relationship between state governments and local governments. It talks about local government which is created by the states and therefore created by and accountable to state governments. So it does not change that balance. We have seen a few scare campaigns out there reminiscent of the old daylight saving arguments that it will change the colour of your curtains and the cows will not milk in the morning. All of them are based on similar irrational views. A rational analysis of this change suggests that it is a moderate change but it is an important change. It is important that the Constitution reflect the actual governance structures in this nation, and they are that we have three tiers of government. This has been long supported by the Labor Party. This is also supported by the Leader of the Opposition. I congratulate the Leader of the National Party and others, including the members for Hinkley, Calare, Parkes and others, who I understand spoke at the National Party conference on the weekend and rebelled on the idea that there should be opposition to this referendum.                 I think it is vital that this get as broad support as possible. It is commonsense change, it recognises modern reality as it exists here in Australia and it will ensure that there is no doubt whatsoever about whether the federal government can provide that vital funding that local government relies upon. I say to some of the state governments that they would not want to be in a position of having to step in were that knocked out in terms of the ability of the federal government to fund local government.

  I thank the member for her question. I would refer the member to the words of Telstra CEO David Thodey, who said: 'We own the infrastructure, it is our responsibility.' That is the head of Telstra saying that they own the infrastructure and it is their responsibility. So clearly Telstra has stepped up, as is appropriate, and taken responsibility for its infrastructure, and so it should.                 On asbestos generally, of course this government takes the view that if there is a hazard in our nation then we are concerned to do everything we can to support community members who are worried about that hazard in their environment and their lives and to support the removal of that hazard from people's lives. That is why this is the government that has stepped up to having better approaches on asbestos, as the Minister for Workplace Relations has outlined to the parliament today. I am concerned whenever I hear that anybody has become worried or has become exposed to asbestos. We all should be concerned about that.                     I was asked about the question of responsibility and I have quoted the CEO of Telstra and his words, 'We own the infrastructure, it is our responsibility.' But the government has not been content to just say this is a matter for Telstra; the government through the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Minister for Communications convened a meeting yesterday because we want to see everything that can be done being done. That is the government's approach. I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that as we take that approach we will deal with people respectfully, and that is a sharp contrast to how he has approached these questions in the past.

  I thank the member for Chifley for his question. This government is very proud of the fact that we have established the Parliamentary Budget Office, which provides an unprecedented opportunity for members of parliament to go and get their policies independently costed. That means that now, for the first time, there will be absolutely no excuses for parties to avoid getting their policies independently costed and having them out there before the Australian people before the election.                 Of course, we have all seen the Leader of the Opposition out there running around with his so-called 'real plan' - that little pamphlet that he sticks up under his chin when he does a television interview. He tell us that he has a real plan, but we are just months out from the election and we still do not have a single properly costed policy from the opposition. That is because they are determined to hide their plans from the Australian people.                 I read in the Daily Telegraph today that the member for North Sydney has issued a gag order on coalition MPs and coalition candidates talking to the Parliamentary Budget Office 'over fears that new laws will expose the coalition to greater scrutiny'. Well, we would not want that! It just goes to show you the extent to which they will go to avoid having their policies exposed to any scrutiny.                 I do note that, to his credit, when the Leader of the Opposition was asked about this today, he said, 'Well, this is all news to me.' But I would have thought that, if the member for North Sydney was writing to his colleagues, the Leader of the Opposition would be at the very top of his mailing list, because when it comes to unfunded and uncosted policies, he is the chief architect. He is the one responsible for their $20 billion paid parental leave cash splash. He is the one that is responsible for the billions of dollars that they want to waste -                      He wants to waste billions of dollars handing out money to polluters. And what about that other one, the Northern Australia policy, where they are going to build all of these dams around the place and are going to gold-plate footpaths up in Northern Australia. None of these policies are costed. It is all starting to look like there is a pattern here of those opposite trying to hide their plans from the Australian people.                 We all know they are not going to release the nastiest of their policies now; they are saving them for the secret commission of cuts. But now it looks as though they do not want any of their policies to be exposed to any scrutiny ahead of the election and they will not be sending any to the Parliamentary Budget Office. I have to say that there is one thing that should scare every Australian family. What we saw at the last election with their $11 billion black hole is nothing; if they were to get elected at the next election their big black hole will be paid for by every Australian family, and that will be through savage cuts to the bone.

  As I have already advised the House and the honourable member, there is a process in place and there is a determination to be made by ASIO in relation to these matters. I will not be answering hypotheticals as to what would occur after a security agency makes an assessment in relation to these matters. But you can be assured that they will make those decisions and advise the government and we will ensure that the Australian people will be safe.                 The one thing I will not do is take advice from the those members opposite who were members of the Howard government, who of course have got an extraordinary record on national security. Seven hundred people escaped from immigration detention in two days in June 2000. They unlawfully deported an Australian citizen. They unlawfully detained an Australian permanent resident. They deported an Indian doctor that they falsely claimed to be a terrorist. That is the record of the Howard government. We do not need any lectures from you, I can assure you.

  Once again we have had more fiction from the shadow Treasurer about debt. I want to go through all of the facts. The first fact is that net debt at 11.4 per cent is a fraction of debt levels of other countries right around the world. In fact, it is one-eighth the level of major advanced economies. I make that point because those opposite are on this fiscal fear campaign that somehow our debt levels are not responsible and not sustainable. We have very low debt and sustainable debt in this country and it performs a very important role. When events occur in the international economy, we support jobs and growth, and that is what this government is doing. Of course, those opposite do not want to do that.                 I was questioned by the shadow Treasurer on those matters in the House only a few weeks ago, the week after the budget, and I made a number of important points. I said that the borrowing limit did not need to be lifted in either this financial year, 2012-13, or next financial year, 2013-14. I did that in the face of the shadow Treasurer running around mixing up market value and face value - he did not know what he was doing at all.                     I said we will also review that in the usual way and amend it as required. Face value was never provided by those opposite when they were in government; it was never published. But today face value was provided to Senate estimates. I talked with the Treasury. It was the most open and transparent thing to do and it was provided to the opposition today. So the government has been completely open and transparent in providing the face value figures, which have never been provided by those opposite. The face value in 2012-13 and 2013-14 is below the debt cap. I also made the point that these matters are considered on a budget to budget basis in the usual way and we would review it in the usual way and amend it as required. That is actually what I told the parliament when these matters were raised with me in budget week.                   But what is this all about? What this is really all about is that debt is the Trojan Horse that those opposite are trying to use, trying to exaggerate its impact so that they will be able to justify if elected savage cuts to the bone when it comes to health and education and a massive impact on jobs and growth in our community. Debt in this country is low. Our public finances are in great shape, and the problem that those opposite have got is that this is what the rating agencies say about these matters. This demonstrates how those opposite want to talk down our economy day in, day out. This is what Standard &amp; Poor's says about Australia: 'The government continues to demonstrate a commitment to prudent fiscal policy over the medium term given the low level of public debt in Australia.' This is what Moody's says about it: 'Australia's relatively low level of government debt has been one of the factors supporting the AAA rating.'

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question and I am absolutely delighted that today this House of the parliament passed the Australian Education Bill; that is, we endorsed for Australia's children a better education for the future. We endorsed a method of properly funding our children, our teachers and our classrooms for generations to come. And in saying yes to every child realising their full potential, this House today also said yes to a stronger economy in the future.                 First, to the member for Greenway, we do know from the education reforms that we have brought to date that we can improve children's education, we can make sure that kids get a better education and that student results are lifted. I point to examples like St John's Primary School Auburn, with about 260 kids, most of them from a background where they speak a language other than English. We have invested an extra $915,000 in this school and year-on-year standards are improving. In year 3 reading is up five per cent. By year 5 it is up seven per cent, and numeracy is up a staggering 26 per cent. That is one example in one school where extra resources combined with new ways of working have lifted up the standards for our children and enabled them to achieve their full potential. And if you can do it in one school then you can do it in all schools. And if you do it across our schooling system and we achieve our year 12 attainment goals then that means a stronger economy, a gain to the economy of around $11.3 billion, or $416 per person.                 You would think that in this parliament there could be a moment of unity around replacing our broken system of funding schools at the moment with a system that will work for all schools for the future, getting it right for generations to come, enabling our children to reach their full potential, enabling our economy to be stronger for the future. But, unfortunately, today we did not see that moment of unity. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition voted no to better education for our children. They voted no to a stronger economy in the future.                 On this side of the House we understand that there is nothing more important to parents than their child's future: the quality of the teacher in the classroom, the access to specialist teachers, the access to equipment, the access to help if they need it and to programs for gifted children who are doing absolutely their best and achieving at the peak. That is what we are promising every Australian school, and we will continue to fight for this funding reform in every school.

  Can I say that I do welcome these questions. I hope I get 10 on this question, because what we have had now is further deception from the shadow Treasurer. What he has done is quote selectively from the Hansard. I went on to say:                 _ we will review it in the usual way and, if it were necessary, we would lift it.                 That is the bit that he did not actually quote today, because this is part of the continuing deception. And the continuing deception is that somehow Australia has an unsustainable level of debt, when in fact net debt peaks at 11.4 per cent of GDP in 2014-15 - about one-eighth of the level of major advanced economies.                 We have to stand back and look at where Australia is, because with our low and responsible levels of debt our economy has grown 14 per cent since the end of 2007. I will tell you what that means: 950,000 jobs! That is because we on this side of the House had the guts to support our economy, unlike those who came into this House and the Leader of the Opposition, who slept through the critical vote on the stimulus package and would not support jobs and growth in our economy. We are prepared to take the responsible decisions, as the ratings agencies have said, to have a low level of debt to support jobs, growth and employment security in our economy.                 What he is really saying today is that he is outing their hidden agenda, and their hidden agenda is to run a gigantic scare campaign about debt as their excuse for cutting to the bone.                     Both the finance minister and I spoke with the Treasury and said that it would be a good idea for them to put them on the record in estimates because these have never been provided in this way before. They were never provided by those opposite when they were in government. So, once again, another deception. It is all part of their fiscal fear mongering.                 What this is all about is an attempt to bully the Australian nation into the unwinding of the social safety net, and massive cuts to health and education a la Campbell Newman. His commission of cuts was all about hiding the truth before the election. What they want to do is go to the election pretending Australia has an unsustainable level of debt and that therefore there will have to be very big cuts to public expenditure after the election.                 Now, there are just a couple of problems with that. The rating agencies recognise how responsible our fiscal policy is, which is why we have a AAA rating from the three global rating agencies - with a stable outlook for the first time in our nation's history. That fact is very embarrassing for those opposite because we understand the importance of good, strong fiscal policy to support jobs and growth, unlike those who want to cut to the bone in health and education and to cut jobs.

  I want to thank the member for Robertson for her question. She has been a strong advocate for education both in this parliament and in her electorate, with the delivery of over $77 million for some 97 projects - 30 classrooms, eight multipurpose halls and five trade training centres - in the electorate of Robertson. She knows, as we all do on this side of the House, that this is a genuinely historic day in education in Australian history.                 It is a day that has been a long time coming, and I want to while I am at the dispatch box place my appreciation for the efforts of all those people in both the government and non-government education sectors, including Mr Gonski and his panellists, who provided the clear thinking and the recommendations that this government could take and work with for a new, fairer funding model for school education for all schools around Australia.                 That is why this reform is so substantial. Yes, there is additional investment that comes with this reform and we committed to it in the budget. But the key thing here is this: every dollar in education that any government spends under this framework in the legislation that passed through this House today is directed at the needs - the individual needs - of students in schools, government and non-government. That is a powerful, transforming reform and a great improvement to the way in which we find schools now and the way that the Leader of the Opposition is still committed to.                 I do not have to go far afield to find support for this proposition. Only in the last day or so we had the Australian Industry Group standing up and saying quite clearly that the needs-based funding reform is an essential thing that we need to do - its principles are fundamentally sound. We had the education minister from New South Wales come down here and actively lobby his National Party counterparts on the other side of the House on that very measure as well.                 For people in the bush this is such a strong driver of economic vitality and social vitality. The fact is that the loadings in this model recognise disadvantage wherever it occurs, whether it is in rural or regional Australia and whether it is in electorates that have a great deal of disadvantage. I know members on the Labor side of the House understand that only too well.                 This is an important day and it is a day which vindicates the significant reforms and high levels of investment that have been the hallmark of this Labor government ever since we came to office. We are pioneering and pushing forward reform which is aimed at lifting educational performance in every school around the nation and lifting the nation as a whole. This legislation passed through the House. The only people who do not want better schools for Australia are the opposition.

  To the Leader of the Opposition: already so clearly in this question time we have seen the divide in Australian politics between this government that is building and investing for the future and this opposition that is trading in fear - trying to trade in fear and make people worry about the economy, when they know that there is no cause to do so and the rating agencies have spoken. Then, with a question like this, it is trying to raise fear in the community when it knows, and the Leader of the Opposition knows, from answers that have been given in this parliament earlier this week that the person he refers to has always been held in detention. The Leader of the Opposition is out there trying to create fear and people might want to ask themselves why? Why would he be creating fear? Not because he has any answers, that is for sure. The Leader of the Opposition used to walk around saying: 'Stop the boats.'                   The member for                    Cowan                    then left the chamber.                     Now, of course, they have back-pedalled and back-pedalled. They might hope to make some difference in a few years time, if that is possible. Then the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is out there, effectively claiming that they have got an arrangement with Indonesia. Then she had to back-pedal, back-pedal and back-pedal. Then she was shamed into trying to stutter out the truth by The Guardiannewspaper -                      So all of this fear -                      raised by an opposition, which, if it were clear and if it were truthful would say that its policies amount to nothing.                     I am answering a question very broadly worded about safety and, in answering that very broadly worded question, let me give this answer. What this government will do is continue to be clear with people about the facts and the policy choices. We will listen to expert advice.                     The member for Indi might think that advice provided by the former Chief of the Defence Force is worth laughing at. We treat people who have served our Defence Force at the highest level with respect. We treat people with the foreign policy expertise of Michael L'Estrange with respect. We treat a man, like Paris Aristotle, who has devoted his life to working with refugees with respect. We of course are out there implementing the policies that have been recommended by those experts while, on the one hand, the opposition come into this parliament and try to raise fear and then, on the other hand, whenever they are called to do so come into this parliament and put up their hands for more votes, which is what the Leader of the Opposition has done time after time in denying the force and effect of the expert panel.

  To the member for Denison, of course PNG is a sovereign nation so it has the ability to control who gets visas and who enters PNG. I think that is self-evident.                 In terms of people who are in PNG and who then seek access to the detention centre on Manus Island, unlike the former Howard government, we have been in the business of enabling there to be transparency about what is happening in detention centres. That is why, for example, the Red Cross has been able to travel to that centre and it is why the International Organization for Migration has been able to travel to that centre and it is why, indeed, even Senator Hanson-Young in the other chamber has been able to travel to that centre. So in terms of openness and transparency, that is the track record of the government.                 When it comes to why we have people in offshore processing, it comes to the same answer that I just gave to the Leader of the Opposition, although I understand the member for Denison is coming at this from a very different perspective.                     Thank you very much, Speaker. I have made clear the way in which people have been given access to the centre, including a parliamentarian from this parliament. My point to the member for Denison is: the reason we have a centre in PNG, the reason we have offshore processing, is that it was recommended by the expert panel and we are implementing their recommendations. Of course, we have been prevented from doing so fully because of the negativity of the opposition, the opposition having consistently wanted to see more boats.

  I thank the member for Wakefield for his question because today's National Accounts confirm that Australia's economy continues to outperform the rest of the developed world - 0.6 per cent in the quarter, 2.5 per cent throughout the year. This is a strong result for Australia. It is a solid result which is testament to our economic resilience. Our economy is growing faster than just about every other developed economy in the global economy, three times faster than the OECD average. This has been achieved despite the fact that there is global uncertainty and of course despite the very big transitions that are going on in our economy.                 It comes at a time when we have seen recession again in Europe. We have seen something like six straight quarters of negative growth in Europe, the worst they have experienced since the Great Depression. Nine out of 23 advanced economies have reported March quarter results that have contracted during that quarter. So there is a very difficult global outlook.                 This also comes at a time when the dollar has been high, and it is certainly bearing down on many industry sectors as we are trying to make the transition from mining sources of growth to nonmining sources of growth. We say that this is a very solid result. The outcome of this is that our economy is now 14 per cent larger than it was at the end of 2007. So we have an impressive array of strengths - solid growth, low unemployment, contained inflation, a AAA credit rating and record low interest rates.                 What we have to do now is continue to get the big economic calls right, and getting the big economic calls right means making the smart investments for the future within a strong fiscal policy. That is why I was so proud that the parliament this morning passed the education bill. You could not get anything more fundamental to the future of our country than this education bill. It stands alongside other big reforms - the NDIS, the stimulus packages that we put in place back in 2008-09 - and is a very substantial achievement for this parliament, a historic day for all our children in this country.                 We want to ensure that every child gets a good education and that none is left behind. The danger we have here is that people outside New South Wales are going to be left behind. They will be left behind in my home state of Queensland. We have got a big game tonight and the Maroons are going to do well. But what we want to see is Queensland kids doing well as well in the education race and not being left behind the students in New South Wales. There are only two people standing in the road of that - the Leader of the Opposition and the Premier of Queensland. They ought to get out of the way so that we can get this reform in place and decent education for kids right around our country.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. The reference in the letter goes to three particular persons that I was asked about by the honourable member, and I confirmed by way of letter that there was some progress.                 But in relation to the one individual, the one that was raised in question time yesterday, the assessment of that individual had not commenced. So the response in the letter went to three people; the question to me yesterday went to one person. And in relation to that person, his assessment had not commenced.

  I want to thank the member for Lyons for his question. I know that he knows how much power education has for changing the opportunities for regional Australians. I know how important this government's education reforms will be for students right across Australia, reforms that have now passed this House despite being opposed by the opposition.                 The government's National Plan for School Improvement will deliver around $6 billion in additional funding for regional and remote schools over the next six years. This is a critical investment in delivering a stronger, smarter and fairer Australia. We are making this investment because we believe every student deserves access to the best-quality education regardless of where they live. We know that from OECD studies there is a difference between the performance results of metropolitan and remote schools. Indeed, 15-year-old students enrolled in rural schools are the equivalent of 1½ years behind their city counterparts for reading, maths and scientific literacy. That is why the government has a plan to make sure schools in regional and remote Australia will have the resources they need to overcome this disadvantage.                 Under the National Plan for School Improvement, education funding is delivered to those areas most in need. We recognise that schools in rural Australia face unique challenges because of their location and often because of their size. Under our plan, smaller schools will receive extra funding, in recognition that they need additional resources, so they can offer their students the same services as those in larger schools. That is why around 40 per cent of the additional investment in education over the next six years will go to regional and remote schools.                     Absolutely. The reforms that have passed the House today will mean that children in regional Australia will get extra help if they need it. The reforms will mean that regional students will have access to more resources, more skilled teachers who will stay in regional Australia - reforms that the opposition voted against - and money and opportunities that would never be realised under the coalition.                 The New South Wales Minister for Education, a member of the Nationals, who represents the people of regional Australia, knows how important this is. I know there are National members who care deeply in this House about their communities - communities outside those major metropolitan cities that do not have access to the same educational opportunities as people in larger cities. I know there are National members who want students in their electorates to have the best chance of a great education. Sadly, they have tied themselves to the coalition's decision to deny regional and remote schools additional resources. People in regional Australia will have an absolutely clear choice - a choice between an additional $6 billion over the next six years for regional schools or cuts of $16.2 billion under the coalition.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. I first refer him to the statement I made just before question time in relation to those matters. As I made clear in parliament last night, I received information for the very first time with respect to this matter on 17 April. That brief went to the transfer of the person in question from one centre to the other. Of course, that was the appropriate thing to do.                 What I said throughout the course of the questions put to me in relation to this matter -                      What I have said in relation to this matter when being asked questions is that at all times our agencies have worked together - that is, ASIO, the Australian Federal Police and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. As a result, this person has been in detention at all times.

  I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. She is a passionate advocate of investment in the Bruce Highway, particularly in her area of Queensland. Indeed, we have delivered, through work such as at Yeppoon, the works on the Bruce Highway as part of the announcement that we had in the budget of a $4.1 billion, 10-year plan, bringing our total investment in the Bruce since we came to office in 2007 to some $5.7 billion - real money for real projects to make a real difference. The Leader of the Nationals, indeed, called upon us to match Queensland's billion-dollar commitment for the Bruce Highway. He said this in July last year:                 Campbell Newman has committed the incoming LNP government to an extra billion dollars for the Bruce Highway. Clearly the federal government needs to match that offer.                 Well, we didn't match it with a billion dollars; we have $4.1 billion on the table. I would have expected, in yesterday's budget by the Queensland government, to actually see some funds. But I looked for it in the budget and I saw the Queensland transport minister say that they will deliver a record $690 million for the Bruce Highway. I thought, 'Well, that's all right - $690 million. I wonder how much of it is Queensland money and how much is from the federal government?' I thought maybe half - maybe $395 million. Nah. Of the $690 million they claim, $587 million is from this Treasurer's budget. There is $103 million from Queensland - that's all. We are putting in 85 per cent of the funding and they are claiming 100 per cent of the credit. And they say that this is their big priority.                 But it gets worse, because they wrote to us about the Cross River Rail project. They said, 'If you put in $715 million we'll put in $715 million.' I looked for it. Not a zack, not a cent, for the Cross River Rail project. But it gets better, because today we find out they have an alternative plan for the congestion! They are going to rip seats out of the trains and make people stand up. That is the Newman government's solution to congestion on the rail system in Brisbane. That is austerity in practice. That is the position that this bloke, who has said he won't put one cent into the Cross River Rail project, endorses with his inaction. The combination is diabolical and it is a farce. Queenslanders deserve better.

  I thank the shadow minister for his question. The Australian Federal Police are an outstanding organisation. They do important work and they do it very well. I see in the gallery today Mr Mark Burgess who represents the Police Federation of Australia. He represents the police forces all across Australia who all do great work on our behalf. It is good to have him here today.                 As the shadow minister knows, and I told him this in parliament last night, there is a separation between operational work and policy work. I have confidence in the Australian Federal Police to advise me on the details that they think appropriate when they think that is appropriate. What I will not do is second-guess the Australian Federal Police on what the Federal Police think is appropriate to brief me on. When I was briefed on this matter by the Australian Federal Police, I asked them to work with DIAC on the review that they are conducting and that is ongoing and that, I think, is appropriate.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. For the information of the House, the member for Deakin has been working with the Panlock family who are constituents in his electorate. Their daughter tragically took her own life after being bullied at work. So this is a very important issue to him.                 He believes - as I do and as this government does, and as I believe everyone in the House does - that everyone who goes to work should come home safe. There are no other sets of circumstances which would ever be supported.                 The Productivity Commission has estimated that bullying in the workplace costs somewhere between $6 billion and $36 billion. The Gillard government generally wants to address the economic and emotional cost of bullying in the workplace. I have worked with the Panlock family and others. There are no dollars possible to rate the cost of the loss of their daughter's life and the tragedy and the repercussions that continue on forever from that.                 We have provided the Fair Work Commission an extra $21.4 million over the next four years to help people who are bullied at work to get help quickly and affordably. I acknowledge that on 9 May those opposite said that they wanted to address workplace bullying. I quote from their policy:                 Labor has promised to amend the Fair Work laws to include bullying. The Coalition will support Labor's proposed changes.                 That is good; a tick for that. The coalition said they would support the government's legislation which delivered a key recommendation of the parliament's bullying inquiry and which was an individual right of recourse for victims of workplace bullying. However, to my disappointment, I read in today's Australian Financial Review on page 3 that the coalition apparently is going to move amendments and excise bullying provisions. I am sad to report to the House that the Financial Review has reported that the decision to move amendments to strike out tougher workplace bullying laws, which would see bullying complaints referred to the Fair Work Commission, is a surprise as the coalition's industrial relations policy document indicated support for the move.                 What I do hope here - and I mean this with all sincerity - is that there are some people opposite who just want to tackle the issue of workplace bullying. I believe that. I also understand that there is probably the pragmatic small-target brigade on IR within the opposition central ranks who probably want to silence some of the far-right-wing nutters who exist in the Liberal Party on IR. Either the Financial Review is lying or someone in the opposition is. Sorry, I withdraw that. That is unparliamentary.                     Labor knows that bullying is a problem. I know that your average rank-and-file Liberal MP knows it is a problem. Let us all get behind tackling workplace bullying.                     I withdraw.

  What a disgrace this opposition is. They are a disgrace because they seek to make a political plaything out of national security. We know that they are seeking to make a plaything out of national security because of this question.                     Thank you, Speaker. I was briefed by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation on 24 April this year in relation to this matter. I say again that the ongoing attack on our national security agencies by this opposition is outrageous. It is further indication that the only interest that this opposition has in national security is to use it as a political football.                 And rather than second-guessing our security agencies, rather than attacking our security agencies, which is what they are seeking to do, rather than second-guessing the briefings that they receive on our national security activities, they should explain how their cuts to the bone and their cuts to national security would affect the national security of our country.                     The recent review of the administration and expenditure of our security agencies and our intelligence agencies, tabled just last Monday by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, found that when it comes to visa security and to security checking the joint parliamentary committee was:                   _                    satisfied that the current regime for visa security assessments is the correct one.                 The fact is that this government has increased the resources that ASIO has to meet an increasing caseload. ASIO is managing those resources in an effective and efficient manner and it does this by determining, through a triage process, which cases should undergo a full security assessment. I want to quote someone else. This is what the Director-General of ASIO said at the recent Senate estimates hearing:                 In the circumstances -                  this is the Director-General of ASIO -                  I would submit that the triaging process is the most effective and efficient way of enabling the greatest resources to be applied to the greatest potential risk.                 He went on to say:                 With a properly managed risk management system you can reduce the risk very considerably by focusing on real problems.                 If the opposition is saying that it knows how to manage national security assessments better than ASIO, then it should say how it would do it differently and what it would cost. It is very clear I cannot and will not comment on individual cases, but I would say it is important to note that the individual in question has been in detention at all times since he arrived in Australia.

  I thank the member for Page for her question. Labor supports renewable energy because it is fundamental to our capacity to tackle climate change and to ensure that our economy will be competitive in the years ahead.                     It is important to report to the House that since the carbon price began on 1 July last year, renewable energy generation is up almost 30 per cent -                      and generation from the most emissions-intensive electricity generators is down 14 per cent. Renewable energy up 30 per cent; highly-polluting power stations down 14 per cent. In fact, emissions in the national electricity market are down 7.4 per cent since carbon pricing began. That is an equivalent of 12 million tonnes reduced in greenhouse gas emissions.                 There is an industry report out today - Clean energy Australia - that also demonstrates other benefits of the policies that the government has introduced. In 2012 enough renewable energy, for example, was generated to power more than four million homes. Under Labor, one million solar panel systems have been installed on rooftops around the country, compared to just over 7,000 under the Howard government in seven years. One million - achieved by this government. Employment in renewable energy has more than doubled in four years to 24,300. Wind-power-generating capacity has almost trebled since the government came to power. Australians now face a very clear choice on the issue of renewable energy. Our policies - carbon pricing, which is working; the legislated renewable energy target; the Clean Energy Finance Corporation; the Australian Renewable Energy Agency - all of these things are driving significant investment in renewables.                 On the other side the coalition wants to take a wrecking ball to the lot. In fact, on Adelaide radio recently, the opposition leader was complaining that the renewable energy target would lead to too much renewable energy. Those opposite are out there trying to bully the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, demanding that it defy the law, defy the parliament, defy the Constitution and stop investing in renewable energy and clean technologies. Their threats to remove the carbon price are destroying investment certainty and last week, when given the opportunity to explain his position on climate change, all the opposition leader could say about it and the science that underpins it was that 'something is happening'. We will tell you what is happening: greenhouse gas emissions are down under carbon pricing; the economy is strong; one million solar panels; renewable energy is up 30 per cent; there is a doubling of jobs in renewable technologies. That is what is happening.

  To the Leader of the Opposition's question I say no amount of spin or trying to raise fear changes the facts here. First and foremost - and I know that when faced with the facts a bit of screaming and distraction has to go on - the facts are these: the person he refers to was always in detention. The language that the Leader of the Opposition is using for these questions, and has clearly instructed others to use when they ask questions, is deliberately calibrated to give people another impression. This person was always in detention.                 On the facts of the matter I refer the Leader of the Opposition to the statement of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship shortly before question time. I also refer him to people who would know more than he does about security assessments, particularly the Director-General of ASIO -                      The question asked contained wide-ranging imputations. Those opposite are out there trying to raise fear and I am going to answer them because I am not going to leave that uncorrected on the national record. Point No. 1 that the Leader of the Opposition has failed to say: this person was always in detention. Point No. 2 that the Leader of the Opposition has failed to say: I refer him to someone who knows more about national security than he does, someone he may never have met because he has not availed himself of appropriate briefings - that is, the Director-General of ASIO. The Director-General of ASIO said about security assessments, 'The triaging process is the most effective and efficient way of enabling the greatest resources to be applied to the greatest potential risk.' The Leader of the Opposition does not know more about these questions than the Director-General of ASIO.                 On briefings to me: I was briefed after the matter was raised in Senate estimates. On briefings to the immigration minister: the immigration minister has dealt very clearly with that on the record today. On discussions in the National Security Committee, in which the Leader of the Opposition has never sat: if he had ever sat in the National Security Committee he would know that discussions in the National Security Committee are confidential.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. I know the member for La Trobe understands that this government has set aside almost $3 billion to meet our fair share of the social and community services equal pay decision. This investment today is delivering certainty not only to those workers affected by this decision but also to the community service organisations that employ them.                 We know that these workers are some of the lowest paid in Australia. Many of us - including the member for La Trobe - are aware of the dedicated work that these professionals do, day in and day out, in their local communities. But for far too long this work has been undervalued, and for far too long it has been seen as women's work. As a result the community sector has been underpaid. This government has been working hard to turn this around.                 Fair Work Australia's historic equal remuneration order last year means that social and community service workers right across Australia are already getting paid more. Indeed, their salaries were increased from 1 December last year. These wage increases will lift the salaries of workers in this sector by between 23 and 45 per cent over the eight years of this decision. We know that the social and community service workers in this industry are predominantly female, and 120,000 of the 150,000 workers in this area are women. We know that this is a long-overdue victory for the community sector, and a significant advance for the equal pay of women.                 This government wants to ensure that Australian social and community service workers have their proper reward secured now and into the future, and that is why this government has already met its obligations to its own funded programs.                 But I would like to update the House on progress on agreements with the states and territories, particularly those that fund the workers under the national agreements. Last month South Australia accepted the Commonwealth's offer, and I am pleased to advise that this week the Australian Capital Territory has also accepted the Commonwealth's offer. These agreements represent the Commonwealth's fair share of these pay rises and include conditions specifically focused to ensure that this money flows directly to the workers. I strongly encourage the remaining states and territories to follow the lead of South Australia and the ACT.                 These reforms are part of this government's vision for a stronger, smarter and fairer Australia, but it is a far cry from what is on offer from those opposite. Indeed, we have seen it in Queensland. The Campbell Newman government has already taken an axe to community service workers in Queensland. We should be very clear that what we are seeing in Queensland is what we will get from those opposite. The Australian people have a clear choice between this government's stronger, smarter and fairer Australia and what those opposite are offering.

  Thank you very much. First, to the Leader of the Opposition: the person he refers to was always in detention, and no rhetorical flourish makes a difference to that. Second, it is the Leader of the Opposition who does not get national security briefings. Third, I can inform the House that today I have directed the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security to examine the management by the Australian government agencies of persons -                      I had assumed that the opposition would want to hear this; but, as usual, we get the 'national security is a plaything' response, so I will start that sentence again, and maybe we can have some silence and respect in the House for national security -                      Clearly not, because it is just a game to the opposition. But, I inform those people in the parliament and beyond who are actually seriously concerned - so, to others than the opposition - that today I have directed the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security to examine the management of Australian government agencies of persons seeking asylum who present complex security issues, particularly this case.

  I thank the member for Bass for his question. This government has been delivering real tax reform to ensure that hardworking Australian families and small businesses are able to get a fair share and a fair go. On top of three rounds of tax cuts that we have delivered since 2008 we have tripled the tax-free threshold, we have introduced the instant asset write-off for small businesses and now are interesting loss carry-back, and we have also cut taxes on superannuation for the lowest paid of our workers.                 Every single one of these measures has been opposed by those opposite, and I am not surprised because, when it comes to tax reform, those opposite think that tax reform is a three-letter word. It is 'GST'. GST is what is in their DNA. They were the ones who introduced it. We know they always wanted to put it on everything and, if they get half a chance, they will come back and try to do the same again. We are against that because we know any plan to increase the GST will smash families, smash pensioners and tie businesses - in particular small businesses - up with even more red tape.                 But don't take my word for it; listen to what their Liberal state premier family out there calling for an increase in the GST are saying. Look at what Premier O'Farrell has had to say. He says:                 All options should be on the table, broadening the base, looking at the rate and also the rebates back to the states.                 And it is not just the Liberal state premiers. Go have a look at the mentors of the Leader of the Opposition - John Howard and Nick Minchin - who are all out there saying: 'Come on, Tony! Come back! Finish the job! We wanted to put it on in the first place; now you finish the job.'                     But it is not just the old guard. We know the member for Mayo supports jacking up the GST. The member for Stirling was out there recently saying it should be on the table. Just yesterday we heard from the former WA Treasurer and the soon-to-be Liberal candidate for Pearce, and he was out there saying we should jack up the GST as well. Not only was he saying that; he said, 'We need to rip money away from states like Tasmania and South Australia to pay for it.' That is what they believe in.                 So we have this chorus of conservatives out there all calling for an increase in the GST, and what do we hear from the Leader of the Opposition? All we get from the Leader of the Opposition is, 'I won't rule that out.' Of course he will not rule it out. He will not rule it out, because that is exactly what he intends to do. He says he wants a GST review. We all know the tax review he calls for will be a GST review. It will be a vehicle to jack up the GST. We are a government that will stand up against the Liberal state premiers. The coalition, on the other hand, introduced it. It is in their DNA, and they are just champing at the bit, hoping to get an opportunity to come back and finish the job.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. These, of course, are very serious matters. As I said earlier this week, it is important that the honourable member, and other members who have sought a briefing, get a briefing on those matters. I can, however, confirm in response to the question in relation to that matter that the advice I have received is that there are no other IMAs in the detention network who have been identified as having an Interpol red notice. That is a very important piece of advice and I think it is therefore incumbent upon our agencies to continue to work professionally and dedicate themselves to ensure that they protect the community. I can assure the honourable member our agencies are doing just that.

  I thank the member for Throsby for his very important question and also his ongoing advocacy for workers in the Illawarra in his electorate who are concerned about ensuring that their jobs are protected and also the opportunities they and the young people in Illawarra have to be trained and fill jobs before employers seek to fill those jobs from temporary overseas workers.                 Can I say today we have introduced into the House very important legislation that ensures that Australian residents and citizens will be preferred before employers can seek applications for temporary skilled workers. That is a very important piece of public policy and I will tell you why. There are legitimate reasons for the temporary skilled stream, and there are employers who do the right thing, but there are people who can be exploited if there is a misuse of the scheme. You might want to read the Fairfax newspaper. Firstly, there are those overseas workers who have been exploited, underpaid and treated very shabbily and badly and in many cases it would appear unlawfully. That is unfair. We need to make sure we protect the interests of those workers. We also have to ensure that the 457 scheme is not being used in a manner that actually deprives and denies workers in this country getting jobs first.                  I refer to the Migration Council of Australia's survey where they said 15 per cent of employers in this country have no trouble at all finding local employment and yet they do not employ locals. That is a damning statistic and it should not happen. That same survey said that seven per cent of 457 applicants were paid less than Australian workers. That should not happen. It is not fair for the overseas worker, it is not fair for the Australian worker who misses out and it is not fair for the employer who does the right thing and uses the 457 scheme properly and is at a competitive disadvantage against the employer who does the wrong thing.                  This is very important public policy. That is why we have taken steps to fix the problem identified in the scheme. We have announced regulations to tighten the scheme and today we have introduced legislation that requires employers in the majority of occupations to show that they have genuinely sought labour locally by putting an ad in the newspaper, in a trade publication or website before being given access to the 457 scheme. They will have to satisfy the department that they have genuinely looked for local workers before they filled those positions with temporary skilled workers from overseas.

  I have announced an inquiry because I happen to think that facts matter. I know that they are alien to the Leader of the Opposition but I do believe it is important that facts matter and that this matter is the subject of an inquiry by an independent officeholder. I understand that a little bit earlier today the Leader of the Opposition was himself saying there should be an independent inquiry. Well, there is an independent inquiry, as announced by me yesterday.                 To the Leader of the Opposition more generally, what we have seen from the opposition across this parliamentary fortnight is an ill-informed fear campaign. We had the Leader of the Opposition claiming ASIO resources had been cut across the life of this government - that is not true, but not surprising, given he has never been briefed by ASIO during the life of this parliament. Then, of course, Senator Brandis, who was briefed by ASIO, could not wait to rush up to a TV camera to burble out what he had been briefed on. Then, of course, yesterday we had the unedifying spectacle of the shadow minister for immigration trying to have a parliamentary committee, without statutory authority to investigate this matter, do that investigation. Then of course the member for Stirling could not approach the dispatch box and even move a motion. On top of all of that -                      Thank you very much. Then in terms of the campaign that has been pursued by the opposition: wrong on ASIO; then revealing an ASIO briefing; the shadow minister for immigration wrong on the powers of a parliamentary committee; the member for Stirling unable to approach the dispatch box and use the words 'I seek leave'; the Deputy Leader of the Opposition out, nudge-nudge, wink-wink, 'We've got an arrangement with Indonesia' and then having to shamble away from all of that - across this week when we have had to listen to so much nonsense from the opposition on national security, I think at the end of the week that has been we are entitled to say that every day the opposition has put in a performance where it has had no acquaintance with the facts. A fact has never actually mattered to them: not about ASIO resources; not about our relationship with Indonesia; not about who can mount what sort of inquiry. So, to the Leader of the Opposition -                      if he is interested in a bit of humility, he might want to start with some humility about the opposition's performance this week and he might also want to verify to the Australian people that they have no solutions on border security. They have been stepping away, piece by piece, from any representations about results in border security - no answers, just a campaign of fear where the facts have never mattered.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. I understand now that the opposition will chat amongst themselves because we are talking about a topic so incredibly boring to them: that is, the future of the Australian nation and investing in Australia's children. Of course they are bored, because they have no agenda to improve schools. Indeed, they have a plan to make schools $16.2 billion worse off. I am asked by the member for Robertson, who cares so passionately about education: what are the government's plans?                 I want to start this answer by noting that whilst we have just continued wrecking by the opposition saying no to investing in the potential of every Australian child, saying no to making us a stronger, smarter nation in the future, not every conservative in the country is taking this wrecking approach. I point to the approach being taken by the Minister for Education in New South Wales, Mr Piccoli, who on an earlier occasion I did insult by referring to him as a Liberal - he is a National Party member. He is out there trying to convince other conservatives in the nation that it is important to invest in the future of children. He, as a conservative, is prepared to put children first. And he, as a conservative, has yet again put a skewer into those who are seeking to deny Australian children the quality education they need.                 In particular, he has been very clear about how good a deal this is for New South Wales. Mr Piccoli said:                 There's nothing secret about it, we are trying to get all the facts out there. The briefings -                  those are the briefings that Mr Piccoli is doing himself -                  are to say that this is what we have signed and why we have signed and why we think it's a good deal. It's about putting policy ahead of politics, which is the one thing people always ask politicians to do.                 Mr Piccoli goes on to say:                 I hope all the states sign up.                 Mr Piccoli is right. He is showing that it is possible to be a conservative and to care about the future of Australian children. It is possible to be a conservative and work with a federal Labor government that is determined to invest in every child's future and to properly resource our teachers, classrooms and children for generations and generations to come.                 I recommend to those opposite, who are not at all interested in education, who have no plan for Australian schools except cuts to the bone, that they listen to the wise words of Mr Piccoli; he cares about Australia's children and Australia's future. Why can't this opposition do the same?

  I refer the Leader of the National Party to my earlier answer and to the shambles we have seen across this parliamentary fortnight from the opposition. He is sitting next to the deputy leader; does he think she has to deal with Indonesia? Yes or no?                     I can understand why the Leader of the National Party does not want me to go down that track; it is too embarrassing for them. I refer the Leader of the National Party to my answers across this parliamentary fortnight where I have detailed the facts about ASIO resourcing, as opposed to the opposition's fear campaign; where I have detailed the facts about what we can do to inquire into this matter, as opposed to the silly proposal from the opposition to try and give it to a parliamentary committee without power; where we have dealt with the facts of our relationship with Indonesia, rather than silly claims being made by the opposition; where we have dealt with independent expert advice on asylum seeker and refugee claims, which the opposition refuses to countenance and refuses to listen to.                  So I suggest to the Leader of the National Party: (1) our nation is served well by our security agencies, (2) in relation to this particular matter, the person in question was always in detention and (3) I believe that it is appropriate for the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to look at the matter, and that is why I have asked her to do so.

  I thank the member for Dobell for his question. I understand he is seriously concerned about this matter. He has raised it in the parliament on an earlier occasion. Of course there is nothing more important to a community than water supply and water security. Water is life; we all know that. I know that the community on the Central Coast is concerned about water supply and water security. We want to make sure we are responding to those concerns by getting the balance right as there is mining development - that is, for any mining development we need to properly weigh up the factors about that mine and its environmental impacts, including the potential impacts on water, which is why the approach that the government has taken is to amend the relevant legislation so that issues about water can trigger an assessment by the federal minister for the environment.                 We have also very much invested in scientific expertise in this area. As the national government we are the custodians of great institutions like the CSIRO. We have the ability to resource and finance scientific leadership, and we have done that in this area through the resources made available for the expert panel.                 I say to the member for Dobell that I do not agree with his private member's bill, except that it is a sincere attempt by him as local member to deal with this question on behalf of the community that he serves. But we do not think that that private member's bill is the appropriate road to go down. We think the appropriate road to go down to get this right for the community of the Central Coast and for communities around the country is what we are intending to do through federal government environmental law.

  I thank the member for Parramatta for that question. Yesterday's national accounts data demonstrated the underlying resilience of the Australian economy. We face global uncertainty, and our economy is making some very big transitions at home.                 In particular, the resource sector is transitioning from unprecedented growth and investment towards growth in production and exports. More broadly, we are making the transition to non-mining sources of growth. We can see this in the accounts yesterday - 0.6 per cent in the quarter; 2.5 per cent through the year; faster than every major advanced economy. We have mining investment close to its peak, while private business investment is at 50-year highs. This investment is generating strong growth - export volumes up 13.2 per cent over the year - and we have record low interest rates, supporting solid consumption and, particularly, a recovery in housing construction.                 But, as we know, this transition is not seamless. We have an economy which is 14 per cent larger than it was at the end of 2007, and that is because we got the big economic calls right. And we have got the big economic calls right again in this budget, where we are putting jobs and growth first and a slower transition in our economy back to surplus. So we support jobs and growth because we understand the importance of jobs and growth.                 In the face of that story, what do we get? We get the opposition, day in and day out, trash-talking our economy: Senator Cormann up there in the Senate this morning, the shadow Treasurer almost every day and the Leader of the Opposition. We have even had the absurd claims in sections of the media of a possible recession. This sort of talk is deeply irresponsible. Those who go around talking like they do, particularly the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer, are deeply irresponsible. Every time they do it they show how unqualified they are to run a $1.6 trillion economy.                 We on this side of the House understand to our bones the importance of supporting jobs and growth in an economy. We understand that. You showed how you did not understand that at the height of the global financial crisis, and you are showing it yet again. We are demonstrating it because we are also prepared to make the tough decisions to invest in the future, particularly through education. You trash-talk the economy; you waved our budget through up in the Federation Chamber this morning, then you go out in public and trash-talk the economy every day of the week. That shows how deeply irresponsible you are, and your approach if you were elected would be to cut education and health to the bone. That is what you are not prepared to tell the truth about to the Australian people.

  I thank the member for Shortland for her question. I know how important it is to her that schools and students in her electorate are well supported.                 The commitment from the government to education has been on full display in these last two weeks in parliament. Last week we released analysis of how the National Plan for School Improvement - described as a game changer by Indigenous academic Marcia Langton, whom many people here will know - will be transformative for Indigenous students in this country. We know how the national plan will deliver investment in schools across the regions, reinforced so clearly when the New South Wales education minister came into the parliament to brief National Party colleagues, in his words, that the Gonski reforms are 'a deal too good to ignore'. We have also announced additional support for special schools over the next six years, and yesterday we had a signally important moment when the House of Representatives and the parliament considered and enshrined a fairer, needs based funding system in legislation, in the Australian Education Bill, which passed through this House.                 Incidentally, it passed through this House without amendment, so it has been a proud record for the government - not such a good record for the shadow minister, who is on the record as wanting to sack one in seven teachers, who could not convince the parliament to oppose this bill and who ended up at the dispatch box ranting and raving whilst in the meantime we had over 5,000 primary school leaders rejecting unequivocally the position put by the opposition in relation to us implementing a new fairer funding model.                 The only person I can think of who has had a worse two weeks in education than the member for Sturt is the Queensland Premier. The Queensland Premier went on Sky talking about alleged secret meetings that were held by officials - I don't know - but forgot to mention that Commonwealth officials have met with Queensland officials 56 times, and not a single one of those meetings was a secret meeting; I have to break it to those opposite. Today we read that Premier Newman is preparing a list to sell off schools in his state. We already know that they have cut education in the state. Finally, he capped off his week by taking the ridiculous step of writing to Queensland senators, saying, 'Vote against the billions of dollars that would go to investment in Queensland schools.' He asked them to vote against the reforms that will improve the results of Queensland students, to vote against the most marginalised students in his state receiving the support that we would be providing, with him, if they signed up to the National Plan for School Improvement.                 The Queensland Premier has the power to do something positive for his state, as do other premiers. Sign up to the National Plan for School Improvement so we have better schools for all Australians.

  I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. In this year's budget, our new nation-building projects were directed towards Queensland - both Brisbane and the built-up communities and also regional Queensland. There was $718 million for the upgrade of the Gateway Motorway North, on top of the $125 million we have already put into the Gateway Motorway North project. I would have expected something in the Queensland budget, because they have had a bit to say about that project and they have had press conferences with the Leader of the Opposition. I looked for some funding in the Queensland budget and there was not one zack - nothing.                 I then looked for some funding for the Ipswich Motorway, where we have got $300 million on the table for the next section between Rocklea and Darra - building on the $2.6 billion we have already invested. We already have given Queensland $10 million to complete the business case, and that is being rolled out. So I thought, 'Where will the money be?' Well, they did a bit better. We have put about $3 billion on the table for the Ipswich Motorway and they have put in $5 million - so they have done better than zero.                 Then I looked for any mention of the Bruce Highway. The Queensland government say $690 million, but $587 million is federal government money. Then I looked for the Cross River Rail project. There is $715 million from us - recommended by Infrastructure Australia. Queensland asked for that amount of money and said they would match it, but there is not a dollar. So I thought, 'Well, maybe they have some alternative plan,' and indeed they do. To quote the Brisbane Times:                 The LNP plans to do this by adapting the train signals to let trains run more frequently, by removing seats and making extra standing room, and by using station platforms more effectively.                 So I thought, 'They've probably done a bit of a study,' and indeed they have. It is the Tokyo solution - putting people on the platforms and cramming them into the trains. That is their solution.                 But I thought, 'That will only last so long,' and indeed they have got a post-2020 measure, said a spokesperson for Minister Scott Emerson. That of course is the Indian solution!                     That is the LNP vision for urban public transport in this country, supported by the Leader of the Opposition. They do not have a plan for Brisbane. They looked for best practice overseas, and that is what they came up with! They say that the federal government has no right to have any input into urban public transport -

I do not accept the premise of the question about the description of the government's conduct. I repeat, in case the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has had trouble understanding, that the individual in question has been in detention at all times -                      I repeat: the individual in question has been in detention at all times since the individual in question entered Australia - in detention.

  I thank the member for Reid for his question. He has a profound interest in making sure that all Australians get access to good and fair jobs. I can tell him that as we speak more Australians than ever in the history of the Commonwealth are at work. I can also tell him there are more Australians working full time than ever before. I can also tell him that Australians are working harder than they have been in a very, very long time. I can inform him that labour productivity has gone up not only in the last quarter or the quarter before but no less than seven times. Australians, despite some of the doom-and-gloom merchants opposite, are working hard, and there are more of them working, and one of the reasons is that we have a very good set of workplace relations laws.                 To support this proposition that Australians are doing well, I can also inform the member for Reid that, despite some of the opposition propaganda and spin, the amount of lost time in industrial action in this country for the life of Labor governments is lower than it was under the coalition when they were in power. It is not just half as low as it was; it is a third as low. I can even say that in the construction sector, much beloved of some of the opposition propagandists, industrial action in that very tough sector is also well down, with the average under a Labor government lower than it was under the conservatives.                 We are not content to rest on our laurels. We are not complacent about the 960,000 jobs. We also want to make sure that Australia has a bright future. One of the ways we are making sure Australia has a bright future is by making sure that our kids get the best chance in life. That is why all in this House should be supporting the National Plan for School Improvement. For those who would perhaps listen to the opposition catchcry that Labor somehow is off on its own in wanting to give the best chance in life for our kids in the future workforce then I would give them the evidence of Premier Barry O'Farrell. How is it that thoughtful Liberals in the state of New South Wales will pick the kids over the politics, but less thoughtful coalition members in the federal parliament will pick the politics over the kids? That is not how we train the workforce of the future. Nine in 10 of the fastest-growing sectors in the Australian economy for jobs require a post-secondary-school education. We cannot afford to betray future generations by not giving our kids the best chance in life. We also cannot afford to betray the current generation by allowing Liberal workplace relations laws to come into practice.                 If we need evidence, despite the squirming, secret, small-target plans of those opposite, let's have a look at how state Liberal governments go when they get into power. It may interest the member for Reid - in conclusion - when he talks about obstacles to good workplaces that 72 per cent of recent industrial disputes have been caused by state conservative governments, because Liberals make bad bosses.

  Once again, the Leader of the Opposition is showing a lack of understanding of national security, our security agencies and structures like the inspector-general. It is impossible for me to give a direction to the inspector-general. In answer to the shadow minister's question a little bit earlier, I explained to the Leader of the Opposition, who now is yelling abuse presumably directed at the inspector-general, that under the relevant law - that is, the law of the country, Australian law, laws that have gone through this parliament - the inspector-general is an independent statutory officeholder. The inspector-general is not subject to general direction from me or other ministers about how she carries out her powers under the act.                 What the opposition leader is asking me to do does not fit with the way in which we have set up the inspector-general. I understand that it fits in with the general Liberal Party philosophy that what you do is wander around thugging people. But we do not do that. We respect independence.                     I withdraw. What we will not do is behave inappropriately, as invited to do by the Leader of the Opposition. Can I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition, after the serial errors that he and his team have made this week about basic matters - the Leader of the Opposition not briefed during this parliament by the director-general of ASIO, the Leader of the Opposition misrepresenting the resources of ASIO, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition misrepresenting matters pivotal to our relationship with Indonesia, the shadow minister for immigration misrepresenting the powers of the joint parliamentary committee, the shadow minister for border protection unable to walk to the dispatch box and even move a simple motion, the shadow Attorney-General out breaching confidentiality requirements of ASIO briefings - after all of those errors this week -                      After that series of errors I would counsel the Leader of the Opposition to not add to that series of errors today by coming into this parliament and misrepresenting the way in which the inspector-general works. What this has shown across the course of this week is that the Leader of the Opposition can be trusted with a slogan but he cannot be trusted with national security, because you have to get to grips with the details and the Leader of the Opposition has not shown the ability to do that at any point during this parliamentary week.

  You could ask a question if you want to. You haven't yet.                     Ask me a question - I dare you: ask me a question!                     I am proud of our investments in Queensland health. The 2013-14 budget showed continued investment: $13.2 billion extra going into the Queensland health system. It is extra money into not just the system but also the buildings. We have $100 million in the member for Moreton's own electorate at the QEII hospital to redevelop the emergency department and for new palliative care beds and a brand-new endoscopy unit. There is $400 million for Townsville Base Hospital and $220 million for Logan Hospital. We have made a choice to invest in better health services for Queenslanders.                 But there is a very stark contrast. Campbell Newman's first budget cut $3 billion from the Queensland health system and sacked more than 4,000 Queensland health workers. Queenslanders were hoping for a bit of relief this time around. They were thinking that maybe the Queensland government realised that it had cut too deeply last time and it would reverse some of those cuts. But there was no such luck. Unfortunately, I have to tell you that an extra $241 million was required to invest in hospitals just to stay still - not to go backwards - just because of population growth and inflation. That has fallen short by $137 million.                 That means the equivalent of 6½ thousand hip operations that will not get done, or 7,000 knee operations that will not get done. I will tell you that on top of that, when you look at page 21 of the Queensland budget papers, it shows that on top of those fewer operations there will be 70,000 fewer outpatient services in Queensland hospitals this year - 70,000 fewer outpatient services in Queensland hospitals. I table the budget documents that show that.                 In this press release here, they promised to do 40,000 more outpatient services; in fact they will do 70,000 fewer, and I table that press release. Patients will miss out on palliative care, they will miss out on pain management and they will miss out on the specialist clinics that are held in hospitals for outpatients.                 And, when it comes to local hospital districts, $36½ million is out of the member for Dickson's own local hospital district. Is he going to protest that? Is he going to complain? Is he going to stick up for his residents, or is he going to sit there silent, like he has done for years now? And, not just in Metro North but in Wide Bay and right across Queensland, the Sunshine Coast and the south-east coast, this is just the curtain-raiser to Tony Abbott's cuts. The Leader of the Opposition cut hospital funding last time he had the chance and he would do it again.

  I thank the member for Bass for his question. This government stands up for hardworking Australian families and small businesses. That is why we have been delivering real tax reform - reforms like tripling the tax-free threshold and cutting taxes on superannuation for our lowest-paid workers, and standing up for Australian businesses by making sure that multinational corporations pay their fair share.                 Meanwhile, each of these policies has been opposed by those opposite. But that should not surprise us because, when it comes to tax reform and the coalition, all roads lead to one place and that is the GST. We know that they want to increase the GST, which will smash families, it will smash pensioners and it will strangle small businesses with red tape.                 I revealed yesterday that the Liberal candidate for Pearce, the former WA Treasurer, was out there yesterday saying that he wanted the Liberals to jack up the GST. But that is not all he said. He also said that he wanted to see the Liberals 'sort out the distribution of GST'. We all know what that means. That means more money for his state but by ripping hundreds of millions of dollars away from states like Tasmania. The member for Bass asked the question, and $600 million would be ripped away from Tasmania if the Leader of the Opposition gets his way in moving towards something that resembles a per capita funding arrangement for GST.                 He said that on Sky about a year ago. But I note that, when he went down to Tasmania recently, he got up there in a press conference with some of his Liberal candidates there - there he was with his little pamphlet under his chin, as he does - and he said, 'Don't worry, because we can't do anything unless we have the unanimous support of the states.' Well, that is not true; it is not true at all. And even one of his own members of his team, the Liberal Senator for Tasmania, Senator Bushby, confirmed this yesterday in a press release, where he said:                 _ the final decision on relativities is indeed a decision of the Federal Treasurer of the day _                 Tasmanians have nothing to worry about while ever we are in government, but they do have a lot to be concerned about if those opposite ever get into office.                 The Leader of the Opposition and Senator Bushby are out there and they are saying, 'When it comes to the GST, trust us.' Well, when a Liberal asks you to trust them on the GST, they might as well tell you, 'Never, ever,' because they cannot be trusted. When it comes to the GST, they want to increase the GST; it is in their DNA. They introduced it; they want to jack it up -                      The choice for the Australian people is a government that will stand up for a fair share for all states or an opposition that wants to rip money away from states like Tasmania.

  What we are seeing today - and I think this question has absolutely crystallised it - is that the opposition have been, over several days, trying to raise fear in the community. They have gone on and on and on, and now, of course, their source for questions in question time in the Australian parliament is a newspaper clipping from an anonymous source. They have no ability to check the veracity of what is claimed. Presumably the next question will come from trawling the outer reaches of the internet and finding what kooks and cranks on the outer reaches of the internet have got to say. They will rush in here and present that as something worth hearing about on national security. Doesn't that just go to the difference between being a responsible government and being an opposition driven by slogan and spin. To the shadow minister -                      The Leader of the Opposition is laughing now. Here is his big attack on national security - 'Oh, it's so hard-hitting!' He's such a serious man! He's prime ministerial material! And in the middle of a question time on national security he is laughing. It is just a game to you, isn't it? Your demeanour shows it. The fact that you are laughing shows it. The fact that the shadow minister who asked the question is spending the answer looking up at the press gallery and laughing shows it. The chatter across the opposition shows it. It has been a game all week, and in this question it is transparently a game. You have come into this parliament suggesting something is worthy of inquiry and report when you have got absolutely no knowledge of its truthfulness.                 To the shadow minister: if he genuinely thinks this is worth the time of the inspector general then he should submit it to her. When he does that he should say to her: 'I know nothing about it. I read it in the newspaper. I don't know who the source of the complaint is. I've got absolutely no knowledge about it. I've got no concern about it. But I played a little question time stunt with it, so I'm forwarding it through.' That is the degree of concern of the opposition about national security matters. Gee, at the end of the week it's pretty embarrassing for the opposition it's come to this!

  I thank the member for Corangamite for his question, because climate change is about our responsibility to future generations. This government accepts that responsibility. We must cut carbon pollution to protect the environment for future generations at the same time as we continue to grow our economy, because reducing the emissions of the economy is the key to future competitiveness.                 Since the carbon price began on 1 July last year, it is important to note the facts. More than 150,000 new jobs have been created at the same time as the economy has grown at an annualised rate of 2.5 per cent. Interest rates are low, inflation is contained and unemployment is at one of the lowest rates amongst the advanced economies. These are important facts in this debate. At the same time, since carbon pricing commenced, renewable energy generation is up 30 per cent and the most emissions-intensive coal fired power stations' emissions are down 14 per cent. Emissions in the National Electricity Market in particular have fallen by almost 12 million tonnes as the energy we are using is becoming cleaner.                 This is the effect of carbon pricing, and right around the country businesses are making the changes that reduce pollution and make them more competitive over time. Farmers and meat processors are capturing their methane and turning it into electricity. Sugar mills are recycling their sugarcane waste to power their operations and selling electricity into the grid. Landfills are captur­ing methane, converting it into electricity and selling electricity into local communi­ties. The government took the responsible course of action in tackling this issue.                 In contrast, of course, the coalition and the Leader of the Opposition have travelled around the country making the most irresponsible, deceitful and mendacious claims; threatening people over their jobs; causing fear for their job security; telling communities their entire town will be wiped out and their industries will be destroyed; and, worst of all - most irresponsible of all - frightening people on low incomes like pensioners around the country that they would not be able to afford their grocery bills once the carbon price commenced. Demonstrably false. Never ever offering any credible alternative policy - just a mendacious scare campaign. And, as the mendacity went up and up and up, it has cleaned out its credibility big time. You will be called out for it.

  I genuinely thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question because it enables me to explain to him something that I explained to the Australian nation last year - that is, what are the real drivers of cost in electricity, including the extraordinary levels of investment we have seen in the poles and wires; including the market incentives that there are in the current system for the so-called gold-plating of the system that then feeds through to the prices that families and businesses pay.                 Of course, we got the facts out on the table - and I know the facts are something the Leader of the Opposition never likes to hear about because they disturb his world outlook, but facts are facts and they deserve paying regard to. The facts of this, of course, were that well before our nation priced carbon, consumers had had to tolerate increases of more than 50 per cent in their electricity prices because of these other drivers of costs. So we have moved to address those other drivers of costs through a comprehensive reform process we engaged in through the Council of Australian Governments in the last six months of last year, and we did secure agreement at the COAG meeting at the end of last year to regulatory and other changes to put downward pressure on electricity pricing.                 But of course the Leader of the Opposition does not want to refer to any of that because he does not want Australian families to know the truth about what is driving electricity prices, but that is the truth. And the Leader of the Opposition spent many weeks at the time of the greatest heat in that debate effectively defending Liberal state governments and saying on that area, which would make a real difference to the cost-of-living pressures experienced by households, that he would do absolutely nothing. On carbon pricing, as the Leader of the Opposition well knows, carbon pricing is working to reduce carbon pollution, it is working with our renewable energy target to reduce carbon pollution, and households have been assisted with the price rise that they saw in electricity, which was exactly as we predicted. None of the Leader of the Opposition's fear mongering in any of that came true.                 So to the Leader of the Opposition, the questions are simple. Why does he want our nation to reduce carbon pollution in a more expensive way? Why doesn't he join with the government in effectively working to put downward pressure on electricity prices through the COAG reform agenda? And why is he insisting on doing things like ripping money out of the hands of families through ripping away basic benefits like the Schoolkids Bonus? That is what the Leader of the Opposition should answer.

  I thank the member for Greenway for her question. I thank her for her passion for improving schooling in her electorate, because she recognises, like I do, that the future of this country is being made in Australian classrooms today and that we cannot be the strong, smart, fair nation we want to be in the future unless our children get a world-class education.                 Information is important to getting a world-class education. When this government was first elected and I first became Minister for Education no-one could tell you how children were going at school around the nation and no-one could tell you which were the 1,000 most disadvantaged schools in the country. No-one could tell you any of that information - no-one had bothered to find out. Well, find out we did and we put it on the MySchool website and now you can see on the MySchool website not only the results of literacy and numeracy testing over four years but three years of financial information. Why did we do that? We wanted parents to know. Why did we do that? We wanted the nation to know. We also did that because we then wanted to work in national partnership schools and prove that extra resources combined with new ways of working mean children get a better education. And we have proved that. In our national partnership schools 71 per cent reduced the number of students who were below minimum standards in year 3 reading and 70 per cent reduced the number of students below minimum standards in year 5 numeracy. Put simply, the kids in those schools in those classrooms have got a better education.                 Now we want to lock this in for 9,500 schools not just for today but for generations and generations to come - for the nation to be able to say to itself that the broken funding model of the former Howard government is gone and that we are funding our teachers, classrooms and children right for generations to come. That is why I am determined that around the country we see every school included in the benefits of our school funding reforms, that we see every child in every school get the benefits of our National Plan for School Improvement. I do not want to see any child left behind. That is why we will be spending the days between now and 30 June calling on premiers and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory and working with them to make sure that they put their children first and put the politics second. Australia's children deserve a world-class education and I am absolutely determined that they get one.

  To the Leader of The Nationals: it feels like they have brought in the question time pack from last June when they were in the throes of the most ridiculous fear campaign we have seen in Australian politics. Here we go again trotting out the false claims, trotting out the ridiculous assertions, trotting out the most mendacious -                      I certainly will not be taking any lectures about facts and carbon pricing from the opposition after the ridiculous fear campaign they have run around the country. What the Leader of The Nationals should know from our carbon-pricing scheme - it was made very clear at the time - is that we did not put a carbon price on petrol, diesel and LPG for passenger motor vehicles and for light on-road commercial vehicles. It has always been the subject of the scheme that, from 1 July 2014, there would be carbon pricing for heavy on-road vehicles, and that is of course because we wanted to see a situation of consistent treatment for modes of transport. Why did we want to do that?                      The Manager of Opposition Business is calling away. He might learn something. We believe climate change is real: fact No. 1. That is why we wanted to do it. Fact No. 2: we believe it is caused by human activity. Fact No. 3: we believe that we should get our economy ready for the future and reduce the carbon pollution generated by our economy. We looked around the world and saw other nations doing precisely that. Then of course is the fact that the Leader of the Opposition always finds the most deeply uncomfortable: the cheapest way of reducing the amount of carbon pollution that your economy generates is to put a price on carbon. Leading conservatives around the world know that. Former Prime Minister Howard knew that. The Leader of the Opposition sat in a cabinet that knew that, because they went to the 2007 election saying that they would bring a price on carbon pollution, an emissions-trading scheme, to Australia.                  None of those facts have changed. What has changed is that the Leader of the Opposition decided to ditch the facts and play the politics. On this side of the parliament we have always believed in those facts. We have always believed that the most effective way of reducing carbon pollution and the cheapest way of reducing carbon was to put a price on carbon. The Leader of the Opposition will never be able to say to the Australian people that he stands for a cheaper plan than ours. He does not, and that is why we will defend this plan up to and including at the next election and in the days beyond, because it is right for the country.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. It is a very good one for the state of Victoria because we have published new information, for parents and teachers in Victoria to absorb, about what our plan for school improvement means for Victorian schools. But in summary - and I know that the member for Deakin cares passionately about this - what it means is an increase in resources for Victorian schools of more than $4 billion. What that means, on average, for schools is an increase of $1.8 million. What that money will go to is lifting the standards of education of our children - things that make a real difference to children's education: the children that need help with reading and maths getting the help they need through intensive teaching and more teaching time; the kids who are galloping ahead in front of the class, at risk of being bored, given personalised learning plans that continue to extend them; specialised teachers that can make a difference in schools; language teachers; teacher librarians; and student support officers who can help with welfare in schools. We know these things work because we have proven that they work in national partnerships schools around the country.                 Recently, I was in the electorate of Deakin. In fact, we conducted a community cabinet at Norwood Secondary College. Norwood Secondary College and its 1,000 students, on our best understanding of the figures, stands to gain around $5.8 million over the next six years under Labor's new funding plan. That is a funding increase of over 50 per cent per student by 2019. Now, I do not want to see Norwood miss out on those new resources. I do not want to see Victorian schools miss out on those new resources. I do not want to see students on one side of the New South Wales/Victorian border miss out. I do not want to see schools on one side of the South Australian/Victorian border miss out. I do not want to see Victorian students left behind, which is why it is so important that the Premier of Victoria seize this once-in-a-generation opportunity to make sure that funding is right for Victorian schools. He should not succumb to the pressure from the opposition to play their politics. He should put the children of Victoria first and sign on to our plan for school improvement. Victorian children deserve it. They should have a world-class education and it is time for the Premier of Victoria to sign on to our plan and put his kids first.

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question and I am very happy to go through it. On the question of tax, on this side of the parliament we stand for lower company taxation than those on that side of the parliament - ask the BCA for a critique of the Leader of the Opposition's plan to jack up company taxes. On regulation, we have worked hard to create a seamless national economy to reduce the burden of regulation for Australian businesses. We have had many successes, but of course there have been times when state Liberal governments, presumably at the political direction of the opposition, have refused to endorse that deregulation agenda because they would prefer to play the politics.                 Then on productivity, I refer the shadow Treasurer to the facts. I know that the facts and the opposition just do not go together - they are like oil and water; they can never mix. The shadow Treasurer can never focus on a fact - he has caught that from the Leader of the Opposition. But the facts are: productivity has been increasing - I refer him to the figures in recent quarters - and that is very important. Of course, what I have been speaking about in the parliament today - our agenda for human capital, our agenda for school improvement - is absolutely about the future productivity of our nation, as are our record investments in apprenticeships and traineeships, our record investments in universities in research and the training of undergraduates, our record investments in innovation. These are all about increasing productivity for the future.                 Then the shadow Treasurer asked about infrastructure. The shadow Treasurer might want to sit at a desk quietly for an hour and have a look at this government's infrastructure improvement record, compared with the record of the government of which he was a cabinet member. He might want to do that, because this government has invested in infrastructure at record rates. We actually believe in productivity improvements through infrastructure - things like the National Broadband Network, bringing fibre to the premises; things like major public transport initiatives in our big cities, so people can get to work more easily. All of this is productivity-enhancing.                 Then the shadow Treasurer referred to costs of doing business. Let me assure the shadow Treasurer - I presume in his mouth that is code for cutting wages and conditions; after all, he was Mr Work Choices - that on this side of the parliament, we will never do that. We do not believe that our future lies in a low road of cutting wages. We believe it lies in a high road of increasing productivity, and that is what we are investing to do. No amount of giggling by the shadow Treasurer changes those facts.

  I thank the member for Fisher for his question. I remind the House what this question is about. It is about whether or not the Defence Force Retirement Benefit Scheme, which closed in September 1972, and the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme, which closed in September 1991, are appropriately indexed. They are indexed to the CPI. This matter was reviewed by Matthews in 2008. He came to the view that it was an appropriate method of indexation. Nevertheless, there is an issue which has been created in the community by some people within the ex-service organisations trying to conflate the issue of fair indexation, as you describe it, with indexation of age pensions and other income support payments.                 It is very, very clear - and we need to comprehend this - that military superannuation retirement pay provides a lifetime guaranteed level of income and indexation, regardless of the person's other income or assets, and is not affected by investment returns. The bulk of the people who have retired after 20 years of service, which they are entitled to do under the schemes, are able to take lump sum payments and in excess of 99 per cent did. It is a good scheme. The benefits after 20 years of service commit up to five times the annual superannuation retirement pay for a lump sum in exchange for a reduction in the annual payment. They give a higher percentage of final salary compared to other Commonwealth schemes and have a government employer contribution of around 30 per cent compared to the current national standard of nine per cent increasing to 12 per cent.                 This is not and cannot be compared to an income support payment. It is not. Unfortunately, the discussion going on in the community - promoted, I might say, by the opposition - is that somehow or another if you do not index the DFRB and DFRDB payments to the same level as age pensions then you are being unfair. I am very conscious of the issues that have been raised in the electorate. We are continuing to work on the issue. You are right that the department of finance is looking into the issues. We expect we will have more to say in the very near future.                 Let me finish with the words of the former coalition minister for finance, who confirmed this last year, when he said:                 This particular claim was properly rejected by the Howard Government, of which I was a member _ there is no inherent logic.                     There is no inherent logic to the proposition that a public sector employment related superannuation payment should be indexed in exactly the same fashion as a means-tested welfare benefit, in this case the aged pension.

  I thank the member for Moreton for his question and thank him for his passion and interest in education. He is a former teacher and brings to this parliament a real understanding about what it is like to improve the lives of children and to enable them to get a great education.                 He asked me what Queensland schools can lose because Premier Newman to date has refused to sign on to our plan for better schools to improve Queensland schools and to bring them new funding. I can advise the member for Moreton, and I can advise the House, that what is being put at risk by the behaviour of Premier Newman is an increase in funding for Queensland schools of $3.8 billion. On average, that is $2.2 million per school. That is a lot of new resources to improve the education of Queensland children.                 I will take just one example of what this can mean for a school. This is, of course, a system of funding designed to bring schools around the country up to a school resource standard, with particular loadings for the kinds of kids who are in that school; and so more resources if children are from a disadvantaged background or are Indigenous kids.                 If we take the example of Corinda State High School. I met the principal there at community cabinet. Indeed, I understand that the member for Moreton was a teacher with that principal. For that school, the increase in funding would be $13 million. That is a very sizeable increase for those children for that school community.                 Those are 13 million reasons why Premier Newman should sign on to our plan. But in fact there are 3.8 billion reasons why Premier Newman should sign on to our plan. I want to assure the House that those resources will be put into the kind of work we know improves children's education. We know it, because we have proved it in national partnership schools.                 None of this has been done quickly. First, we got the evidence and we exposed it to everyone in the nation through MySchool. Then we started the national curriculum development and rolled it out. Then, of course, we improved school buildings and school equipment. Then we showed in our national partnership schools how you can lift standards, joining new resources with very practical changes in classrooms that make a difference for children. It is that plan that we now want to take around the nation to give our children a world-class education.                 Premier Newman should not stand between the children of Queensland and a world-class education, and the Leader of the Opposition should not oppose a world-class education for our nation's children.

  I thank the shadow minister for that question, because the one thing that everyone on this side of the House is proudest of is the creation of almost one million jobs - one million jobs! - in the time that we have been in power. I do want to make a couple of points about this, because almost one million jobs have been achieved during one of the most difficult times in the global economy in over 80 years.                 Of course, we saw the shadow Treasurer last week when the unemployment figures came out - the labour force was published - and unemployment was at 5.5 per cent. In the context of almost one million jobs being created since we came to power, he described that outcome as 'mediocre'. Well, you would have to be a bonehead to make that sort of statement - a complete bonehead to claim -                      I do withdraw, Speaker. But this trash-talking of the Australian economy from the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer, the shadow minister over there and the rest of the backbench should stop. It should stop because it is deeply, deeply irresponsible and it does not reflect the underlying strength of the Australian economy.                 But they go out and do it day in, day out. They talk down the economy. They go out there and exaggerate debt; they go out there and try to cause all sorts of challenges and to take up and use all of the worst rhetoric you could possibly pass on in the face of those sorts of outcomes which everyone on this side of the House is very, very proud of. For Australia to have achieved one million jobs in an environment where jobs have been lost in their millions across the United States and right across Europe - this is something that everyone on this side of the House is extremely proud of. But you get this deeply irresponsible approach from those opposite.                 And why do they talk down our economy? They talk down our economy, because they use that as the Trojan Horse to justify the savage cuts to the bone that they are planning to put into our economy. But they will not tell the Australian people about what they intend to do. We had the Leader of the Opposition the other day talking about the need for paying for cuts but we have not heard any of the detail. We had the shadow Treasurer the other day refusing to say that they would put out costed policies. All of that is code for vicious cuts to the bone, the types of which have been put in place by Campbell Newman in Queensland, because they too, like Campbell Newman, have got a commission on cuts planned.                     I was asked about jobs, Speaker. In Queensland, Campbell Newman, slashed 14,000 jobs following his commission of cuts; not something he told the people of Queensland about before the election in Queensland. We, on this side of the House, stand for jobs and growth. It went to the core of our budget because we believe in our bones that we have to do everything that we can to secure employment and promote growth and provide for the security of the Australian people.

  I thank the member for Capricornia for that question, because over the past five years our economy has emerged as one of the strongest developed economies within the global economy. All of this has been achieved in the middle of extraordinary uncertainty: the global financial crisis and all of its aftershocks. You only have to look to Europe and what has occurred there in the last couple of months. We have achieved something very special in this area for Australia. It has been done by choice and not by chance because, if those people opposite would have had their way, they would not have moved to support the economy as we did during the global financial crisis. Because of the actions that we took, we supported employment and we avoided the skill destruction, the capital destruction and the destruction of communities that come from high levels of unemployment and the destruction that it causes to small business. All of that was avoided in this country, giving us the strength to invest for the future to make sure we get the prosperity of tomorrow.                 Let us just look at some of the facts: our economy is 14 per cent larger than it was at the end of 2007. If those people opposite had had their way this economy would have experienced a recession. In our economy there have been almost one million jobs created over the past five years. We have an unemployment rate of 5.5 per cent, one of the lowest in the developed world, and particularly when you look to Europe where the rate is 12.2 per cent. We have strong public finances. We have a AAA credit rating from the three major global rating agencies with a stable outlook - something never achieved by that mob in 12 years - and of course we have low levels of debt.                  All of these things say that our economy is in good nick. But what we have to do is to make the investments for the future; make the smart investments for the future. That is why we found the savings in our budget to make the investments in education, investments that the Prime Minister has been talking about today. We understand that the future of productivity growth in this economy is dependent upon the investments we make in the quality of our education today and over the next decade. And that is precisely what we are doing; precisely why we are investing in schools, in New South Wales with a Liberal premier and investing in South Australia.                  We hope to invest right across our country, but what we have seen here is just how negative the Liberals are when it comes to this fundamental investment in the future of our country. Playing politics with the education of our kids, and nowhere is that worse than in my state of Queensland which badly needs the additional money. The additional $3.8 billion to lift the educational standards in our state. Last week, we saw the Benny Hill routine of the Premier of Queensland in and out of state schools, unable to explain why he is being so difficult and negative when the truth is that he and the Leader of the Opposition are in lock step because they do not believe in investing in our schools.                 We on this side of the House are up for the future investments which will provide for future prosperity.

  I thank the member for Goldstein for his question. It enables me to get some of the facts on the table. Once again I understand that the opposition is going to start interjecting once the word 'facts' is said because they cannot stand facts, cannot deal with them, because of course they always stand in the way of the fear campaign that the member for Goldstein is trying to run at the instruction of the Leader of the Opposition. I would refer him to the following facts: the Clean Energy Finance Corporation was established almost a year ago and it is now carrying out its legislative mandate to look at clean energy proposals which it can begin to invest in from 1 July.                 When you look at who is making the decisions at the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, of course, you see people with extensive business experience. In raising these criticisms, the member for Goldstein is effectively insulting them. There has been a resounding positive response to date from the market, demonstrating the positive role that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation can play in providing finance for the clean-energy sector.                 Indeed, it is recognised by countries overseas as an example of a good way to cartelise clean technology investment. We understand that on that side of politics, amongst their very many plans for wrecking the Australian economy, what they want to introduce into our national economic debate is sovereign risk. What they want to say to responsible business people -                      Thank you very much. I am asked about what is proper and what is not proper. What is not proper is introducing sovereign risk into our national economic conversation, which is exactly what the Leader of the Opposition and his team are endeavouring to do. We have the Clean Energy Finance Corporation working in accordance with Australian law, making responsible arrangements as a finance corporation guided by leading Australian business people. And to that the Leader of the Opposition says: 'Too bad! If I'm ever Prime Minister then I will trash those arrangements, I will hurt private businesses, I will trash our nation's global economic reputation.' The Leader of the Opposition says he will introduce into our global reputation this element of sovereign risk. Well, it is only one way in which the Leader of the Opposition would hurt the Australian economy, hurt jobs and hurt families. I thank the member for Goldstein for asking this question because this should be the focus of public engagement and public debate: the Leader of the Opposition's plan to trash Australia's reputation as a place to invest, ultimately meaning fewer jobs, less prosperity, less opportunity for Australians and their families.

  I thank the member for his question. In his electorate of Makin alone we have seen over $108 million invested in improving school facilities. We have got trades training centres, some seven of which are in his electorate, and he will have seen the additional investment and support that this Labor government provides across the country but particularly in South Australia. So I welcome the question.                 We do not want to see any young Australian child left behind at school and now the National Plan for School Improvement is being accepted by premiers around Australia. New South Wales has signed, the Australian Capital Territory has signed, the Australian Education Bill has passed the House, and South Australia has also now signed the National Education Reform Agreement. This plan now covers over 60 per cent of students in our schools. It is about delivering reform which makes a difference, improving teacher quality, making sure that the implementation of the Australian curriculum is accessible to all students and empowering school leadership, particularly principals, who know how their schools should be organised and the resources used as well.                 This is an important agreement for South Australia because it will see an additional $656 million in base funding and, when you add the certainty of indexation which we are providing, a total injection of over $1 billion - in fact, $1.1 billion - extra into schools in South Australia. That will be especially important in supporting regional and disadvantaged schools. This is about making sure that South Australian schools can move into the top five of school systems in the world as well. It is also about making sure that kids in South Australia reach their full potential. I think that is why the Premier, Jay Weatherill, said:                 This will, in the long term, make an extraordinary difference to the future prosperity of South Australia and the wellbeing of its citizens.                 I agree with the Premier.                  I am asked about obstacles. The fact is that the obstacles to us delivering a fairer funding system with more resources to students around Australia lie with the opposition here in the House of Representatives. It is the member for Sturt, who is the shadow minister, and the Leader of the Opposition who are trying to destroy and frustrate these important education reforms. The fact is now that it is up to the Victorian Premier to stand up for the students in his state and recognise -                      I am happy to address the opposition's statements on education because the member for Sturt is on record as wanting to sack one in seven teachers, the Leader of the Opposition thinks that supporting government schools is an injustice and now they are trying to block $1.1 billion of extra support for students in South Australia. That is what this debate is all about: those opposite -

  I do genuinely thank the member for Sturt for his question, which may well be -                      the second question he has asked on education in this parliament - and doesn't that tell you everything about the attitude of the opposition. When they were in government they never did anything for Australia's children; never did one thing that has endured for the long term. When we came to government what we inherited was a system where no-one knew what was happening in Australian schools. No-one knew where the most disadvantaged schools were. No-one knew and no-one cared.                     When we came to government there was not a list of the most disadvantaged schools in this country because no-one knew, no-one cared and no-one had bothered to ask. It is this government that has changed the information available on Australian schools because we wanted to know, we desperately cared and that is why we asked.                  We did not keep that information to ourselves. We put it out there on the My School website for the whole nation to judge. Then we commenced a process of investing in Australian schools, the likes of which have never been seen before in Australia's history: more investments for low-SES schools, for the schools that teach the poorest children; more investments into literacy and numeracy; more investments into teacher quality; the rollout of trades training centres, new school buildings -                      and in equipment. And now of course, there is our plan to invest more in Australian schools than has ever been invested before; a new plan for school improvement which means, compared with the broken funding model of today, a $16.2 billion difference in the contribution of the federal government.                 Now, to that, does the shadow minister for education have an alternative plan? No. To that, has the shadow minister ever articulated an agenda for reform and improvement of Australian schools of any weight or meaning? Never. Instead, what he has done is wander around peddling false figures including in the parliament today. And why is he peddling false figures? He knows that this government is passionately committed to improving the education of every Australian child.                     The shadow minister is not quoting the budget - that is the point. Why is the shadow minister out with all of these falsehoods? Well, it is part of his campaign, and the Leader of the Opposition's campaign, to put the politics first. What they do when they are not sitting in this parliament is ring up their conservative mates and say, 'Whatever you do, do not sign onto the government's plan for school education. You have got a Liberal Party ticket in your pocket: put the kids last!' That is what the Leader of the Opposition has been doing, and the shadow minister has been doing, and they should be ashamed of that conduct.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. Like all of Labor, she supports a plan for jobs and growth, as does our Fair Work Act. It is good to get a chance to talk about what the Fair Work Act is delivering in terms of helping Australian workplaces. I can report to the House that business investment in Australia is up. One in every $5 in the Australian economy is business investment. I can report to the House a 25 per cent increase in the number of new companies registered since the Fair Work Act laws have been in place.                 I can also report that, whilst the Fair Work Act laws have been in place, the ASX has climbed 17.9 per cent. Interest rates are down. There is reasonable wages growth in Australia, but it is moderate. The number of apprentices and trainees is up. The number of Australians completing higher-level qualifications is up. Indeed, unemployment is steady.                 I am also pleased to report that productivity has been up for the last nine quarters and also, despite the myth-making from the coalition, the average days lost due to industrial action under Labor is half to one third of what it was under the coalition. So I think that any reasonable objective judgement about the role of the Fair Work laws that our Prime Minister brought into place when she was the minister for employment, shows that they are working.                 But there are obstacles to this, as I have been asked by the member for La Trobe, I am afraid to say. The obstacles in fact are the coalition. Unfortunately, I have to say in putting forward this proposition that the coalition are an obstacle to better workplace laws - have a look at the voting record when they come here. Thursday a week ago, to my disappointment I might add, they voted against new laws to protect people against workplace bullying. They voted against family-friendly provisions to request leave. And to complete a trifecta, they voted against roster protection. All this comes on top of the opposition leader's proposition that he wants to introduce a great big new tax on 3½ million Australian workers where they pay tax on their superannuation contributions because they earn less than $37,000.                  Unfortunately, it is not only their voting record here; it is their actions elsewhere when they get into power. I have never seen a state coalition government who does not like to fight with their ambulance officers, with their firefighters, with their teachers or with their nurses. The coalition, whenever they get to power, are genetically disposed to attacking their own employees.                 Of course it does not just stop at their actions or their voting record. Have a look at the instructions that the coalition are receiving here in this place from elsewhere. The cat was belled again today in the pages of TheAustralian by none other than Premier Denis Napthine who basically accused the opposition of not going far enough on industrial relations. That is what you will get if the coalition is successful on 14 September: individual contracts at the heart of workplace relations under the coalition.

  To the deputy leader's question: what this government does is deal with the advice of experts and deal with the world in which we live. We do not pretend a different world exists. The Leader of the Opposition's policies and plans depend on believing a different world exists. For example, the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition have been out pretending to the Australian people that they can somehow turn boats back and get an agreement with Indonesia to do so. Well, since the parliament last sat, the falsehood of this -                      Thank you very much. To the Leader of the Opposition's point of order and the deputy leader's question: what the government does is create policies guided by the facts and guided by the experts. We have been guided by people like the former Chief of the Defence Force, Angus Houston. What we have hit in this parliament is the relentless negativity of the opposition that, in choosing between the national interest of Australia and a bit of cheap political advantage, went for the cheap political advantage and voted for more boats. Now what they are doing is peddling falsehoods out in the Australian community. Since this parliament last sat, the Vice President of Indonesia has made it absolutely clear that the false claims by the opposition to have some agreement with Indonesia that they can return boats to Indonesia are simply untrue. Then, even more recently, the former chief admiral, someone who would know something -                      I know this is uncomfortable for the opposition: a former Defence Force leader, Admiral Chris Barrie, has spoken on turning boats back and has spoken about the dangers for Defence Force personnel. So to the deputy leader's question: what she is asking me to do and asking the government to do is to pretend that you can make Indonesia do things when the statements of a sovereign nation are clear on the record. What she is asking me to do is to reject the advice of senior personnel and former personnel like Chris Barrie about the dangers to Defence Force officers in endeavouring to turn boats back. Well, that world of falsehood lies over there in the opposition. For us, what we would want to be able to do is come to this parliament and get consent from this parliament to fully implement the expert panel's recommendations. But of course the Leader of the Opposition, in the deep embrace of negativity, will continue to vote for more boats time after time after time.

  I thank the member for her question. Indeed, just last week, together we announced more than half a billion dollars for the necessary preconstruction work on the Woolgoolga to Ballina section of the Pacific Highway - just a part of our record $7.9 billion that we have committed. This section of preconstruction is fifty-fifty funded between the Commonwealth and New South Wales.                 We are also getting on with the job of upgrading the Bruce Highway, and last Wednesday I was also in Queensland. I was there to begin construction on section A of Cooroy to Curra, a vital project - $790 million shared between the Commonwealth and the state government. The Leader of the Opposition asks his deputy, the Leader of the Nationals, whether he was there. No, he was not. He did not turn up to the sod-turn at the beginning of construction, just as he did not turn up at the announcement of funding, the beginning of construction, the completing of construction or the opening of section B in his electorate. So I thought: 'Fair enough. He's probably been pretty busy working on policy.' I saw a bit of policy from those opposite on 14 June - last week. The South Coast Register had the headline 'Abbott show rolls into town'. It says - this is a direct quote:                 If we are elected we will form an organisation called Infrastructure Australia _                 Well, there's a thought! There's an idea! Why didn't we think of that? Then he went on to say this:                 _ which will do its best to rationally and scientifically look at the various infrastructure projects and rank the best on public cost benefit _                 There's another idea! Why didn't we think of that? Melbourne Metro - we did it. It is on the list. Cross River Rail - it is on the list. All 15 out of 15 projects are on the list, and we are funding them, and this bloke is telling state governments: 'No, don't accept the money. Stick with the Bombay solution on Cross River Rail of removing seats so people can stand up.'                     This quote goes on:                 _ then all levels of governments will be able to fund what they choose to be the one that makes most sense.                 So we have cost-benefit analysis. We have Infrastructure Australia. We have the system set up which doesn't say, 'We fund roads but we don't fund rail.' It says you do proper analysis and that you don't have bias according to mode. That is precisely what we have done. It is precisely the good policy structure that we have set up. This bloke has not noticed that we have been funding public transport in our capital cities and urban centres. He also has not noticed Infrastructure Australia; so, to help him, I table the national infrastructure priority list, which has on it the NBN -

  I genuinely, genuinely thank the Leader of the Opposition for this question, because, of course, the Leader of the Opposition and his team are the creators of and contributors to this national mood. They are out there with their reckless and ridiculous claims about a budget emergency. He quotes Cameron Clyne from the National Australia Bank -                      He quotes the CEO of the National Australia Bank. I suggest the Leader of the Opposition get him on the phone and ask him whether or not he would endorse the opposition's language of 'budget emergency'. Of course he would not, because responsible businesspeople know that the Leader of the Opposition and his team are seeking political advantage by talking the Australian economy down. What they seek to do every day is to pretend that the Australian economy is somehow weak, to pretend that there is somehow an unsustainable burden of debt.                  The Leader of the Opposition ought to know - though, given his lack of knowledge of economics, perhaps he does not - that, compared with countries around the world, the Australian economy is standing resilient and strong, having come through the global financial crisis by unions, businesses, this government and the Australian community working together to ensure we kept Australians in work. Having come through that global financial crisis strong, we are here today with sustainable public finances, a AAA rating by every major ratings agency for the first time in our nation's history and, despite all the ridiculous claims of the opposition, with modest debt - the equivalent of someone earning $100,000 a year having a $12,000 mortgage. We are in a position, therefore, having come through strong with strong public finances and a AAA rating, to build and invest for the future, which is precisely what this government is doing: investing in a clean energy future, which the Leader of the Opposition wants to wreck; investing in a National Broadband Network, which the Leader of the Opposition wants to wreck; investing in infrastructure, which the Leader of the Opposition wants to wreck; and, of course, he is wrecking our chances for our children to have a high-quality, world-class education so we can be a strong and prosperous nation in the future - something the Leader of the Opposition wants to wreck. National mood of gloom? Have a look in the mirror!

  I thank the member for Parramatta for that question, and I thank her for her interest in making sure that the children in her electorate get a high-quality education and a great future. I know that the member for Parramatta is very focused on that. She wants to make sure the kids of her electorate do not get left behind as the education standards of the world continue to rise.                 I can say to the member for Parramatta and to members in this place that the work we are doing on schools is a great Labor reform. It is only Labor that has ever worried about the quality of education for every child in every classroom. When we came to government, our children and our schools had had to tolerate a decade of indifference and neglect. Education was not at the forefront of Australia's public policy debate, because no-one cared. There was no information on what was happening in schools. There was no idea where disadvantaged students went to school, because no-one cared.                 Well, I care. This government cares. And that is why we have ensured that there is more information available now than ever before for Australians on the quality of education. We have made sure that we have demonstrated and proved that, no matter whether or not children come from a poor home, you can lift the quality of their education. We have made sure as we have rolled out the national curriculum that, if you and your family move from state to state, you will still be learning a high-quality national curriculum.                 Now we want to go further and make sure that, whether you are in a school in Parramatta or a school in any other part of the country, you are getting a great quality education. In New South Wales we know that not every Liberal leader needs to be a wrecker. Premier O'Farrell in his budget today has made appropriate provision to work with the federal government to lift the quality of schools in New South Wales. I do not want the kids on the other side of the border in Victoria or in Queensland to be left behind. I do not want them to be the kids without the specialist teachers, without the speech therapy, without the people focused on their literacy, without the breakfast clubs, without the homework clubs, without the school support mechanisms that engage their families in school, without the empowered school principals.                 I do not want those children left behind. That is why we, having seen Premier O'Farrell reach across the political divide and make this historic agreement, are so determined to ensure that it rolls out around the country so every child in every school gets a great education and we will not let the Leader of the Opposition stop us delivering that.

  Thank you very much, Speaker. I must thank the Leader of the National Party for his question because it enables me to restate what I said yesterday which is, of course, we want to reduce the amount of carbon pollution in our atmosphere. As I understand it, it is still bipartisan politics to see a five per cent reduction in carbon pollution. So we want to do it in the cheapest possible way. I know that the Leader of the National Party stands behind the Leader of the Opposition for doing it in a more expensive way. He wants the nation to pay more, he wants families to pay more, he wants businesses to pay more.                 Now already in question time today we have had the Leader of the Opposition refer to Cameron Clyne, the CEO of the National Australia Bank, and his words on the economy. Well, let me also refer to the words of Cameron Clyne directly on this debate. I suggest that the Leader of the National Party take these words to heart and reflect on his silly question and, more importantly, the ridiculous policy of the opposition on carbon pricing. Mr Clyne says:                 If you are asking for an economic assessment of the two the carbon price followed by an ETS is economically superior to the direct action policy.                 It will drive certainty, it will drive investment and so as a straight comparison between the two that's the choice.                  So having introduced Cameron Clyne as an economic expert into this conversation in question time today, I suggest the Leader of the Opposition -                      I was asked about carbon pricing and I am answering. Let me refer again to the words of Cameron Clyne:                 It will drive certainty, it will drive investment and so as a straight comparison between the two that's the choice.                 What that means is that the Leader of the Opposition stands for less certainty, less investment. He used the word 'gloom' today and gloom is right for his policies, absolutely.

  I very much thank the member for Moreton for that question. He has demonstrated during this week, day after day, how focused he is on the quality of education for the children in his electorate, bringing his lifetime passion for education into this parliament. Though I have never worked as a teacher, I can certainly join him in that. I want to make sure, as I have across my lifetime, that every Australian gets the transformative opportunity that comes with a great education. I want to make sure that happens for every child in every school.                 The member for Moreton represents in this parliament schools like Oxley State School, a primary school of around 500 students. That school stands to gain around $3 million in funding over the next six years, an increase of 43 per cent. What is standing between that school and those students and those new resources and our plan for school improvement to lift the standards of education for those children?                 What is standing between that school and having a more empowered school principal, who can choose teachers and the right mix of staff? What is standing between that school and a plan for school improvement where the community is involved in working out what would lift the kids up, and that is accountable and transparent on My School? What is standing between that school and the extra resources and ways of working, which will enable them to tackle very difficult problems like disadvantage, attendance and bullying? What is standing between that school and having the resources to have things like a family and community liaison officer to make sure that kids and families do not fall through the gaps and that they can build networks to ensure that those kids have strong community networks, including with local service organisations and local business?                 Well what is standing between that school and those improvements, what is standing between that school and a great quality education, is the Premier of Queensland. He is standing between his schools and $3.8 billion of new resources for the kids in Queensland. Not every Liberal leader needs to be a wrecker. Premier O'Farrell has proved that, and Premier Newman could prove that too. But instead of lifting up the phone and saying yes to me, saying that he wants to improve schools, he is too busy taking the calls of the Liberal opposition saying: 'Whatever you do, don't sign up to the government's plan. Put political advantage before the advantage of the kids in your schools.' Well Premier Newman should stop listening to the Leader of the Opposition. Put Queensland kids first - that is what we want to do.

  I do thank the member for the advertisement for my app, and I invite everybody to have a look. The one thing we do on this side of the House is deal in facts. And when events occur in the global economy, we respond. During the global financial crisis we responded. We supported jobs and growth in our economy. We were opposed tooth and nail by those opposite - indeed, the current Leader of the Opposition slept through the vital vote in the House, the one that saved Australia from recession - so everybody on this side of the House is proud of what we did to support jobs and growth in our economy. We took on a responsible level of debt to support jobs and growth.                 I welcome questions every day of the week in this House from the opposition about jobs and growth and about levels of debt because we have a responsible level of debt to support jobs and growth. The outcome of that is an economy 14 per cent larger than it was at the end of 2007. We did not, as a country, go into recession. If those on the other side of the House had had their way they would have slashed expenditure; we would have had high unemployment; we would have had higher deficits; and we would have had higher debt because there would have been enormous capital destruction, high unemployment and dislocation across all of our communities - particularly in the communities in Longman. It would have been savage if your party had their way during the global financial crisis. So we on this side of the House are proud of the fact that we put jobs and growth first.                     Speaker, we have a low and responsible level of debt that supports jobs and growth in our economy and provides job security for millions of Australians. This policy stands in stark contrast to the ones that those opposite are hiding from the Australian people. They are putting forward a proposition for a commission of cuts. They are not going to tell people before the election what they intend to do. But what they intend to do, if they are elected, is follow the example of Premier Newman - that is, take the axe to expenditure on health and education, which would have a massive impact -                      on levels of employment in our economy. We welcome a debate about debt. We welcome a debate about jobs and growth because we on this side of the House are proud of the 960,000 jobs created in Australia as a result of the actions of this government because we on this side of the House had the courage to put jobs and growth first. On that side of the House, they will cut to the bone, they will slash jobs and growth, they will slash health and education, and unemployment, deficits and debt will go through the roof.

  I thank the member for New England. Throughout the life of this parliament the member for New England, along with a number of others, has been very passionate in making sure that we take proper precautions with underground water and have a proper scientific approach to make sure that we get across the connectivity issues between different parts of underground water, and their connection to surface water as well. There are effectively three components, and bioregional assessment is one of them. The independent scientific committee that was established by this parliament and funded to the tune of $200 million deals with two different things. Firstly, it deals with providing independent advice project by project. Secondly, it is involved in providing bioregional assessments. These assessments will happen across many areas across Australia. At the moment there are the first four - in Namoi, in Gloucester, in Galilee and in Clarence - and I was meeting only this morning with the members affected as to the Clarence area, those from the north coast of New South Wales.                 Those bioregional assessments have been supported and the work of the independent scientific committee has been supported by three separate government agencies. The work is led by the Bureau of Meteorology but also supported by the CSIRO and by Geoscience Australia. Effectively, what they are doing is bringing together in a bioregional assessment a series of different compartments of information: the data that we have, modelling that is available and the proper risk assessment, as well as an impact assessment of any work. What that then means is that in the future, when different projects come forward, we have a much more fundamental understanding of the full range of connectivity issues beyond the specifics of the project that is in front of us. But to be able to take all of this into account is the final part of the three parts of the approach, and that is what was referred to in the question as a water trigger.                 We had already established all of this information, making sure it was being independently collected. The water trigger - which was before the Senate yesterday and was still before the Senate this morning, and I suspect it will continue to be before the Senate this afternoon as they are debating and working it through - effectively has one issue at its core. There is a large level of frustration that the states were not properly and fully taking all of this scientific information into account and it is to fill that gap, to make sure that there is a federal requirement. Now I have to say that the amendment that was moved by the member for New England and was supported by the government has again been challenged in the Senate. I am not sure what the point is in having a water trigger if the opposition say that you should then be able to defer it back to the states, because the whole concept of having the water trigger is that the states have not been doing their job. So to vote for a water trigger and then say we are going to give it back to the states anyway takes away what the public is demanding, that we are very careful with underground water.

 I thank the member for her question. She is a great advocate for improved educational opportunities for the people in her region. The fact is that better schools mean a better future for Australia. If we look at a young person who is highly skilled, they can earn up to 2½ times as much over their lifetime as someone who does not have high skills, and someone who finishes school in year 11 is likely to earn about 10 per cent more over their lifetime, so it makes a big difference in a school how well a young person is educated. As the Prime Minister has already referred to in the parliament, the New South Wales government has delivered its budget and it has made the necessary investment in our plan for school improvement.                 I just want to go back to what Premier O'Farrell said when they signed up, because he said it provides 'additional resources, fairer distribution to deliver higher standards and better outcomes in schools across New South Wales'. Today Minister Piccoli is saying quite clearly that New South Wales got a fantastic deal, a $5 billion deal - we contributed $1.7 billion - and they have followed it up by saying, 'We will always cooperate with the federal government to produce better outcomes for our students.' And we absolutely agree, because this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to put our students above politics and to secure our future. That is why we voted in the House for the Australian Education Bill and that is why we are asking other states to get on board with this National Plan for School Improvement.                 Now I am asked about responses and there is confusion among those opposite in terms of responses. I heard the member for Riverina lamenting the fact that in the top 50 schools in the region there is only one regional school and that is a private school and that is alarming, to say the least. Yes, it is alarming and the reason for that is that, under the new National Plan for School Improvement, regional schools would see specific loadings because they are regional schools. That may have passed by the member's notice at this point in time. Then we have got the shadow minister, the member for Sturt - he has never been interested; he never looked at the plan - dismiss the Gonski review in 20 minutes and describe our goal to have Australia's schools in the top five performing nations in education as a 'mad plan' and then he sort of said that, well, Gonski is 'conski'. Last night, I notice, the shadow minister said in the House:                 With those few words, I point out that the coalition will not oppose this bill. _ We cannot support it and we cannot oppose it _                 There you go: 'we cannot support it but we cannot oppose it'. Well, what can they do about education in our nation when we are on the cusp of the most important reform to deliver a needs based funding system to make sure that every school in Australia is a great school?

  I thank the member for Sturt for his question and I am more than happy to answer his question because the member for Sturt has been out there playing silly games with figures to try and confuse people. As to what he should be doing in this parliament, he should be referring to that section of the budget which shows increasing investment for our schools. Across six years it is $14.5 billion between state and federal governments and then, of course, there is the indexation figure and he should be looking at the note in that budget table that tells you the difference between our plan and the broken plan that the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Sturt have decided that they support. The difference between those two figures, footnoted in the budget papers, is $16.2 billion. So the member for Sturt, if he wants to come in and quote the budget papers ought to take himself to that budget paper and ought to ask why he and the Leader of the Opposition stand by a funding system that would rip Australian children off, that would rip Australian schools off and which conservatives like Premier O'Farrell and his education minister, Mr Piccoli - conservatives - have referred to as 'a broken system'.                 Why would the Leader of the Opposition and shadow minister stand behind such a broken system and a plan to rip off Australian schools? I do not think there is any mystery. These are the people who went to the 2010 election saying that they would rip more than $1 billion out of investment in trades training centres for schools and saying that they would rip almost half a billion dollars out of improving teacher quality - our national partnership to make sure that quality teachers are teaching our kids, driven by the research which shows that there is nothing more important to the outcomes of a child's education than the quality of the teacher standing in front of the classroom. The Leader of the Opposition says to that, 'Cut it by half a billion dollars.' Some $330 million of cuts for our poorest schools is what the Leader of the Opposition took to the last election, ripping off the most disadvantaged kids and disadvantaged communities.                  It goes on and on. In fact, between the last election campaign and cuts announced in February 2011, almost $3 billion of cuts to Australian schools have been announced by the Leader of the Opposition. He and his shadow minister are not done yet. That is just a curtain-raiser for the amount of hurt and harm they want to do to Australian schools and the prospects of our children getting a great quality education. That is who they are. That is what they stand for.

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for that question because Australia has a world-beating combination of economic strengths. Everybody on this side of the House is very proud of Australia's achievements over the past five years - solid growth. We are 14 per cent larger than we were at the end of 2007. We have low unemployment and nearly one million jobs have been created in our time in office. We also have low and responsible levels of debt, which are in fact a very important buffer against global uncertainty. And of course, as the Prime Minister said before, we have the AAA credit rating from the three major global rating agencies, with a stable outlook, and that is not something that occurred at any stage in the 12 years that those opposite were in power. We have got to this point because, at every stage over those five years, we have put jobs and growth first. We have got the big economic decisions right, and the consequence of that is that strong set of economic outcomes, which are providing resilience in the Australian economy.                 For those that want to talk our economy down, it is worthwhile looking at the Reserve Bank minutes that have been published today, because they still point to modest growth in non-mining investment. Of course, we know - and we see this again in the Reserve Bank board minutes today - that mining investment will stay at very high levels for some time to come. They also point to the strong growth in commodity exports, which is also important, and they also point to historic low interest rates and the stimulus that that is providing, particularly to the housing sector.                 But you never see that acknowledged by those opposite, who come into this House day after day and trash-talk our economy. It is deeply, deeply irresponsible, because we have an economy which is in transition: in transition from mining sources of growth to non-mining sources of growth and in transition from mining investment to mining production. In the middle of that, we have continuing global uncertainty. That is why it is so important to continue to get the big calls right, as we have done in terms of our fiscal policy: slowing down the return to surplus to support jobs and growth; giving the Reserve Bank maximum room to adjust monetary policy, which they are doing; and making the big investments for the future - the big investments that make our economy stronger by investing in education, smart investments that build stronger communities. That is what this government is all about. We understand that tomorrow's prosperity is built today, and investing in education is the most fundamental thing that you can do to lift productivity in your economy for the longer term, which is why it is so tragic to see those on the other side of the House side with the conservative premiers to oppose the school improvement program. Nothing - nothing - could be more important to the long-term economic and social interests of this country than investment in education, and those opposite, in opposing these reforms, show how unqualified they are for high office.

  I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. It is absolutely no wonder that the opposition has moved off questioning about schools. But to the member for Wentworth's question on broadband: let me assure him that what the Australian people know from this government is that we will ensure that fibre gets to the premises - that is, we will do it once and do it right for Australia's future. Not for us the member for Wentworth's 'fraudband' policy, which of course would cost a lot of money and deliver very slow access, relying as it does on the copper network, which is decades and decades and decades old.                     I would refer the member for Wentworth to the question he asked, which had a very all-embracing second sentence. Let me answer it given that he has asked it. The member for Wentworth has asked in the most general terms about whether or not people can rely on this government -                      Thank you very much. The member for Wentworth has raised in the broadest possible terms the future of our nation in telecommunications and who can be relied on to deliver that future. I can answer the member for Wentworth very clearly: the Australian people can rely on this government to ensure that they get the telecommunications our nation needs for our nation's future. That is because we are pursuing a real plan to make sure that people get the ability to move information around in the modern age that the modern economy requires. We are doing that and we will continue to do that. I am amazed that the member for Wentworth, of all people, would come into this parliament with a question like this. His deep discomfort with the opposition's 'fraudband' plan was on display the very day he announced it - adding, of course, to his deep discomfort with the Leader of the Opposition's so-called direct action policy. Well, let me assure the member for Wentworth of this: this is a government focused on the future, the NBN, the clean -                      As I was saying in answer to the very general question I was asked, Australians can rely on this government to invest in the future. Whether it is the National Broadband Network, wireless technologies, a clean energy future, the future of Australian schools, or roads, rail and ports, we are the government determined to build the nation, whilst you pursue your plans for wrecking.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. The member for La Trobe is a great example of a Labor MP advocating for high-quality education for the children in her electorate - and why wouldn't we on this side of the parliament? Here we are in the Asian region in the Asian century looking to the sources of competitiveness that will secure for our young people the splendid array of diversity and career opportunities. Do you know, Speaker, that, in the Asian century, four of the five top schooling systems are in our own region? That is our competition in the Asian region.                 When you look at the sources of competitiveness in the Asian century, the preeminent source of competitiveness is investing in the talents of our young people, developing the skills and nurturing the creativity of our young people. That is what the National Plan for School Improvement does, and our aspiration is to be in the top five schooling systems under the blueprint by 2025. But the obstacles are there in numbers on the other side of the parliament. On the other side of the parliament sits a man who strains every sinew in his body every day trying to work out new ways of pressuring state premiers not to sign up to the National Plan for School Improvement. This is the man who puts his personal ambition ahead of the ambitions and aspirations of 3½ million Australian schoolchildren. As he turns his back, he is saying that his ambitions are more important than the aspirations of 3½ million schoolchildren.                 We stand on the threshold of great Labor reforms in the great Labor reforming tradition. Universal health care through Medicare, universal retirement incomes through compulsory superannuation and universal high-quality education through the National Plan for School Improvement. Every one of those are great Labor reforms. What else do they have in common, apart from the fact that they are great Labor reforms? Every one of them has been vehemently opposed by the coalition - Medicare, superannuation and the National Plan for School Improvement. In relation to Medicare, we prevailed. You had, on the other side, a surrender. They said Medicare must stay. They opposed compulsory superannuation every time, but we prevailed. And on the National Plan for School Improvement, Labor will prevail. We will defeat you; we will see you off because it is a great Labor reform in the Labor reforming tradition.

  I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and his commitment in this area. He knows that our government have taken real action to help modern families with childcare needs and to make sure that our kids do not get left behind because we are a government that knows that we need a quality early childhood education and care sector if we are to build a stronger, smarter and fairer Australia. That is why we are incredibly proud of tripling the funding to the sector. We are proud of increasing the childcare rebate from 30 to 50 per cent and we are proud of improving the affordability of care for Australian families. But it is also why we have worked so hard to lift the quality of care.                 We on this side of the House know that things have changed. We know that we can no longer view this sector as a simple babysitting service. This is about critical early childhood education and care. It is about investing in our children's future. We all now know that over 90 per cent of brain development occurs in the first five years of a child's life. All of the research clearly shows that what happens in these years is critical to their future educational attainments and social and health outcomes. That is why we have worked to successfully negotiate agreement with every state and territory government of every different political persuasion to work together to lift the quality of care for Australian early childhood education and care. We have done this with the new child-to-staff ratios. We have done this with higher qualification standards so that we can be sure that children get the care, expertise and attention they deserve.                  We are the party that believes that education is the way we transform people's lives and ensure they have greater opportunities than the parents and the grandparents that came before them. We have invested over $25 billion in this sector going forward to see better outcomes for children's learning, to see a commitment to quality education, and to, of course, support parents' workforce participation. A Labor government would never risk leaving children behind by returning to the underinvestment that we saw under the coalition government. We know that families are deeply concerned that the opposition today will not commit to the current levels of investment in quality early education and care. We know that they are all over the place, flip-flopping about their commitment to these quality reforms, because it turns out that they do not actually care very much about education.                  Only Labor has plans to build a stronger, smarter and fairer Australia. Early childhood education and care is a key foundation of a stronger and fairer nation, and only Labor can be relied upon to invest in the sector and to save it from the devastating cuts that those opposite have in mind.

  I thank the member for her question, and the answer really is a simple one. I am surprised that members opposite do not recognise it. People smuggling, like other transnational crimes, change the way in which they work depending on law enforcement. Of course, what started to happen because of turning back boats was that boats were sabotaged, people were in the water and, of course, Australian personnel then went to their assistance because they would not leave them there to drown.                 That is the circumstance to which people like former Chief of Defence Force, Admiral Barrie, have been referring in recent days; referring to a circumstance where that puts our ADF personnel at risk. So I would say to the member that if she is seriously interested in this - seriously interested, as opposed to trying to make a political point - that she study the words of our former Chief of Defence Force, who you would assume, in all courtesy and respect, would know something about those circumstances on the high seas. I do not see how anybody in the parliament or the advisers box could seek to treat a person like that with discourtesy or a lack of respect.                 So in his professional opinion, Admiral Barrie has said loudly and publicly that this puts ADF personnel at risk. Understanding that - understanding the facts of the matter - ensuring that we work in accordance with the best possible advice and ensuring that we do not put our ADF members at unnecessary risk, the government have understood that you cannot embark on such a policy and end up risking lives.                 To the Leader of the Opposition and others in the opposition who say, slogan-wise, that they want to pursue this kind of policy, can I suggest that they reflect very, very deeply on the risks to Australian personnel and the risks to life that they are talking about. In this area where the opposition are so given to sloganising, at some point they may want to produce a detailed, costed document - not something full of assertions about what they can do with Indonesia but something that deals with the facts; not something full of assertions about turning back boats but something that deals with the facts; and not something full of assertions about temporary protection visas but something that deals with the facts.                 The Australian people are entitled to that degree of courtesy and respect. Unfortunately, day after day after day the opposition refuses to show it.

  I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. He has a lot of workers from the car industry in his electorate, and so he has a very keen interest in the industry. Of course, auto manufacturing is a very important industry in this country, and it is also a very graphic example of how the stupid and irresponsible policies of the opposition are undermining business confidence, how they are undermining investments and how they are destroying job security. This is an industry that provides jobs directly and indirectly to about 250,000 people in this country. It is an industry that generates skills, research and development and industrial capabilities, like robotics and advanced manufacturing, that are very important for the economy. Those are some of the reasons why the government remains very committed to auto manufacturing in this country.                 Our new car plan provides for $5.4 billion of assistance to the sector to the year 2020. But what an astonishing thing: at a time when we have pressures from the high value of the Australian dollar, the pressures of global economic uncertainty, the pressures of intense international competition and the transition that is taking place in our country, how astonishing that notwithstanding all of those things the greatest threat to every motor-vehicle-manufacturing worker's job in this country are the opposition leader and the coalition's policies. They are the ones threatening this industry.                 This is the fact of the matter: the opposition plans to cut assistance to this industry by $500 million to the year 2015 - over the next two years - and to put at risk a further $1½ billion beyond 2015. You could not have a more concrete example of a policy position that can destroy an industry and destroy tens of thousands of jobs. That is exactly what the coalition is proposing to do, and it could not have been made any more clear than by Mr Mike Devereux, the general manager and CEO of General Motors Holden in Australia, just last week. He spelt out exactly what the coalition's policy will mean. This is important for many, many workers and their families in South Australia and in Victoria in particular, because Mr Devereux said quite clearly that Holden would cease manufacturing in this country should the coalition's policy be implemented. It would destroy tens of thousands of jobs. You could not get a more concrete example of the choice that people have at this coming election. If you stand for the car industry and workers in it, vote Labor!

  It has been getting clearer and clearer across question time but it is crystal clear from this question: we are dealing with an opposition with no policies and plans for the nation's future and so they come in here with ridiculous questions about political staff. Well, you would think that the Leader of the Opposition might have more on his mind than this game playing, but of course he does not, because they sit there mired in their negativity with no plan for jobs, no plan for health, no plan for education other than plans for cuts. To the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition -                      Thank you very much. To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question, I actually think the parliament is better than this - than stupid things about political staff. For the government, what we believe in is putting the jobs of Australians first. All this has proved is the vacuousness of the opposition and their lack of policies.

  I thank the member for Bass for his question. Indeed, when it comes to infrastructure funding, on this side of the House we do the analysis, we undertake the proper process and we ensure that we have the business cases. That is why we established Infrastructure Australia, one of our first pieces of legislation when we formed office, introduced in February 2008 in the first fortnight's parliamentary sittings. The Leader of the Opposition last week was committing to establish Infrastructure Australia when he said, 'If we are elected we will form an organisation called Infrastructure Australia.' It is typical of the lack of policy detail of those opposite when it comes to infrastructure.                     In a way it would be funny if it was not so serious, if those opposite did not seek to control the treasury bench. This month I was in Launceston with the member for Bass and there I announced funding for a detailed business case for the Launceston bypass, part of our $500 million fully costed commitment to upgrade the Midland Highway - to upgrade parts of it, making it clear what we can do with that money and what we cannot do with that money.                 The Leader of the Opposition has promised $400 million to fully duplicate the Midland Highway. Unfortunately, it is a $2.7 billion project. When he was asked about it, they did not have any proper analysis but he said, 'I certainly have been in informal discussions with people.' That is what he said. Well, I say to the Leader of the Opposition: give us the mob that can build a $2.7 billion duplication of the Midland Highway for $400 million and we'll sign up straightaway! This was a policy that was done on the back of a coaster somewhere in Tassie. Probably after a light beer shandy, the Leader of the Opposition got out the coaster and wrote out this policy. Of course he has got form, because he also said when speaking about the East West Link that he had spoken to Infrastructure Australia, and we know that that is not true. When he speaks about roads he repeats the falsehood. When he speaks about roads he speaks about ' aspirations'. Now we have apparitions - apparitions instead of real projects with real money to create real jobs to create real roads.

  I thank the member for this question. It enables me to restate what I have said to the parliament frequently and during the course of this week. What addressing these issues requires is not only a government that is determined and guided by experts but also the opposition to not use its negativity to block legal changes that would make a difference. The member who asked the question put his hand up for more boats.

  I thank the member for McEwen very much for that question. He represents an area with a lot of young families and does a great job in it. He understands, like everybody on this side of the parliament, that Australians face a very, very clear choice between a government that will do everything possible to support families and those opposite who just want to cut to the bone.                 We of course are the government that introduced Australia's first national Paid Parental Leave scheme and I can tell the parliament that it has now benefited 300,000 families in Australia. Three hundred thousand families have benefited because of this government's Paid Parental Leave scheme. And of course it was this government that introduced the schoolkids bonus to make sure that children and their families get the money when they need it and this is helping around one million Australian families. One million Australian families are getting that extra cash to help them meet the costs of their children going to school.                 What do we know about those opposite? Those opposite are going to claw back every single cent of that schoolkids bonus - $15,000 will come out of the pockets of families over the school life of their children. I have been surprised to receive some letters from those opposite, writing to me about constituents of theirs who would like to receive the schoolkids bonus. I would say to the member for Stirling: have you informed all of your constituents - all the thousands and thousands of families who currently get the schoolkids bonus - that if the Liberal Party is elected at the next election you will remove all of that money from those families? Have you told them, the member for Canning or the member for Barker up the back there? All of them out there are saying to me, 'Our families want to the schoolkids bonus.' It is up to you to get out there and make sure you tell each and every one of them that you will be taking $15,000 out of the pockets of those families. This Labor government will make sure that they get the help when they need it.

  It is a deep irony that at the same time we are seeing a carbon price and an emissions-trading scheme introduced in a province in China we get this question from those opposite, who used to believe in an emissions-trading scheme but no longer believe in it. Of course, we on this side of the House understand that an emissions-trading scheme is the most efficient way to price carbon. We understand that you cannot be a prosperous economy in the 21st century unless you are substantially powered by renewable energy. Of course, a carbon price for a fixed period moving to a floating price is exactly the way to go. That has been all of the advice we have received and it will stand this country in good stead for years and years to come.                 In contrast to the policy of those opposite, their direct action policy, which will cost every household $1,200 on the budget bottom line - $1,200 going out of households - what we have done is put a price on the largest polluters in our economy, provided assistance to those who are affected by that and ensured a future for our country in renewable energy. Of course, it is deeply ironic that this question should be asked today when forces within the coalition are talking about getting rid of the renewable energy target as well. I could not think of anything more disruptive to our future prosperity or to our economy in the first term than such a reckless act as that. That is why they do not have the support of the business community in terms of their wrecking ball tactics when it comes to the renewable energy target.                 We are proud that we have priced carbon. We are proud that we have taken action against dangerous climate change. There is a very clear choice in this parliament. Everyone on this side understands the importance of dealing with dangerous climate change, putting in place the most cost-effective method to price carbon to secure our prosperity for the future.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question and for her ongoing passion for improving children's education. Just before question time started I noted that the member for Ryan acknowledged that the Chapel Hill State Primary School joins us in the gallery today. I advise the House and those from Chapel Hill primary school, who are very welcome here, that under the government school funding reforms we believe that in the order of $2.6 million more would be made available to that primary school, an increase of 28 per cent, because we think the children in the gallery and children around the country are worth that additional investment. We believe that every child in every school -                      And while I might be interjected against when talking about children's education, that happens because the opposition are trying to obscure from the Australian people that they stand for deep cuts in education as opposed to the additional investment we want to make sure goes to every school around the country. We want to see available to schools around the country $14.5 billion of additional investment between state and federal governments, and of course we want to index funds as well with the federal government indexation rate at 4.7 per cent. That is an average in base funding of $4,000 extra for every Australian student and $1.5 million for every school in the country.                 Because this is a needs based system, it means that money flows where the need is the greatest. We have released today new data about what our school funding plan would mean for the Northern Territory. Under our plan, the Northern Territory would receive $300 million extra for Northern Territory schools: $205 million for government schools; $95 million for non-government schools. This would enable schools in the Northern Territory to increase the amount of effort they are able to put into children's education. And it would particularly benefit Indigenous children in the Northern Territory because the way in which the loadings work recognise that we can ensure that our Indigenous children get a great education, but it requires extra investment and extra care.                 I call on the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory to join with conservatives like Premier O'Farrell in endorsing this direction for our country's future. Our kids are worth it, and we cannot be the strong, prosperous nation we want to be for the future unless we get school funding right. The current model is broken. It is time for that to be recognised by the Northern Territory Chief Minister signing on to our plan for school improvement.

  To the Leader of the Opposition: yet again we see the mendacious fear campaign continue. What he is trying to do in this question, as he has done around the country, is pretend to the Australian people that all increases in electricity pricing are somehow due to carbon pricing. That is not true; it has never been true. In pretending that it is true, the Leader of the Opposition is trying to pull the wool over people's eyes. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition has been the person who has been out there refusing to recognise some of the real drivers of electricity costs, refusing to recognise the contribution of the so-called goldplating to the system, not recognising factors -                      Thank you very much. I was asked a question about electricity prices, and the Leader of the Opposition specifically used global figures, not figures associated with carbon pricing, and that is the point. The Leader of the Opposition has been out there pretending to the Australian people that every increase in electricity is about carbon pricing. That is not true, has never been true. This is a campaign of falsehood. A mendacious campaign designed to mislead the Australian people.                 The Leader of the Opposition well knows, if he wants to be truthful about this, that we have factors in electricity pricing, like the so-called goldplating of the network. He refused to speak about that publicly last year when I was working through, with premiers and chief ministers from around the country, what we could do about the design of the electricity market to make a difference for families. We did work that through. We agreed it in COAG in December, despite the Leader of the Opposition, during an issue of national importance, being out there talking nonsense about electricity pricing. We dealt with the central issues at the Council of Australian Governments in order to provide some relief for families.                 Of course if it was just this false claim on carbon pricing, that would be one thing. But the false claims just stack up and stack up and stack up. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that he said during 2012:                 I've just come back from China _ and the last thing they want to do _ is [hit] their people with a carbon tax.                 Then he went on to say, 'China is never going to hit themselves with an emissions trading scheme.' As usual on carbon pricing: wrong, wrong and wrong. The Leader of the Opposition is pretending that other countries are not acting, when China has acted and countries around the world are acting. It is the Leader of the Opposition who is left behind with his falsehoods and his fear campaign.

  I thank the member for that question. Australia does have a combination of economic strengths that are unrivalled elsewhere in the developed world. Australia is the world's twelfth-largest economy. Overnight we have had the G8 meeting in Northern Ireland. I think it pays a little just to think about comparisons between those G8 economies and the Australian economy, because I think this does demonstrate our economic strengths that are not acknowledged - particularly by those opposite.                     If you look at us compared to, say, the G8 economies, we have grown substantially faster -                      than every single G8 economy. Our unemployment rate is lower than every G8 economy bar one, and our debt is a fraction of the debt of the G8 economies. So Australia is in a very different position, and we are in a very different position because our top priority from day one has been to put jobs and economic growth first - and that stands in stark contrast to some of the economic strategies that have been applied in the G8. Vicious austerity programs have not worked in the G8 and the contrast is there: the Australian economy 14 per cent larger than it was at the end of 2007; the British economy, for example, four per cent lower than it was at the end of 2007.                 The contrasts are very clear but, of course, in the face of this evidence, in the face of these facts, those opposite go out and talk our economy down all of the time. One of the areas where they do it is when it comes to the strength of our public finances. Our net debt is 11.4 per cent of GDP - far, far lower than any net debt across the other developed economies - and this low level of borrowings has served as the buffer to enable us to strengthen our economy to support jobs and growth. And, of course, this is acknowledged by most credible participants in our national economic conversation, with the exception of the Tea Party-ers who sit opposite. It is recognised in particular by the major global rating agencies. The three major global rating agencies have got a AAA rating with a stable outlook for Australia. There are only nine countries in that category, of which Australia is one.                 So we have promoted jobs and growth in this country, and our approach stands in stark contrast to that of those opposite who say they will take out the axe and they will viciously cut public expenditure, particularly when it comes to health and education and the impact of that on jobs. We also understand that in this environment it is important to invest for the future, to invest for the prosperity of tomorrow, which is why we are focused on investment in education - once again opposed by those opposite, thereby demonstrating they have not got a clue about economic growth -

  I thank the member for her question and I can assure her that this government is very focused on manufacturing, very focused on car making and consequently very focused on the future of Holden because we understand how important car making is to the Australian economy and to the million Australians who work in manufacturing, and we understand how important Holden is to the economy of South Australia, which is why I was very disturbed when I read in the Adelaide Advertiser that Matt Hobbs, the head of government affairs at Holden, said that they would cease manufacturing if there was any reduction in taxpayer support. Of course, that is the policy of the member who asked the question and of the opposition. As to what they have said, indeed the member who asked the question has said this directly and I quote her own words. She said:                 'We have to end this embarrassing cap-in-hand approach to government and secret deals behind closed doors,' _                     I was asked a question about support for jobs at Holden and I am answering that question about support for jobs at Holden. Yes, this government will support jobs in car making. Yes, we will continue the co-investments we have agreed to with Holden. Yes, we will do everything we can to resist the opposition's plan to rip half a billion dollars away from that industry support and to cost 2,000 hardworking Australians their jobs. That is the big risk in South Australia and that is the big risk at Holden. If the opposition were ever elected it would cost those South Australians their jobs. Of course, if you pull the plug on Holden in South Australia, as the opposition is intending to do, you not only pull the plug on those direct car making jobs; you pull the plug on thousands and thousands of other jobs in South Australia and in the supply chain. So let me be very clear to the member from Indi that we will never endorse her reckless plan to see those thousands of Australians thrown on the unemployment scrapheap.                 Now, when it comes to carbon pricing and manufacturing, the member for Indi and the Leader of the Opposition have consistently engaged in a campaign of fear about this. The claims they have made are actually untrue. The dollar claims they have made about car making are absolutely untrue, and anybody who knows about car making recognises that the big pressures on car making in this country are the strength of the Australian dollar and what that does for competitiveness. So we will focus on the real issues and we will focus on Australian jobs because that is what Labor governments do.

  I can assure the member for Melbourne that I am aware of the updated Critical decade report of the Climate Commission that shows that there is stronger evidence than before of rapidly changing climate - that is, there is stronger evidence than before of dangerous climate change. The government, understanding that climate change is real, that it is caused by human activity, has already put in place the policies and plans to tackle dangerous climate change - that is, we have recognised that the best way of reducing carbon pollution is to put a price on carbon.                 The member for Melbourne knows that in this parliament this has been a very vexed debate, even though the Leader of the Opposition and so many people who sit behind him sat in the Howard government cabinet and said that, yes, they believed in putting a price on carbon and that they, the Leader of the Opposition and so many others on the front bench, went to the 2007 election, saying that they believed in putting a price on carbon and that if they were re-elected they would create an emissions trading scheme.                 But, unfortunately, instead of following through with that Howard government policy design in opposition and maintaining their beliefs, the opposition have gone for the cheap and reckless politics that we have seen played out in our nation since. Even today we have seen the opposition talking about carbon pricing. I was actually astonished that the shadow Treasurer would come into this parliament and ask about comparative pricing of carbon with nations overseas when for most of this parliament the opposition have marched into this chamber pretending that no-one else in the world prices carbon. Well, there is that shattered by themselves today. They now acknowledge that other people price carbon. So what is their remaining argument? Other people price carbon, so that is gone. They have acknowledged that today. They were interjecting instead. Apparently they have got some issues about the price, not recognising of course that for our trade exposed sectors the effective carbon price is $1.30.                 To the Leader of the Opposition and to those who peddle the nonsense on that side of the parliament, can the Leader of the Opposition say - will he ever say, will he say in this parliament or anywhere else - that the plan that they have costs the Australian community less per tonne of carbon pollution removed from our atmosphere than the government's plan? If he is saying that - and apparently he is - then he ought to produce some facts and figures that stack that up, because that claim is patiently absurd. He is asking the nation to pay more to deal with dangerous climate change. We stand for the most efficient way of doing it, as did Prime Minister John Howard.

  I thank the member for Wakefield for his question, because manufacturing is an absolutely fundamental part of the Australian economy. It employs about one million people in well-skilled and high-paid jobs. The manufacturing sector, as the Prime Minister indicated earlier, has been experiencing pressures from things such as the high value of the Australian dollar and intense international competition. That is why the government has put in place a series of policy measures to support the industry: things like the Steel Transformation Plan and targeted assistance for particular industries and firms - the $5.4 billion New Car Plan and our $1 billion Plan for Australian Jobs.                 But there are greater risks to manufacturing in this country - from the job-cutting policies of the opposition. They plan to cut assistance, for example, to the motor vehicle manufacturing sector by $500 million over the next two years and place great uncertainty over a further $1½ billion in assistance after 2015. All of that is at risk under the stated policy of the coalition. That is a policy that would kill Australia's motor vehicle manufacturing industry stone dead.                      The member for Indi must know it. The industry would be telling the member for Indi that that policy will destroy tens of thousands of jobs.                      And that is not some piece of political rhetoric; that is the reality of the policy position -                      General Motors Holden have made this position extremely clear in the comments that they have been making over the last week or so - that is, that, if the coalition's cuts to assistance to motor vehicle manufacturing were put into place, Holden would cease manufacturing in this country. That puts thousands of people's jobs at risk under the coalition's policy. It is clear and unequivocal. Over $1 billion of investment by General Motors in their Australian operations has been put at risk because of that coalition policy. That means job security is undermined and now pay cuts are on the agenda.                  That is the coalition's policy in action: funding cuts, job cuts, pay cuts, slashing funding, smashing jobs and destroying job security. That is the coalition. That is what we have learned from coalition governments in the past. I had plenty of experience of it in my former work as a union official. The coalition always cuts funds, cuts jobs and slashes pay. That is what you are doing in the auto manufacturing sector in this country with your policy. You should rip it up, chuck it out and do the right thing.

  To member for Boothby: as the last question was answered to the member for Indi, so I answer it to him. I do ask him, as a South Australian member in this parliament, how he can sit in all good conscience and back the Leader of the Opposition's plan to rip half a billion dollars out of industry assistance, knowing as we know now from the words of Holden that, if that occurs, 2,000 people working for Holden will lose their jobs. The member has asked me a question about the jobs at Holden -                      I was asked about jobs and I am answering about jobs. Let me be very clear to the member for Boothby, who really ought not to be following the Leader of the Opposition down this path, given that he represents South Australia in this place. For all of the false claims that have been made about carbon pricing and car making, the truth is that the impact of carbon pricing on car making is less than a variation of half a cent in the value of the Australian dollar - that is, it is a very minor impact. What it means is that the major impact that is weighing on car making in this country is the strength of the Australian dollar - the fact that we have seen a 50 per cent appreciation in our currency over the last few years. That means that you actually need to have sophisticated, thought-through policies about how to hold manufacturing in this country and not have our economy hollowed out. That means you need to focus on the pivotal role of car manufacturing, because car making is such a bringer of the skills and capacities that you need to sustain manufacturing generally.                 Anybody who has ever walked into a manufacturing establishment and asked the workers there where they came from and where else they have worked will have met person after person who got their start and their skills in car making. That is why it is important. That is why this government has taken a co-investment approach, that is why we are working to hold the jobs at Holden and that is why we are so bitterly opposed to the plan of the member for Boothby to destroy 2,000 South Australian jobs - and his constituents ought to know it. He is standing behind the Leader of the Opposition's plan to end 2,000 jobs directly in South Australia and thousands upon thousands beyond that - something that would hurt the families of Boothby, something that would hurt the people of South Australia, something that would hurt the Australian economy and something that would bring particular devastation to those individual workers. In all good conscience, the member for Boothby should say to the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Indi that he will not support this job-destroying plan.                  Leave not granted.

  I thank the member for Werriwa for his question. He, of course, cares about ensuring that young people and unemployed Australians in his electorate get an opportunity, and that is why we need to reform the 457 visa scheme. It has been identified that there are deficiencies in the scheme that would ensure that, if we were not to reform this scheme, there will be Australians that miss out on jobs.                 This government will not allow that to happen. For that reason, we announced the reforms that are before the parliament to ensure that those deficiencies in the current scheme will be fixed, so that employers look locally first. We can have a discussion and a debate about this - and there will be attempts by those opposite to deflect and distract on things that are not relevant to the debate - but, when it all boils down to it, this comes down to whether employers look locally first.                 It is this government's view that the very important temporary skilled scheme should be used, but it should be used when there are legitimate shortages in our economy. For that reason, the reforms will not be going to capping the scheme; they will be based on the legitimate shortages wherever they exist in the labour market. They will have to ensure that the skills shortages are legitimate and needed, and that can only be done by testing the market -                      There have been attempts by those opposite to distract from this debate by suggesting that the reforms are discriminatory. They are not discriminatory. We have a non-discriminatory immigration policy, and, as a migrant, I find it deeply offensive that people would suggest that we would do anything other than ensure that we recognise the contribution that immigration makes and continues to make to this country. This is about ensuring that local workers get an opportunity. This is about ensuring that young Australians that are going through training get an opportunity first. This is about ensuring that graduates that come out of university are offered entry-level, professional jobs before they are sought overseas. We should not be doing anything other than supporting these reforms, because they will ensure that, yes, the scheme will operate effectively, but it will also ensure that there is a legitimacy behind the applications. Currently that is not the case. It is quite surprising that the opposition choose not to support Australian workers and young Australians in getting opportunities -                  During a debate, a Member may not anticipate the discussion of a subject listed on the Notice Paper and expected to be debated on the same or next sitting day.                 In actual fact, it has been anticipated.                     These are the sorts of games we expect from the opposition. They do not want to talk about this matter, because in the end they are not concerned about Australian workers. This is the party of Work Choices trying to prevent opportunities for Australians. This is the party of Work Choices trying to deny young graduates entry-level professional jobs. These reforms are necessary to ensure they have those opportunities, and I would call upon the parliament to support reforms.

  To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: I believe that in question time yesterday she put to me a quote of mine from 2002. She is now putting to me a statement of the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Rudd, in 2007. To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: this is 2013, and so both of those statements are in the past. Yesterday I referred to the challenge of contemporary circumstances. I know coping with the modern age might be too much for the opposition.                     Coping with the modern age might be too much for the opposition. They might be unable to contemplate anything that has happened since 2007.                     But let me assure the Leader of the Opposition, who interjects now, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, of course, during the modern age we need to deal with modern facts. Among the modern facts we need to deal with is that the Indonesian government have wholeheartedly repudiated the statements made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition when she has pretended to have an arrangement with them. They have repudiated her shallow attempts to try and pretend to the Australian community that she has some special deal with Indonesia.                 I would also refer her to the fact that people who actually know about these matters - that is, not the Leader of the Opposition, not the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and not people who sit here in the comfort of this parliament but people who actually go out on the high seas for the Australian nation, like Chris Barrie, former Chief of Navy, and have had to command others who have done this dangerous and difficult work - are now providing, in the modern age, in contemporary times and indeed, when I refer to former Admiral Chris Barrie, as recently as 17 June, advice about how this would put ADF personnel at risk.                 I ask the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: on a policy area of importance, on something as important as safety at sea for our ADF personnel, could they try and be a little bit better than this. Could they try and be a little bit better than these cheap and silly games. There they sit, with absolutely no answers, day after day insulting Indonesia and day after day insulting those who actually have expertise on the high seas, with absolutely no policies and absolutely no plans, mired in this kind of frivolous conduct, whilst we get on with the important work of doing what the nation needs done, including in the area of refugee and asylum seeker policy, where day after day they sit there and use their negativity to try and deny the nation the best approaches.

  I particularly thank the member for Lyons for his question and acknowledge his long-term advocacy for regional communities and for the transformative effects of education. It gives me the opportunity to talk about the importance of the National Plan for School Improvement to our regional communities, our $14.5 billion plan which builds on Labor's long-term commitment to education. It builds on our capital investments that were made through the Building the Education Revolution and that are mocked by the other side of this chamber. Those have seen transformative effects in our regional schools - small classrooms being built, libraries across the country, sporting facilities and language centres. It builds on our national partnership program, which particularly has helped regional schools lift their literacy and their numeracy rates.                 The National Plan for School Improvement, in particular, sees some $6 billion in additional funding that will benefit regional, remote and very remote schools. That is 40 per cent of the additional funding that will go to regional, remote and very remote schools because it is a model that is based on need. Those of us who represent regional communities know that there is a disproportionate number of disadvantaged students in our regional, remote and very remote schools. We also know that the National Plan for School Improvement has both a location loading and a size loading, which means that there will be significant benefits for regional schools in that additional funding.                 Why is it important? We know it is important because OECD studies show that 15-year-old metropolitan students are the equivalent of 1½ years ahead of students in our remote schools across all measures of reading, of mathematics, of science and of literacy. I know the members opposite do not seem to be particularly interested in what this means for regional schools, but certainly those of us who represent regional communities are interested. We know that on NAPLAN testing, metropolitan kids are ahead on reading levels of kids in regional areas and in remote areas, and in very remote areas as well. We know that is important because we want our kids in regional communities to have every opportunity to have high-skilled, high-growth jobs. That is incredibly important. We know that location loading can be used for extra teachers, for specialist teachers, for better equipment and for all of those things that are incredibly important for regional students.                 On this side we know the transformative nature of education: our investment in the early years and our investment in uncapping university places. We know that what we are going to see under an Abbott government is not some $14.5 billion plus $6 billion extra for regional schools, but cuts to education - $16.2 billion worth of cuts to education, and that is bad for regional students. I call on the Victorian premier to support the education of our regional students, particularly given that he represents a regional community in Victoria.

  To the member who asked the question, what she ought to recognise is that this government came to this parliament following a High Court case and asked for this parliament to put the government in the same position the Howard government had been in in terms of powers relating to asylum seekers. We came to this parliament following a High Court ruling and said, 'We believe the government of the day should have the same powers available to it as the Howard government had.' And the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition generally decided to vote no to that. They decided to vote no to the government of the day having the same powers as the Howard government.                     There is a lot of screaming and carrying on, but that is the truth. To the member who asked the question, I say simply this: why did she come into this parliament and put her hand up for more boats? Why did she follow the Leader of the Opposition's lead and come in and put hand up for more boats? Then on alternatives to the current government's policy: what does she think the Leader of the Opposition means when he says, 'Stop the boats'? Actually these days he does not really say, 'Stop the boats.' Now he kind of shambles around and says, 'If I were ever Prime Minister, maybe some time after a few years I might be able to make some little bit of difference.'                 That is the current policy of the opposition. Why is the policy in that form? Because the Leader of the Opposition knows the things that he has put at the centre of the policy cannot be delivered. He knew that when he walked into the room with President Yudhoyono of Indonesia and refused to mention his policy to turn boats around. Then he tried to shamble in front of the media and was caught out.                 The member who asked the question might then ask herself, 'If the Leader of the Opposition can't mention that policy when he's Leader of the Opposition, what on earth would lead anybody to believe he's going to mention it when he's the Prime Minister if he's ever elected?' The Leader of the Opposition knows that at the centre of his so-called 'stop the boats' policy is an act of dishonesty, an act of trying to fool the Australian people.                 The Deputy Leader of the Opposition tried to add to that too, pretending she had a secret arrangement with Indonesia, and was repudiated by all. The member for Wentworth is being sent out on ABC TV trying to pretend that he supports this policy; but, once he was challenged about whether or not this would be unsafe if you did not get Indonesia's agreement - of course, there is no prospect of that - he said, 'Yes, it would be unsafe to do so.'                 Stop this mendacious campaign. Stop sending your backbenchers in to ask ridiculous questions. You know it is a fraud.

  I thank the member for Moreton for his question because, as the House heard earlier, overnight China started its first emissions trading scheme to reduce carbon pollution in the large southern city of Shenzhen. It is an extremely important development. They have started an emissions trading scheme. They have introduced carbon pricing into their economy. Carbon pricing in China. The Leader of the Opposition said it would never happen - no way in the world. After his insightful visits to China, he really got a good word, really got an insight into what was going on! Yet again the Leader of the Opposition is totally wrong. How humiliating to go visit our No. 1 trading partner, spread mendacious rubbish about their plans, tout that to the Australian community and deceive them.                 The fact of the matter is that China is introducing emissions trading schemes to put a price on carbon. Like Whyalla, Shenzhen city has not been wiped off the map. I am reliably advised that Shenzhen is doing just fine today. The lights are on. People are going to work. People are going to shop for groceries. There have not been unimaginable price increases. In fact, I am reliably informed the price of a roast duck has not skyrocketed to $100 as some fool like Senator Barnaby Joyce might have predicted. This is extremely important. The stock market has not crashed either. In fact, the stock market closed up on the first day of emissions trading.                     I withdraw.                 The fact of the matter is that the scheme that started in Shenzhen overnight covers about 600 companies responsible for about 40 per cent of their greenhouse gas emissions. It is important that the House be aware that China intends to launch further emissions trading schemes like this in this year in places like Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai.                     I am asked by the member for North Sydney for the price. I understand the units traded for about $5 overnight compared to an Australian business that is emissions intensive and trade exposed experiencing an effective carbon price of just $1.30 a tonne. That is the price you should be comparing it to. The economics of it is a bit complex, and I know the member for North Sydney struggles with numbers, but he tries his best.                 Really, the claims of the Leader of the Opposition about the action taken by China are ridiculous. He said, 'China is never going to hit themselves with an emissions trading scheme' - absolutely wrong. More mendacious claims. The fact of the matter is that the rest of the world is tackling climate change, Australia is working with them and we will remain committed to it. You are looking increasingly silly.

  Yet again, with an important issue, here we see the cheapest of politics being played. The member who asked the question came into this parliament and voted for more boats - that is what she did. She voted to deny this government the powers the Howard government had to address refugee and asylum-seeker issues. And, yes, she should be ashamed of that. The Leader of the Opposition should be ashamed of that. Every member of the opposition should be ashamed of the way they decided to go for the politics rather than Australia's national interest. Indeed, they should be listening to people like the former minister for immigration -                      I thank the member for proving my point: that if there is ever a choice between national security or the playing of the cheapest and ugliest politics, they are there with the cheapest and ugliest of politics. But there was one member of the opposition who has had experience in this matter and whose words should be listened to, and that is the former minister for immigration, Mr Philip Ruddock, who actually has talked during the life of this parliament about the complexity of this issue. He said:                 You're going to have to use all of the measures that we used -                  a reference to the Howard government policies -                  then you'd be looking around to see what more you could do.                 His words. And when this government came into this parliament with a proposal to do more, with a proposal to do something differently, with a proposal to work with Malaysia, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'No, I don't want to see a difference made to the number of people arriving in Australia by boat, I want to vote for more boats.' That is what the Leader of the Opposition said.                 Having voted for more boats, is the Leader of the Opposition the custodian of the solution? Well, did he put a solution to President Yudhoyono? No, he did not. Is he saying to the Australian people now that he will 'stop the boats'? No, he is not. He is saying: 'Sometime in the future, if I am ever Prime Minister, I might seek to make a difference by the final year of the first term.' He does not say any longer that you can rely on him to 'stop the boats'. And that is because the Leader of the Opposition - who turns his back because he does not want to face up to all of the ridiculous claims he has made in this area - knows he does not have anything that resembles a policy. He does not even have a slogan anymore.                 Indonesia has repudiated him and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. They have no policy. They have no plan. Defence Force experts have repudiated him and the things that he has claimed. They have no policy. They have no plan. This is a fraud - that's all it is.

  I thank the member for McEwen for his question. This week I have had the pleasure of spending time with representatives of local government who are here for the ALGA national assembly. On Sunday the Prime Minister and I hosted the Australian Council of Local Government, attended and spoken at by Senator Barnaby Joyce on behalf of the coalition, and today I spoke to the ALGA national assembly on their final day.                 A great example of us working with local government to deliver community infrastructure projects is through the Regional Development Australia Fund and also through the Liveable Cities Program, and today I announced a new round of funding for local governments. The government will fund $105 million to regional and rural councils through the Regional Development Australia Fund and $45 million to urban councils from the Liveable Cities Program. All councils and shires will share in this funding based upon the formula for financial assistance grants done by the Grants Commission.                 So, it is on a needs basis. Importantly, it is not in Canberra that what is good for local communities is being determined; it is local communities through their elected local representatives determining the priorities. The funding is for shovel-ready projects so that councils can kick-start additional economic activity in regional and local communities, creating jobs in construction but also creating better communities and improving the capacity for councils to upgrade swimming pools, ovals, libraries, arts centres, theatres, childcare centres - the range of services that are provided by local government in modern Australia.                 This is just one example of why it is important that the federal government continue to be able to offer funding directly through local government and why our Constitution should recognise the reality of modern Australia: that we have three tiers of government and that local government is uniquely positioned to be able to determine the local priorities at the local level. That is why the referendum on 14 September is important. It is important that our modern Constitution reflect the modern reality of Australia and our governance structures, but it is also important to put beyond doubt the ability of the federal government to partner on programs such as these: the Roads to Recovery program, the heavy vehicle safety program, the Black Spot Program. We need to make sure that the yes vote is carried in the referendum and I look forward -

  I would like to thank the member for Bass for his question. He like everyone else in the Labor Party is interested in low-income workers and what we do for their retirement savings. He may be aware that there are 425,000 shop assistants in Australia who earn less than $37,000 and there are 83,000 cleaners and laundry workers and 185,000 Australians who work in hospitality and food preparation. All of these people earn less than $37,000 a year. In fact there are 3½ million Australians who earn less than $37,000 a year.                 That is why on 1 July 2012 it was Labor who axed the tax on superannuation taxes for people who earn less than $37,000 a year. No longer in Australia, if you earn less than $37,000, do you pay a 15 per cent tax on your superannuation. In fact in the next two months 3½ million Australians who work part time or full time and earn less than $37,000 are going to get more money in their superannuation, and for one reason - the Labor government.                 I have been asked, though, whether there are any bad policy ideas out there and, just as our axing the tax is a good idea, there is a bad idea. The bad idea had its most recent run in the paddock courtesy of the Leader of the Opposition in his reply to the budget speech when he said that he will introduce a great big new tax on the superannuation -                      The Leader of the Opposition said on 16 May that there would be a great big new tax on the superannuation contributions of people who earn less than $37,000. This is a bad policy for three simple reasons. Firstly, a person who earns $37,000 pays an effective tax rate on their income of about 9½ per cent - fair enough. But if the Liberals were elected, they would pay 15 per cent on their super. What economic genius in the coalition said it was better for low-paid workers to pay more tax on their super than on their take-home income?                 But it does not stop there. There is another bad reason for this 15 per cent coalition tax. It is that 2.2 million Australians earning less than $37,000 are women. Women already have a gender pay gap. Women already do not get the chance to save as much money as men for retirement. But do you think that will stop the coalition putting a new tax on part-time women workers? Not at all. They want to put a new tax.                 But of course the real problem in what they are proposing is not that they want to rob shop assistants or cleaners or kitchen hands - that is bad enough, but that does not convince them. It is that they want to hand back billions of dollars to multinational mining companies. This is the problem. We want to axe the tax on low-paid workers - they want to rob them. We want multinational mining companies to pay some of their returns to all of Australia - they want to give it back. Hands off our superannuation.

  The Leader of the Opposition well knows, and so do members of this House well know, the government's design of carbon pricing. Yes, there is a fixed price for the first three years - the 'carbon tax' to use the terminology - and then it moves to an emissions trading scheme.                 When it moves to an emission trading scheme, Australian businesses will get the benefit of the international price for carbon pricing. What is remarkable about this question is that the Leader of the Opposition is quoting prices from other nations when he has spent the best part of two years telling Australians that no-one else in the world is pricing carbon other than Australia. So I thank him for acknowledging -                      I thank the Leader of the Opposition for again confirming that he now recognises that nations around the world are putting a price on carbon.                 What he does not seem to be realising is that he is shooting down one of the principal argument he has used publicly against carbon pricing. He has been out in the Australian community saying, 'Australia shouldn't go it alone; no-one else is doing this,' and then he comes into this chamber and asks about other people's prices.                 But the hypocrisy does not end there, because, under the government scheme, as we move to an emission trading scheme Australian businesses will be paying the world price - no more, no less. That is why we are doing things like linking our scheme to the scheme in the European Union.                 Who is opposed to that? Who is opposed to international linking? Who is opposed to Australian businesses having the benefits of the world price? The Leader of the Opposition is! It is specifically ruled out in his sham statements about so-called 'direct action', because this is a policy that does not make any sense and would certainly impose more costs on the Australian nation.                 Every reputable person who has looked at the Leader of the Opposition's plan has dismissed it as nonsense. It is the kind of policy you cobble together when you have been running a fear campaign and then you are not sure what to do next. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that he would be better advised to adopt the position he clearly had when he was a minister in the Howard government - that is, a position of putting a price on carbon.                 This is weathervane politics which is not in the national interest, not in the interests of Australian businesses, not in the interests of jobs and not in the interests of a clean energy future. All of this should be abandoned by the Leader of the Opposition. He should have the decency to do what Prime Minister Howard did and endorse carbon pricing.

  I thank the member for Werriwa for his question because it enables me to advise the House about the arrangements that have been made for the third annual Indonesia-Australia Leaders Meeting. I will visit Indonesia at the invitation of President Yudhoyono next month to attend this third annual leaders-level dialogue. Of course Indonesia is a close friend, a neighbour and one of our most important bilateral partners. Our relationship with Indonesia is both broad and very deep. We share in common so many interests. We have worked patiently and methodically to build the bonds between our two countries, stronger economic links, and we are working now on greater economic cooperation through the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership and people-to-people links - that is, young people in particular from Indonesia coming to Australia, studying here, and Australians going there. Australians certainly go in huge numbers to Indonesia, the most visited country other than New Zealand for Australians. We share not only strong bilateral relationships, doing things like fighting transnational crime, including people-smuggling; we share regional priorities and global priorities.                 With my visit it will be almost 130 times that there have been high-level visits and exchanges between our two countries under this government. That is equivalent to a visit almost every three weeks. We have a lot to talk about and a lot to work on. The comprehensive nature of this partnership does need to be recognised by anyone who wants to play a role in shaping this nation's future, which is why I was dismayed to see today that the Leader of the Opposition apparently does not understand that I have visited Indonesia before and that I have met with President Yudhoyono before. Of course I have met with him before. We have conducted a number of leader-level discussions. We have attended many multilateral fora together, including the East Asia Summit, the G20 and APEC; we have been at the UN together. We have worked comprehensively on the relationship between our two countries. I am very much looking forward to taking the next steps in that broad and deep relationship when I visit Indonesia at the request of the President, at his invitation, next month.

  I thank the shadow Treasurer for this question, because putting in place an emissions trading scheme is the least cost, most efficient way of reducing carbon pollution. We know that; that is the recommendation of virtually every expert inquiry conducted anywhere in the world. As the Prime Minister was saying before, we have opted for a fixed price in the early stages of the scheme, a fixed price to provide certainty and a fixed price to provide predictability. We are already seeing the outcome of that process: a significant reduction in emissions.                 What all of these questions really boil down to is that those opposite are so embarrassed by their direct action scheme they have to come out and somehow try to discredit an emissions trading scheme. Their scheme will cost the average Australian household $1,200 a year because what they have decided to do is to tax individuals -                      The answer is that we have a fixed price period before we move to a floating price - a very simple answer, but one that those opposite will not acknowledge because they are so embarrassed about their incapacity to respond to dangerous climate change and the fact that their policy is such an embarrassment. What they are going to do is to tax the average family $1,200 and give that money to big business, whereas our scheme works the opposite way. What we do is have the large polluters pay money for their pollution. What we do is assist industry with that money and we also provide assistance to punters in the community. Those on the other side have an opposite approach. What they will do is tax punters. You are so embarrassed by that fact that you come in here and try to discredit a carbon pricing scheme which is delivering reductions in emissions and making sure that we will be a prosperous country in the rest of this century. Shame on you.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I thank him for his deep interest in his local schools. I have had the opportunity to spend some time with him in his electorate and meet with some of the schoolchildren there. I know he wants them to have the best possible future. He wants them to go to the best possible schools. I thank him for his question because it enables me to say to the House that the role and responsibility of government is to do the big things that are necessary to shape our nation's future; to make sure that our country has a stronger, smarter and fairer future; to get the big things done that invest in that future on behalf of all Australians.                  That is why the government has time after time worked on major reforms which will strengthen us as a country - including creating a clean energy future; including investing in the National Broadband Network; including reforms in health and aged care; including building the National Disability Insurance Scheme; and, including, very importantly, so that every child and every Australian can have the best possible future, investing in those great institutions that create opportunity in our country - that is, Australian schools.                 We are investing in early childhood education because we want every child to get a flying start into the best possible life. We have created more apprenticeships and traineeships than have existed before in our country, because we want young people to have those all important skills, those trade qualifications for the future. We have created more university places than there have ever been before. We have put more into research and we have put more into innovation, because we want this country to be as smart as we know it can be. But we now want to ensure that every child in every school gets a great education so they can make the most of those opportunities for the future.                  This is, firstly, something that you build when you recognise the current funding model is broken. I recognise that; Premier O'Farrell recognises that; unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition defends that broken model. And then, having recognised that the model is broken, we come up with a well researched, careful plan for change, which is what we have been doing over more than five years now. Then you seek agreement for it. Once again I am calling on premiers and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory to do the right thing, to resist the political pressure from the opposition, to put our kids first. They should be recognising in their leadership of their areas that there is something more important to them than succumbing to the political pressure of the opposition, and that is getting every child in the schools they have responsibility for a great education.

  Thank you. This is starting to resemble a sort of catch-up hour for the opposition on details of a policy proposal that they have been running a fear campaign about for the best part of two years now. The government's policy on carbon pricing and heavy vehicles has been announced for a long period of time; and, yes, we do believe that heavy vehicles should be subject to a carbon price. There is absolutely nothing new in that.                  What appears to be new from the opposition's questioning today is: one, they appear to be trying to inform themselves of the details of a scheme that they have been out actually arguing against. You would have thought a rational person, an intelligent person, a clever person, would study the policy proposition first and then work out whether they were opposed to it or in favour of it - clearly not this Leader of the Opposition. He decided to go out with the opposition first and he is just trying to understand it now.                     -                      I speak to the nature of the interjections that have been coming across the dispatch box as all of this has been in progress, because those interjections have all been about other prices in other countries. Has the opposition today moved from its 'subsidy for polluters plan' back to saying that it supports an emissions trading scheme? Are we seeing a huge move by the opposition today? They are actually giving up their current policy and saying they support an emissions trading scheme. If they are saying that they support an emissions trading scheme with an internationally linked price, guess what? One is already legislated and one is going to come into existence. Thank you very much for finally coming around to supporting it and getting back into the same position you had under the leadership of Prime Minister John Howard. It is truly remarkable.                  Then of course in terms of the backflips and lack of care of the opposition, the Leader of the Opposition has been on the record in the past, and I quote the Leader of the Opposition: 'I also think that, if you want to put a price on carbon, why not just do it with a simple tax? Why not ask motorists to pay more?' All motorists, all households, all families, all mums, all dads - the Leader of the Opposition may be embracing that again as part of his backflipping today.                  Whilst the opposition wanders around on this topic, not sure what to do next, because the fear campaign is running out of puff, we will continue to get on with the job of reducing carbon pollution, of addressing dangerous climate change, of doing it in the cheapest possible way, of doing it in the way that responsible conservatives support. The Leader of the Opposition can stay there with his extreme position and try to sell that to the Australian people.

  I do thank the member for Fisher for this very important question, because the government indeed has considered the Sunshine Coast Institute of TAFE's Sunshine Coast Health and Social Wellbeing Learning Precinct as a part of the $500 million regional priorities round of the Education Investment Fund.                 The regional priorities round is designed to give students, staff and researchers in regional Australia access to world-class teaching, training and research facilities. I am pleased to advise the House, and the member for Fisher, that my office today has contacted the Sunshine Coast TAFE to advise that we will be providing $46.8 million to fund the new Sunshine Coast Health and Social Wellbeing Learning Precinct, which will offer TAFE students vocational education and training in certificate I to advanced diploma courses.                 The precinct is expected to generate more than 320 jobs during the construction phase, making a significant contribution to the Sunshine Coast economy. The precinct will include a community space funded by TAFE and its partners to house local health-related clinical and community programs. In addition, it will incorporate the University of the Sunshine Coast's node of the Cooperative Research Centre for Young People, Wellbeing and Information Technology.                 There is expected to be a sharp increase in regional demand for health workers, and this centre will accommodate an additional 950 full-time-equivalent student places within the first three years of operation, which will double student capacity. So, that is good news - good news for the Sunshine Coast. I thank the member for Fisher for his ongoing interest and advocacy. Other announcements in relation to the regional priorities round will be made shortly.

  I would like to thank the member for Moreton for that very important question, because the Australian economy has emerged as one of the strongest in the developed world and we have emerged that way because we have got the big economic calls right and we will continue to get them right after the next five years as well.                 We have had a period of remarkable global uncertainty, but we have performed so much better than other developed economies. We have an economy which is 14 per cent larger than it was at the end of 2007; an absolutely outstanding job creation record - almost one million additional jobs; and, of course, low unemployment at 5.5 per cent, low interest rates, strong public finances and a AAA credit rating from the three major global rating agencies for the very first time in our history. And, of course, we have low debt.                 All of these facts are something that we in this chamber should all be very proud of. Of course, what we now need to do is to build for the future. We need to build on this strength and we need to take the resilience we have demonstrated over the last five years and make sure that we make the investments for the future. Nothing is more important there than our investment in education - our investment in A National Plan for School Improvement - because if we are going to win this economic race in the Asian century we have to win the education race.                 It is very important that we get all states to sign on to this reform. In my home state of Queensland, Premier Newman does not want to sign on because he is taking his instructions from the Leader of the Opposition. This is worth $3.8 billion over six years for Queensland schools - $2.2 million extra on average per school in Queensland. Every single school in Queensland will be better off. There will be extra resources in the classroom, extra training for teachers and more support for the kids when they need it. This will mean that every kid in Queensland will get a better start in life if only the Liberal and National parties would put the children of Queensland first and their own political interests last. They have a week to sign up. We want to see some real interest in this issue in Queensland. It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to lift all of our students up so we can make the most of the next five years and beyond.

  When I visit Indonesia I will pursue broadening and deepening our relationship with Indonesia. We have strengthened that relationship. We have worked patiently over time. We, under the life of the Labor government, have created the annual leaders-level exchange. That was a very important development in our relationship. Apart from those annual exchanges with President Yudhoyono, of course I have the opportunity to see him in a wide variety of other forums. We talk at the G20.                     I was asked about my forthcoming visit to Indonesia and I was making the point that it builds on the back of a number of exchanges with President Yudhoyono that this government has had and that I have had as Prime Minister: engaging in annual leaders-level meetings, engaging in a number of contacts beyond that, attending the G20 together to talk about the shape of the global economy, attending the East Asia Summit together to talk about the future of our region, attending APEC together to talk about economic cooperation and growth in our region of the world, participating at events at the UN and attending Indonesia, particularly the Bali Democracy Forum as a co-host at President Yudhoyono's invitation.                 So when I meet with President Yudhoyono I will talk through the breadth and depth of the relationship between our two countries. Of course that will go to the work that we do on transnational crime, including people smuggling. What I will not do, of course, is take the approach of the opposition - that is, I will not take the approach of pretending that Indonesia have agreed to things when they have not. I will not take the approach of pretending that Indonesian officials say one thing in private and one thing in public - that is, I will not take the approach of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, which is delivering those kinds of insults to Indonesia. I also will not take the approach of the Leader of the Opposition, which is to walk around when a TV camera is there and beat his chest but when in front of President Yudhoyono, the President of Indonesia, lack the courage and the confidence to raise policy issues. I will not take that approach either.                 We will continue to build the mature relationship between our two countries and keep strengthening it for the future. That is what leadership requires, not this cheap posturing.

  I thank the member for his question. The answer is that it is important that every single student in our nation is able to get the resources applied in their school to their needs. That is why state premiers and chief ministers need to sign onto the National Plan for School Improvement. We are willing to invest almost $10 billion in additional Commonwealth money to make sure that kids get better support in schools. The Premier of New South Wales understands that. The Premier of South Australia understands that. At the school level I think people get it. We have principals in Victoria who understand it. I saw an article in the Colac Herald, which is fromthe member's electorate. On the front page we have a principal saying:                 It would mean we would be able to implement literary and numeracy support programs _                 A secondary principal said it would provide the 'best possible education experience for every student'.                 Let us look at Queensland. I think they get it on the ground in Queensland as well. Kenmore State High School, which is in the electorate of Ryan, would see their per student public funding grow between 2013 and 2019 at approximately 40 per cent. That is why in the letter the Kenmore State High School Parents and Citizens Association said that the current system is failing too many children and this important education reform will provide resources where they are needed most.                 It is actually time for those opposite to face up to these facts. The fact is that under A National Plan for School Improvement, their schools will see more resources going to help those students in need. The Kenmore High School P&amp;C Association meets on the third Monday evening of each month. Assuming that ministers and shadow ministers are not banned from going to a school in Queensland, I call on the P&amp;C to consider suspending standing orders and bring in the member for Sturt so that he can explain why he wants to sack one in seven hard-working teachers; bring in the Leader of the Opposition to explain why he thinks providing resources to government schools is an injustice. They could even bring in the member for Bowman: he could come across the city from the other side and he can hold up his 'I give a Gonski' poster, couldn't he? That is what it has come to. All of these resources that are there to assist the schools in your electorates, some of you are supporting it and, at the same time, some of you others are pretending that it will not make a difference at all. It is time for state premiers to put the interests of their students first and sign up to A National Plan for School Improvement. Better schools for all Australians.

  To the Leader of the National Party, and to the opposition generally, on these important matters - something as important as our relationship with Indonesia - they have really got to try and keep up. They really do need to try and keep up. The Leader of the Opposition was out today trying to pretend to the Australian people that somehow, as Prime Minister, I had never visited Indonesia. Completely ridiculous. That of course would be the kind of thing we would expect the Leader of the Opposition to say because today, too, he was out saying how the coalition had supported me travelling to New York to lobby for the Security Council bid, when of course what happened -                      I am referring to our relationship with Indonesia, and just making the point that once again the opposition is getting itself in a mess - the same kind of mess it got into when the Leader of the Opposition, despite his statement today, criticised me for going to New York to lobby for our Security Council bid, saying instead I should have gone to Jakarta, not realising that in New York was President Yudhoyono as well.                 But anyway, in all this confusion about Indonesia on the opposition side, let me be very clear to the Leader of the National Party: because we work on this relationship every day, because we have had exchanges numbering almost 130, because there have been comprehensive discussions between me and the president, and between ministers and their counterparts -                      Let me continue as I was: because we work on this relationship every day, because we have so many high-level exchanges and visits, issues relating to live animal exports have been comprehensively worked through between this government and the government of Indonesia. To the member who asked the question, I suggest he tries to keep up.                     Thank you very much. On issues of apology, I suggest that the Leader of the National Party would be better off speaking to the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and seeing if she will apologise for insulting Indonesia, if she will apologise for pretending that their officials say one thing in public and another thing in private.                     I was asked about apologies, and I was suggesting that the apologies necessary are by the opposition. And while they are in apology mode, they might want to apologise to the Australian people for peddling a slogan and false hope about turning boats around - something that the Leader of the Opposition did not have the courage to raise with the President of Indonesia when he met him.

  I thank the member for Chifley for his question. He raises a very important matter, and that is the gender savings gap that exists in Australia. It is a fact that women in Australia earn on average 17 per cent less than men; it is a fact that 2.2 million Australian working women earn less than $37,000; it is a fact that Australian working women are more likely to be in part-time jobs; it is a fact that women have more periods of broken service and employment because they take time off to raise families; it is also a fact that when women retire, they have, on average, in their superannuation balances $149,000, whereas men have, on average, $266,000. There is clearly a gap in Australia between the retirement savings of men and women. Labor is actually tackling this gap. I will not go on a link about what we are doing with workplace relations, because I think that everyone in Australia knows that Labor is more fair dinkum about the equal treatment of women in the workplace that those opposite. But on superannuation, too, we are tackling this gap.                 By increasing superannuation from nine to 12 per cent, Labor is giving every woman who goes to work the chance to have a more dignified retirement by increased superannuation savings. A 29-year-old receptionist today earning $45,000, courtesy of Labor's policies, will have an extra $83,000 in retirement. A hairdresser at the age of 20 earning $37,000 will have an extra $111,000, courtesy of Labor lifting super from nine to 12. It is also true to say that by Labor axing the 15 per cent tax on superannuation contributions for 2.2 million Australian working women, we are giving a lot more women the chance to have more money in retirement. That is what we are doing to tackle the gap.                 But I am asked by the member for Chifley, are there other policies? I regret to inform the House that there are. The opposition, in their reply to the budget, stunned Australian working women by saying that they are going to freeze the increases in superannuation at 9¼ per cent. Why do they want women to retire with less money? The opposition also reconfirm their great big new 15 per cent tax on 2.2 million Australian. I hope that the members of the opposition, when they leave this place this weekend, when they are having their hair cut, when they are going to health services, when they are hearing reports about how their kids have gone at school, when they are in the retail sector, have got the courage to tell these working women: 'We don't want you to retire with as much money'. I hope they have got the courage to look in the face 2.2 million Australian women and say: 'By the way, if you vote coalition, we're going to do you over. We don't value you.' Labor is the only party who wants to see women retire with an adequate, decent retirement.

  I thank the member for his question. He obviously completely misunderstands the bill before the House. That has been the theme of the day. The opposition today presented in here, did not know anything about carbon pricing even though they are opposed to it; presented in here trying to lecture about the relationship with Indonesia when they have worked to do so much damage to it. Now we have got the member in this parliament misrepresenting to the parliament and to the Australian people what the bill before the House is actually about.                 Let me be very clear with the member and very clear with the parliament: what this bill is about is ensuring that 457 visas are used only for the purpose the visa was properly designed for. That is, if there is an Australian who is ready, willing and able to work and has the skills to do so, then that Australian should be able to get a job opportunity. We want to make sure that Australians can get the job opportunities in our nation. Yes, there are times when, because of skill shortages, we do look overseas. To take just one example of that, when the Leader of the Opposition, as health minister, ensured that we were short of doctors and nurses, then it was inevitable that we turned overseas for some of that workforce because you cannot train a doctor and a nurse overnight.                 As a nation, we should ensure Australian job opportunities are there for Australians, that we never use any of this as an excuse for slashing training the way that it was used as an excuse by the Howard government, that we are investing in the skills and capacities of the Australian people so that they can get those job opportunities in the future and build a life for themselves and their families. I know that the opposition has a different view but they should be very clear about the nature of the difference. We, over here, are sitting with a policy for Australian jobs - a policy about maximising job opportunities for Australians.                 I understand that the opposition has a contrary view, and their view is that the 457 system should be the mainstay of the immigration program - that is, they want to have a system where it is always an option for employers to get someone from overseas even in circumstances where there are Australians who can do that work.                 They are the contending policies and we will be out there ensuring that the Australian people understand our policy: Australian jobs at the forefront, Australian jobs at the centre - proudly so - as we invest through Australian training and our schools in the skills and capacities of the Australian people.

  I thank the member for Canberra. We had a terrific launch a few days ago of a website that informs all members about the work of the Medicare Locals in their electorate. We had a terrific doctor from Tuggeranong, from the member for Canberra's own area, Dr Rashmi Sharma, who came along to talk about what the Medicare Locals are doing in her area, providing after hours services to frail, aged people, people whose normal doctors are unavailable, sending a locum doctor out to visit that person in their home to make it a little bit easier for them to receive the care they need.                 There are terrific examples like this all over the country, and members will have received over the last few days information about their own Medicare Local: over 3,000 front-line health workers around Australia; $1.8 billion invested in front-line services, with examples like the expanded after-hours service in Western Sydney run by the Nepean-Blue Mountains Medicare Local, a healthcare outreach service for homeless people run by the Greater Metro South Brisbane Medicare Local, and the provision of free vaccines by the Central Adelaide and Hills Medicare Local at recent children's expos to make sure we keep boosting those rates of immunisation. Unfortunately, we have a situation where the opposition, like with most of the things that we have been discussing today, said no to Medicare Locals and then afterwards said: 'Oh, we don't really know what they stand for. We'd like some more information.' We have had the Leader of the Opposition on the record saying he does not know what Medicare Locals are. So I am going to table the Sydney North Shore and Beaches Medicare Local pamphlet that shows the 26 front-line health workers and what they do in his electorate. We have the member for Dickson, who is also on the record saying that he is suspicious of Medicare Locals; he wants to kill them off. There are GP after-hours services, immunisation drives, suicide prevention, aged and palliative care, with 83 front-line services in the Metro North Brisbane Medicare Local.                     He does. He wants to get rid of it. He wants to get rid of all 61 Medicare Locals and the $1.8 billion worth of primary care services they provide. But perhaps I should not be surprised because I was very interested to read in the Australian Financial Review recently that Health will not be a high priority for the member for Dickson's party in this year's election. He says in this article, 'I've played a team game in opposition and on occasion that comes at a personal cost, which I have been happy to do.' He is happy to put politics ahead of patient care - and I table that article too. We need to have a debate in this country about health services: a party that invests in front-line services and the party of Medicare that has always stood for equal access to necessary health services versus a party that has cut to the bone, that killed Medicare once and that would kill Medicare again if they had half a chance.

  This question has been asked in a number of forms before, and I think you can tell it is the night after the Press Gallery ball. To the member who asked the question, what I say to him is we are a government that sought expert advice from an independent panel - the former Chief of the Defence Force, a foreign policy expert and a refugee expert - and we brought proposals to the parliament and the member who asked the question voted for more boats.

  I thank the member for Page for her question. This Labor government has delivered real tax reform to ensure that families get a fair go. On top of delivering our three rounds of personal income tax cuts, we have also tripled the tax-free threshold, we have cut taxes on superannuation for low-income earners and we have acted on more than a third of the recommendations of the Henry tax review. Every time we have brought in measures such as these, those opposite have voted against them. They vote against these measures because when it comes to tax reform there is only one type of tax reform those opposite have any interest in and it starts with 'G' and it ends with 'T' - that is right, it is the GST. We know they introduced it and they wanted it to be on everything in the first place. It is in their DNA to increase the GST. We have heard the Leader of the Opposition say that if they get elected he will have a tax review. You know that when a Liberal tells you that they are going to have a tax review it is really a GST review because they want to increase the GST.                 We have seen more evidence of that this week. We have seen the New South Wales government handing down their budget a bit earlier this week, and we all know Premier O'Farrell has been running around for months now saying, 'We want to jack up the GST,' and we saw him yesterday go on Sydney talkback radio saying exactly the same thing. I have even seen reports that the New South Wales Liberal Treasurer, Mike Baird, has been out there saying to the business community, 'Look, we've got a plan to cut business taxes and we're going to fund it when we get all this extra GST revenue that we will get.' Those poor old souls in the business community are out there living on a prayer. Well, this bloke is the Bon Jovi of tax reform: he has got business out there living on a prayer. But I tell you what: the state treasurers and premiers are not living on a prayer; they are living on a promise. They are living on a promise from the Leader of the Opposition that if he ever gets elected he will jack up the GST and give them even more GST revenue. We know that because that is what you can always count on from the Liberal Party. Now when it comes to the GST, Australian families will always have a very clear choice: a Labor government that will stand up against any increases or a Liberal Party who will always kick them in the guts by jacking up the GST.

  We stand by all of our budget estimates and they will be updated in the normal way. But really what's all this about? The embarrassment of the Leader of the Opposition, who is the best friend the people smugglers ever had because he came into this House and voted against a solution -                      I withdraw. The truth is that the Houston committee prepared a range of recommendations. We brought one of them to this House - the Malaysian arrangement - which would have had a fundamental impact on boat arrivals. The consequence of their refusal to come on board for that important reform has led to more boats, and he should be ashamed of it.

  I thank the member for Throsby for his question. Indeed, Sunday will be a historic day. The Holbrook bypass having been completed means that for the first time, more than a century since Federation, we will have a fully duplicated Hume Highway between our two great cities of Melbourne and Sydney - for the first time. This Labor government has got it done - 808 kilometres of it, nearly $1 billion put into the Hume Highway since we were elected - 100 per cent federally funded, the Hume Highway upgrade. It is consistent with what we have done in the Pacific Highway, where we are getting on with the job of full duplication - almost $8 billion compared with $1.3 billion under the former government over 12 long years; and the Bruce Highway, $5.7 billion, compared with $1.3 billion over the 12 years of the Howard government. This will be an exciting day for the community and a great day for the nation.                 Almost two centuries after explorers Hume and Hovel plotted a path from Sydney south to Port Phillip Bay, Australians will finally be able to enjoy a safe and separated 21st century road. Those explorers took 2½ months; it can now be done in less than half a day. Road safety will be a big winner as a result of that.                  It is consistent with this government's approach. When the Prime Minister is there with me on Sunday we can take pride that this is a government that has doubled the roads budget, that has increased the rail budget by more than 10 times, that has invested more into urban public transport since our election in 2007 than all previous governments combined - building infrastructure for the future, creating jobs today but boosting future productivity through nation-building investment. It contrasts with those opposite, who don't have proper plans and don't know anything about Infrastructure Australia and proper processes - we have seen that - who just have thought bubbles, bubbles which have all the oomph of one of the light beer shandies that the Leader of the Opposition loves so much. Their idea of a costing is to flip over the coaster and just write it out and say, 'That is our proposal for funding.' We have seen it. They do not go through proper processes. We do and that is why Labor has historically always been the party of nation building. Sunday's event will confirm that.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question and I would have to say it is not an unexpected one. To the Leader of the Opposition: what I am proud of is that I have led a government focused on jobs and growth, and what of course we have seen under this government is jobs continuing to be created for working Australians, opportunities for themselves and their families to make a life - a focus on jobs and growth. That focus on jobs and growth has informed our budget strategy. Yes, we have made billions of dollars of responsible savings - more than $40 billion in the last budget alone - but we have focused our economic strategy, our budget strategy, so that there will be more jobs. We do not accept the Leader of the Opposition's plan to cut to the bone and to drive our economy into an economic standstill and to cost people jobs.                 At the same time we are investing in the sources of growth for the future. We have a strong economy, but it is one undergoing a number of transitions: a transition from the peak of the investment boom in mining to the peak of the production boom; a transition as we look to seize the opportunities that will come from growth and change in our region of the world; a transition as information technology remakes our age; a transition as the world tackles climate change and moves to decouple economic growth from growth in carbon pollution. On these things the government I lead has a very proud track record.                 We are the political party committed to investing in the future: investing in the National Broadband Network so our nation is not left behind; investing in traditional infrastructure so that there are no blockages which prevent us from seizing the opportunities of this century; investing in our relationships in the region so that those opportunities flow to our country; ensuring that we price carbon in the most efficient way, the way that former Prime Minister John Howard believed in getting it done, so that we can grow our economy without growing carbon pollution; and, most importantly of all, having the faith that if you invest in the skills and capacities of the Australian people you inevitably build a stronger, smarter and fairer country. That is what our early childhood agenda has been about, and more apprenticeships and traineeships than ever before, more university places than ever before, including places for poorer children, and now, this week, ensuring that through this parliament we see a new way of funding and improving Australia's schools because they are our future. I am proud of that track record and we will be pushing to deliver on it for the future.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question and his focus on jobs and growth in his electorate. This morning I had the opportunity to address the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, or CEDA, as it is known. CEDA are here to participate in a rational discussion about the future of the Australian economy and, because they are interested in the facts, my message to them was that irrational threats to confidence are a threat to jobs and growth. Of course, there will always be legitimate debate about the policies to best guide Australia's economic future, but what there should not be are irrational assessments that are designed to smash confidence and to mislead the Australian people. It is important therefore that our nation recognises that based on the most recent information, the national accounts for March, we have an economy that is continuing to grow solidly, at 2.5 per cent; new business investment, around 50-year highs as a share of GDP, at around 17.5 per cent; non-rural commodity export volumes growing, and that is showing the move from the peak investment phase in mining to the peak of the production phase; and new dwelling investment showing the strongest annual growth in 10 years, further evidence of the non-resource sectors of the economy picking up.                  What we have seen recently too is a moderation in the value of the Australian dollar. Whilst our national accounts have been misrepresented in some quarters, so has the dialogue about the dollar been simple and calibrated to frighten people. Indeed, there are some people who have said as the dollar went up that it is bad for business and then said as the dollar has come down that it is also bad for business. Well, the truth about what is happening with the dollar is we are seeing particularly more growth in the American economy that is to be welcomed as an injection into the global economy, and of course that has an effect on our currency and that effect does make it easier for those in manufacturing, in tourism, in export industries to ply their trade.                 Against all of this backdrop, solid growth, low unemployment, low government debt, AAA credit ratings from each of the three major ratings agencies, we are continuing to invest to build our country's economic future: investing in our people, investing in our infrastructure, investing in the National Broadband Network, the key infrastructure of the future, and investing in a clean energy future in accordance with what people like former Prime Minister Howard acknowledged was the cheapest and most effective way to bring change - all of it designed to build a stronger, smarter and fairer Australia.

  I thank the member for Flinders for his question. On carbon pricing, perhaps I could use the following words to best describe the view of the government:                  Perhaps our most important domestic policy was the decision of the Howard Government that Australia would implement a national carbon emissions trading system.                  _ _ _                 Importantly, the Coalition pledged to establish a Climate Change Fund to reinvest a substantial proportion of emissions trading revenues in clean energy technology, and support for households most affected by the impact of a carbon price _ We hope that the new Government will take up this proposal.                 Who spoke those words? The member for Flinders did. What did we do? Yes, we did follow in former Prime Minister Howard's economic footsteps, in line with his economic legacy - that is, as a rational man he realised that climate change is real, that it is caused by human activity and that the best way of tackling it is through an emissions trading scheme. Of course, what we have legislated for is a price on carbon now which is fixed and will take us to an emissions trading scheme in two years time. So I can inform the member for Flinders that if he wants to realise the vision that he spoke so eloquently about in his speech, presumably to the Sydney Institute, in April 2008, what he should be saying in this parliament is stick with the policies of this government because that will get us an emissions trading scheme.                 On further support for an emissions trading scheme -                      the list of people in support of this policy just goes on and on.                     Let me quote the following words:                 The Howard government [in 2007] proposed an emissions trading scheme because this seemed the best way to obtain the highest emissions reduction at the lowest cost.                 Who said that? And who went on to say:                 We don't want to play games with the planet. So we are taking this issue seriously and we would like to see an ETS _                 I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his ringing endorsement of this government's policies of an emissions trading scheme. For those who are interested in reason in this debate, I know that the opposition are coming here today to rerun -                      I thought the member for Flinders might be tabling a copy of his thesis in favour of an emissions trading scheme! To the member for Flinders, in the 2010 election I spoke about the need for pricing carbon and an emissions trading scheme. Because this government has had guts and because it has had fortitude, we are going to have that emissions trading scheme. You support it. He supports it. Your frontbench supports it. You stood at an election supporting it in 2007 and no amount of shaking your heads or playing politics now changes that truth.

I have had the opportunity to talk with him about that and I have had the opportunity when I have visited with him to talk about local schools and to meet those people from local schools. I can advise the member for Bass that, just like we want to invest in and improve schools around the country, we want to do that in his electorate. We want to do it right across Tasmania.                 I do not want to see Tasmanian students being left behind as schools, for example in New South Wales, the ACT and South Australia, are improved with not only new money but also, importantly, new ways of working - ways of improving schools that we have proved make a difference - because we have done it in national partnership schools where we can say today that more children read, more children write, more children do maths at satisfactory standards because of the investments and reforms brought under this government's program for change.                 Now we want to take that program for change right around the country, including to schools in Tasmania. We have calculated with the best information available to us what our school improvement agenda will mean in Tasmania. Take one example from the member's electorate - Prospect High School: currently it receives around $7.5 million in total public funding. Under our plan that will increase by over 30 per cent with an extra $2.3 million. This will see an increase of substantial proportions because this is a school with a high number of children from poorer backgrounds, and I want those kids to get a great education too. It is those schools, indeed, every school, that I do not want to see left behind.                 For this week, the agenda for the nation, for this parliament, is whether or not we will come together to improve Australian schools. Premier O'Farrell has already proved that every Liberal does not need to be a wrecker. I am calling on Queensland, Victoria, the Northern Territory and Western Australia to sign up to our plan for school improvement and new resources. It follows from what I have said in answer to the member for Bass's question that I believe Tasmania must sign up too. This parliament must pass our legislation. This will be the defining moment of this week; a defining moment when our nation endorses a better future for our children and, as a result, a stronger, smarter and fairer country for the future.

  I thank the member for North Sydney for his question and note that in the past he has commentated on some important economic matters. I remind him, for example, of his words: 'Our very strong view is we were the initiators of an emissions trading scheme and we believe in a market based approach'. I thank him for his endorsement of the government's policy to price carbon and our emissions trading scheme. His endorsement is very welcome.                 On our economic and budget strategy, the shadow Treasurer, who asked the question, well knows that what you need to do with the budget is you need to make decisions, and they are not easy decisions, so that they are appropriate for your economy and they support jobs and growth. We are involved in a major fiscal consolidation - that is, we are making billions and billions and billions of dollars of savings in responsible changes in the budget. I do note that the opposition has waved these changes through - more than $40 billion worth of changes in the budget papers. I remind the shadow Treasurer of that. I also remind him that he has had his fights within his political party as to whether or not those responsible changes will be endorsed.                 But we have calibrated our budget strategy so that we not only improve the budget bottom line but also we support jobs and growth in our economy, because, if we did what the shadow Treasurer is suggesting, you would need to cut to the bone and that would bring our economy to a standstill. I make this offer to the shadow Treasurer: I do think that this is a debate that needs to be had clearly and accurately with the benefit of very accurate figures. The government's budget is there. If, any day, the shadow Treasurer wants to table where he thinks cuts should be in that budget, to bring it back to surplus more quickly, then he should do so. Then, of course, we will have an honest debate about the government's economic strategy versus the cuts to the bone of the shadow Treasurer. If he genuinely believes that he can bring the budget to surplus more quickly then he should have no difficulties at all tabling a document that shows tens of billions of dollars worth of cuts.                 The people who are going to feel the pain of those cuts deserve to know. So step up, table the document  showing where the billions of dollars of cuts are going to go - where they are going in Health, where they are going in Education, where they are going in payments to families, where they are going in child care. Step up, table the document and we will have a red hot honest debate about it. In the meantime, we will keep supporting Australian jobs and opportunities for Australians.

  I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. As I said a little bit earlier to the House, the dollar has been going down - that is a reflection, particularly, of market views of increased strength in the American economy. That is obviously good news for the people of America, but it is good news for the global economy. A strengthening American economy is good news for the world and it is good news for us. Those movements feed into our currency and feed into the value of our currency. I know the moderation in the value of the dollar will be very welcomed by many in manufacturing, many in tourism and many in other trade-exposed sectors of the economy.                 He specifically asked me about food imports and he specifically asked me about motor vehicles. On food imports, I can advise him of the following. On Friday the Assistant Treasurer, Minister Bradbury, and the Minister for Trade and Competitiveness, Dr Emerson, announced that the Productivity Commission would undertake separate safeguard inquiries into the impact of  imports of processed fruits and tomatoes on Australian producers. The inquiries have been initiated at the request of SPC Ardmona and will consider the introduction of safeguards measures against imports of canned tomatoes and multi-serve canned fruit products. The Productivity Commission is Australia's competent authority to investigate whether safeguard measures are justified under WTO rules. It will conduct the inquiries in accordance with Australia's safeguards procedures. Australia will notify the WTO and relevant training partners of these investigations. The commission is to provide the accelerated report to the government as soon as practicable, and in any event within three months. So that process is underway. SPC is one of Australia's largest food processors, employing more than 800 full-time equivalent staff directly. Of course it makes a very substantial contribution to the regional economy in which it is located. I can see the member for Murray, Dr Stone, nodding her head in agreement with that. In addition, we of course have made significant reforms to the anti-dumping system.                 On the question of motor vehicles, we are not in the business of mandating but we are certainly in the business of leading by example. That is why we have purchasing policies which mean for the federal government we would look locally when it is possible to do so. We have urged that on other governments, including local governments, around the nation. We will continue to support our car industry and refuse to endorse the cuts to car-making proposed by the other side of politics which would, of course, bring thousands and thousands of jobs to an end.

  I thank the member for Banks for his question. There is no doubt that education for this country is the foundation of our character and our future prosperity. The great danger that we are faced with is that, with some education standards declining Australia-wide, too many young Australians will be left behind in the future if they do not get the support from the National Plan for School Improvement to provide more resources for better teaching and support in the classrooms where it is needed.                 I thought it might be worthwhile just having a look at a state like Victoria. Too many disadvantaged students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, year 9 students, are achieving at a standard that is approximately three years below the reading and numeracy equivalent of students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds. In Queensland too many Indigenous students are being left behind. Again, year 9 students are achieving at a standard approximately three years below for reading and numeracy. To be that far behind in year 9 absolutely puts a handcuff on your capacity to go any further in the future. That is why our plan to reform schools with an investment of almost $10 billion is a matter of national importance.                  We are not the only ones who see it that way of course. The words of the Premier of New South Wales should be ringing in our ears this week, where he says, about the national plan:                 _ it provides additional resources, fairer distribution, to deliver higher standards and better outcomes in schools across -                  his state of -                  New South Wales.                 The same would apply in every state in the Commonwealth.                  So in Queensland, sign up to the national plan, see schools benefit from around an additional $3.8 billion over the next six years, or do not sign on, stick to a broken funding model and see government schools lose on average around $2.4 million per school. For Premier Napthine it is pretty clear as well: sign up, schools in Victoria benefit from an additional $4 billion over the next six years; do not sign up and government schools will lose about $1.9 million on average per school. Those figures are very stark. What is crucial, in understanding how important this is, is to reflect on what would happen if young students in each of those states were denied the opportunity for the additional resources and reforms under the National Plan for School Improvement. Bendigo Senior Secondary College Principal Dale Pearce got it right. He said simply, 'The proposed reforms are welcome and necessary.'                 That is how education stakeholders see it. So to the Premier in Queensland, who seems hostage to ideological enmities from another age: get on board and understand that it is in the interest of your students, as it is in every state, that we have better schools for all Australians and a national plan for school improvement that will support them.

  I thank the member for his question. Of course the member, I believe, knows the answer. The answer in part lies in the fact that this parliament was called upon to respond to a High Court decision to put us in the same position that the former Howard government was when it came to refugee and asylum seeker issues. In response the member who asked the question came in and voted for more boats - voted for more boats! This joins just a welter of negativity from the opposition to undermine the nation's ability to deal with refugee and asylum seeker issues.                  The opposition said no to the recommendations of the expert panel which the government has fully accepted. To the extent that we cannot implement all of those recommendations, it is because the opposition has said no and is standing in our way. The opposition said no to the Malaysia agreement, something that would have made a contribution sending a shock up the people-smuggling pipeline, but the opposition said no.                 The Leader of the Opposition has been out with a document pointing to what he claims is an increase of 20,000 public servants and saying that he will cut those if he is ever Prime Minister. I urge him to look at the details, because many of those cuts would fall on agencies involved in security and border control. Then, of course, we have seen the opposition insult the Indonesian government. We have seen -                      In dealing with the refugee and asylum seeker issues, we have not only seen the expert panel recommendations thrown out by the opposition, we have also seen them throw out the advice of defence personnel about how to deal with boats on the high seas.                  Against that track record of the negativity, what has the government done? Even in the face of that negativity, even in facing the determination of the opposition to vote for more boats, to hope that there are more boats to see their political advantage in more boats, we have gone about implementing the recommendations of the expert panel, and that is what we intend to continue to do.                     As the government continues to implement the recommendations of the expert panel, I say to the member who asked the question: perhaps he ought to provide some clarity to the Australian people - given the opposition is now shambling around unable to answer the question when it would 'stop the boats' - how on earth the opposition says it would implement the policy. We have seen the ludicrous boat phone policy of the Leader of the Opposition. We have seen the insults to Indonesia. It is time to stop the sloganeering and start dealing with the policy substance.

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for that question, because over the past five years the Australian economy has outperformed most other developed economies. We did not go into recession and we have not experienced the very high levels of unemployment and the destruction of businesses that we have seen in so many other developed economies.                 When the going got tough, we put jobs and growth first. We had the courage to take the big decisions to support our economy. The consequence of that is that the economy is 14 per cent larger than it was at the end of 2007 and eight per cent larger in the last three years alone. The consequence of that is almost one million additional jobs created, 500,000 of those jobs in the last three years alone. That is a record that everyone on this side of the House is very proud of. And it is a record that is envied right around the world.                 Because we have the strength, because we have this resilience, we are up for making the big investments for the future, in particular the investments in education which are key to future prosperity. We want to see our school system in the top five internationally by 2025. To do that, we have to get rid of a broken funding model, and that is why we are putting in place a funding model which puts our schoolkids first and politics last, unlike those in opposition. We are also making the very big investments in superannuation: building a national superannuation savings pool, increasing the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent. That will add half a trillion dollars to our national savings by 2037. If you are a 30-year-old electrician on an average sparky's wages you will end up with $124,000 more when you retire at 67.                 When you look at what we are doing with the funding of education, the school improvement program; if you look at what we are doing in terms of strengthening our superannuation, making sure people have enough resources to have dignity in retirement - all of these reforms are opposed by those opposite. They made it very clear before in the interjection of the shadow Treasurer that, had they been in power over the last five years or indeed the last three years, they would have taken an axe to public expenditure, which would have pushed unemployment through the roof and we would have seen the destruction of our social safety net. That proposition was put forward by the shadow Treasurer before, and that is the reason why they will not put forward any funded or costed policies.                  They have had five years to put forward accurate, costed policies, and in those five years we have not seen one. What we saw was their $11 billion hole in the last election. We on this side of the House will build the nation, make the investments for the future. Those on that side of the House will impose European austerity policies which will push up unemployment and rip up the social safety net.

  I would like to thank the member for La Trobe for her question. She understands, as everyone in the government does, that superannuation is a very important institution. Indeed, as Australians grow older, increasing retirement income and superannuation become even more important. That is why there is a clear and distinct debate in Australian politics at the moment between Labor on one hand and the coalition on the other.                 Labor has always supported increasing compulsory superannuation over the years - zero to three per cent in the Hawke government, three to nine per cent in the Keating government, and nine to 12 per cent in the Gillard government. On every occasion when the opposition has had a chance to vote to increase superannuation, they have voted against it. They have never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity on superannuation, I am afraid.                 But it gets worse than that when we talk about the choice between the two parties. We have axed a 15 per cent tax on the contributions paid by people who earn less than $37,000, and the coalition wants to put a brand new tax on the contributions of low-paid Australian workers. But when you look at the consequences of this coalition policy that is when the story becomes most clear.                  Take for instance, 30-year-olds in select occupations and what they get if Labor is returned on 14 September, or what they get if the coalition is elected. This is very important to the retirement savings of people. A receptionist on average wages stands to gain an extra $79,000 if Labor's policies are upheld in this nation. A hairdresser stands to gain an extra $66,000 at retirement if Labor's policies are upheld in this nation. Childcare workers would gain an extra $75,000 in retirement. Even the occupation of media professionals - more affectionately known as journalists - stand to gain an extra $156,000 in retirement if Labor is elected. This is the choice in superannuation in Australia, first of all.                 The conservatives have never liked superannuation and, as recently as last year, the Leader of the Opposition said:                 We have always as a Coalition been against compulsory superannuation increases.                     That was on 23 March 2012 - just to help the leader of opposition business. What we know about the coalition is that the track record counts. A leopard cannot change its spots; the opposition cannot be trusted to increase superannuation. If you want to see Australians retire with more income, the only choice on 14 September is to re-elect a Labor government.

  Nothing could better illustrate the difference between the government's approach and the opposition's approach. There they are mired in filth without any policies for the nation's future, the very few things that they stand for being things that would hurt our nation. Their promise in clean energy is to trash the legacy of the Howard government and to knock our economy into a standstill as they desperately tried to scrabble around to end carbon pricing. There are the cuts to the bone that they stand for: hurting families, ripping benefits away, basic benefits like the School Kids Bonus, a promise to make sure that our economy is no longer in a position to offer jobs and growth. There is the Leader of the Opposition with his plan for increased tax: putting up taxes on companies, which would flow through to the things that Australians buy, and may well cost jobs in those companies. These are the only plans that they stand for before the Australian people - economic vandalism, cuts to the bone, hitting jobs and growth, more taxation on companies - and because they know that they are ill-equipped to debate any of the real issues for our nation's future, they come in here with rubbish like this.                 It says everything about the Leader of the Opposition that he would authorise a question like this. It says everything about the Leader of the Opposition that he knows he cannot sustain a debate on the economy. He cannot sustain a debate on carbon pricing. He cannot sustain a debate on the future of school funding. He cannot sustain a debate on the National Broadband Network. He cannot sustain a debate on the economic opportunities of the age in which we live. He cannot sustain a debate on foreign policy and engagement in our region. He cannot even sustain a debate on border security; having thumped his chest so many times about stopping the boats, he knows he has actually got no way to stop the boats. Because he has no policies, because he has no plans and because he is mired in negativity, what he authorises is filth.

                    Mr BURKE                    (Watson - Minister for the Arts, Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities) (15:08)  The forestry industry in Tasmania has been going through an extraordinary downturn over the last couple of years, and that is what caused industry and the environment groups to sit down at the same table to see if there was a way forward other than the previous conflict model that had been plaguing Tasmania for about 30 years.                  It was no surprise that, once you actually had a constructive way forward on the table, those opposite said they would prefer to settle the issue in the car park. Those opposite preferred the old style of conflict so that we have had in the last couple of days two massive steps forward - one for industry; one for conservation - with those opposite opposing both of them.                  Yesterday we had the member for Franklin and the member for Braddon standing up with Ta Ann, one of the most significant millers in Tasmania, responsible for the peeler billets that underpin the rest of the timber industry, with $26 million there to allow that business to restructure itself in the wake of the new situation that Tasmanian forestry has been facing. We had Senator Colbeck describing that sort of assistance as economic vandalism for Tasmania - $26 million for the key mill that underpins the rest of the sector in Tasmania and the jobs that go with it, which is not just the people that Ta Ann employ but the people who work as contractors, for the neighbouring mills and the rest of industry. That was described as economic vandalism by those opposite.                  I am also pleased to inform the House that they have not just opposed everything relating to helping industry; they have been even-handed: they have opposed anything about conservation as well. They even took the opportunity to send their own letter, it has been reported, to the World Heritage Committee saying, 'We're not the government but we would still like you to please not go ahead with the World Heritage listing.' I am pleased to inform the House that, half an hour before question time, the World Heritage Committee have accepted in full the boundary extension for Tasmania's forests: the Styx, the Weld, the Upper Florentine, the Great Western Tiers - areas that industry had said should be part of the agreement to be taken out of production; areas that were put forward to the World Heritage Committee, not as politicians drawing a line or bartering but, for the first time, a government saying, 'We would allow the stakeholders to negotiate and we would back their position in.' That provides a path forward for Tasmania different to the conflict model that those opposite are completely wedded to - an outcome for jobs in Tasmania, an outcome for conservation but, because it involves peace, they can only say no.

  I reject the premise of the question entirely. This government has a AAA credit rating from the three major global rating agencies with a stable outlook. If you go through the reviews of the budget, and most of the analysts agree, you will see that people appreciate that our support for jobs and growth is absolutely fundamental to our future prosperity. There is only one threat to that, there is only one threat to confidence, and that is the approach of the Leader of the Opposition and those opposite. They have said very clearly that they will take an axe to jobs. Just because the global economy took an axe to our revenues does not mean that we should take an axe to jobs and growth. But that is the position of the Liberal Party in this House. The position they are putting forward is European-style austerity policies. This was repeated again by the shadow Treasurer yesterday in a speech.                     What we are seeing from this Leader of the Opposition is simply more fearmongering - talking our economy down and trying to exaggerate the impact of a carbon price. Everybody on this side of the House believes that dangerous climate change is something that should be tackled. To the Leader of the Opposition it is just: something is happening out there. Well, something is happening out there and we are dealing with it, as a responsible government that faces up to the challenges of the future. We will always deal with the challenges of the future. We are dealing with the funding model for education. We are investing in the NBN and facing up to the challenges of the future. The consequence of that is an economy which is growing which is the envy of the world, supporting jobs and growth. There is a clear alternative: those opposite would take an axe to jobs and growth in this economy, with austerity European style. That is the only threat to confidence in this country.

  I do thank the member for Parramatta for that question. When you look at the Australian economy, it is one that is envied right around the world - eight per cent larger in the last three years, 14 per cent since the government was elected. In the last three years, 500,000 jobs were created and almost a million jobs in the time that the government has been in power. This government understand the importance of supporting jobs and growth, which is why this country did not go into recession when most other developed economies did. It is because we did not go into recession that we have the economic strength to make the investments for the future. Governments should be always looking over the horizon, looking to the future, looking to tomorrow. What are the investments that we can make for the long term? We know what is important here. Education is very important - getting rid of that broken funding model and making investments for a decade's time which will lift our productivity and make us a stronger and smarter country.                 This is where the NBN comes in. Those opposite do not accept the need for superfast broadband in our economy. They have the minister for the 'copper' economy over there, the shadow minister for communications. They believe in the 'copper' economy. On this side of the House, we are preparing our country for the future. The future is superfast broadband. It is absolutely essential to lifting our productivity and making our country more efficient - the digital economy. None of these things are understood by those opposite, just as they do not understand the importance of education. Investing in the NBN is truly a nation-building project. It will drive a digital future for this country.                  Since those opposite were last in power, the amount of data downloaded over the internet by Australians has grown 15 times. Of course, we all know the Leader of the Opposition does not understand this transformation that is happening in our economy. But we know that through investment in the NBN we can drive investment in our economy and drive growth in the services sector, which is there to take up the slack as mining investment comes off. This will drive a revolution in efficiency and productivity in our economy.                  Those opposite do not understand the need to invest in this technology for the next 50 years. What they have is their 'fraudband' scheme. That is what they have got. They are going to get copper to the node, nothing to the house. We are going to get the fibre right to the home where it is needed so that people can get the speeds they need for the future. This Leader of the Opposition has been wrecking for his entire adult life. On this side of the House we are making investments for the future.

  No, it is not. What this government stands for is jobs and growth and in our time in office there have been over one million jobs created - one million jobs - and 500,000 jobs created in the last three years. We have put in place a range of policies to ensure that that continues. It would have been deeply irresponsible in the circumstances of this year's budget to come back to surplus quicker because the effects of that would have been on Australians in small businesses right around our country. So it is very clear now what the contrast is in this House between the policies of the government and the opposition. We stand for jobs and growth. The logic of their position is very clear: they stand for savage cuts to public expenditure to come back to surplus at any price and at any cost. That is the very clear contrast.                 We get this fiscal fearmongering from those opposite. They go around and talk our economy down, exaggerate the levels of debt, and what is that all about? It is all about the fact that they do not want to tell the Australian people what they would do if they were in power, which is a Newman-style austerity program, which will slash jobs in the Australian community and make massive cuts to health and education.                 We on this side of the House are proud of the fact that our No. 1 priority - it is in our DNA - is to support jobs and growth. It is the responsible thing to do in the circumstances in which we find ourselves as a nation. Global uncertainty demands that what we do is support growth with a responsible level of debt and deficit. That is an important thing to do. The contrast was there during the global financial crisis when those opposite refused to support our stimulus. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition slept right through the critical vote. He was drunk and did not come into the House. He slept right through that vote -                      I withdraw.                      Thank you, Speaker. Those opposite -                      Thank you, Speaker. Those opposite voted against the stimulus that saved Australia, that saved hundreds of thousands of jobs. There are many members on this side of the House who remember that vote. I will remember it for the rest of my life. I could not believe that those opposite could be so irresponsible to come into this House and vote against that stimulus that protected our community when global demand fell off a cliff. It was deeply irresponsible. The Leader of the Opposition was not here. He was around in the House earlier in the evening and he was witnessed by many people on this side of the House for his activities on that evening.

  I thank the member for Reid for his question and I note that by the end of this week NBN fibre is scheduled to be switched on in suburbs and in more premises in Homebush and Lidcombe in the member's electorate, as well as in South Perth, Victoria Park, Sawtell and Penrith. The National Broadband Network is being rolled out right around the country.                     I am reminded by the member for Brand that it is being rolled out in Mandurah as well. This is bringing 21st century technology right to people's homes. Right to people's homes where it is needed.                 The alternative policy by those opposite proposes fridge-like boxes on the corner of every street and then copper to the home. In the 21st century they want taxpayers to pay Telstra for 19th century technology - not that their plan has actually factored in paying Telstra for the copper network. Of course the shadow minister for broadband and the copper economy is not alone in arguing the merits of copper in this chamber. Indeed, Mr Thomas Brown, a member, is recorded as arguing in the old chamber, at the old place, 'Copper is used for greater efficiency.' He was out there arguing the case for copper, just like the member for Wentworth today. You can look it up in Hansard - it was on 23 November 1910. This bloke would have been a visionary 103 years ago, but today he is way behind. Let me tell you there were similar nay-sayers back then. There was a fellow that the member for Wentworth could relate to, Mr Mathews. He said this:                 The practical men in the Department, not the theorists, think that nothing is gained by using copper wire for short lines. Some of the iron wire lines have been in use for thirty years, and give as good results now as copper wire lines.                 You can just envisage the member for Wentworth back then with a top hat on rocking up to parliament and saying: 'We don't need this copper rubbish. The iron is fine.' Just like today he argues, 'We don't need the fibre. The copper is fine,' and just like the Leader of the Opposition sees Sonny Bill Williams at a launch and goes, 'Oh, is that Sonny Bill or is that an apparition?' You have a situation whereby those opposite are simply unprepared for the future. We on this side are engaging with the NBN because it is a part of our economic future not the past.

  What can I say? I do welcome any question on the economy and any question on investment, particularly when it comes to Australia's small businesses, because we have got in place a fundamental piece of public policy called the instant asset write-off, which is a major benefit to millions of small businesses right around our country. Of course, ironically, it is something that is opposed by those opposite and would get the axe if they were in government -                      The instant asset write-off is a major boost to cash flow to millions of Australian small businesses. I am not surprised that those opposite would not acknowledge what an important boost it is to the cash flow of small businesses, because they want to get rid of it. They are not going to tell people about it and be honest about it. Loss carry back is also very important to many small businesses. This is opposed by those opposite as well.                  I have been asked about the carbon price. The carbon price is working and it is having a dramatic impact on emissions. That is a good thing for our country. We on this side of the House understand the importance of dealing with dangerous climate change, unlike those opposite. The Leader of the Opposition has called it absolute crap. He said he has been a weathervane when it comes to climate change. On this side of the House we have conviction. We have conviction about jobs and growth. We have conviction about doing something about dangerous climate change. We have conviction about doing something to increase the resources available for the education of our children. There is a very clear contrast.                  So when it comes to small business and the rest of the business community there is nothing more fundamental that we can do for business than to support jobs and growth. Growth in our economy is solid: 0.6 and 2.5 through the year. Where else do you see those sorts of growth levels in developed economies around the world? Indeed, many of the developed economies are going further backwards. Where else do you see an economy which is 14 per cent larger than it was at the end of 2007? The Canadians are only up to about six per cent.                  The fact is that the most fundamental thing we can do for business is to make sure we are supporting jobs and growth so we have consumers who can spend a dollar and keep the doors of those businesses open. That is what drove us when responding to the global financial crisis and the global recession - to keep the doors of small business open when global demand fell off a cliff. And guess what? We were pretty successful at that. We are successful at it now because we understand the importance of jobs and growth. You do not. The people who will suffer, if you ever get the chance to take the axe to public expenditure, will be the small businesses of our country.

  I thank the member for Denison for his question. I appreciate the interest that the member for Denison has taken in psychiatric services in his electorate. It is an issue that has been raised by him with me over a number of months - and this program in particular several weeks ago - as well as by other Tasmanian members.                  I am happy to confirm, as the member for Denison has said, that I have provided the Tasmanian government with a funding offer to use Commonwealth funds for important psychiatric services. As the day-to-day manager of Tasmania's health system, the Tasmanian government will have to make important decisions about the allocation of resources, but I have put on the record that the Commonwealth government stands ready to assist. We are in frequent, ongoing discussions with the Tasmanian government. I am very hopeful, indeed confident, that we can conclude these arrangements satisfactorily.                 I also want to take the opportunity of the member for Denison's question to update other members of the House on progress in Tasmania on the health package. The Tasmanian health system is a strong beneficiary of increased investment in health expenditure. In this year's budget there will be a record $399 million from this government to Tasmania for its health system for the 2013-14 year - that is, a $29 million increase on the 2012-13 year, a very substantial amount. Of course, funding is increasing every year, including through our spending on the $325 million package that was designed to get the Tasmanian health system back on track.                 The package includes funding, for example, for 2,600 additional elective surgeries. This year, there was an expectation that we would do 745 of those surgeries. I am very pleased to say that by May we had already completed 700 of those 745 additional surgeries. That is, people have had operations on cataracts, hips and knees - all elective surgery that they otherwise would have been waiting for years for. They have been able to get the surgery sooner. We are also supporting existing programs and expanding them across Tasmanian - things like the terrific Cradle Coast Connected Care advanced care planning system, which will allow people to have advanced care directives on their personally controlled eHealth records.                 We are completely rebuilding the Royal Hobart Hospital, as the member for Denison well knows passing the building site almost daily in his work, no doubt, with a $340 million investment. Right across Tasmania, there have been developments, like the fantastic GP superclinic in Burnie that I visited recently with the member for Braddon and $36.6 million for the Tasmanian Cancer Care project. Right across Tasmania, in Hobart and in all of the cities, there has been extra investment from our Commonwealth government in supporting better health for Tasmanians.

  I thank the member for Throsby for his question. As many people listening will know, the classrooms of today are much different to the classrooms of the past, particularly for students who are online, who have handheld devices and who are clearly learning in places other than sometimes in the schoolroom. We understand that students need to be educated in the digital age and that is why the National Plan for School Improvement, coupled with high-speed broadband, can resource classrooms for learning in the 21st century.                 Think about the opportunities to connect with classrooms in Asia to deepen cultural understanding of students. Think about teachers accessing high-quality resources under the national curriculum, the Australian curriculum, one of the world's first ever to be delivered online. Think about students in regional and remote Australia, the vast distances no impediment to them learning, for example, through high-quality video interaction with other schools. Or think about students researching something like the personal journeys of early European settlers. They can go onto the National Library or the State Library of New South Wales, working in their NBN connected homes, and access high-definition primary resources, like Joseph Banks's diary, and debate with peers in a live-stream video environment. All of these things are important, rich, learning environments and opportunities for young students in Australia.                 I can see that stakeholders understand this. The principal of Willunga High School, already connected to the NBN, I should say, said:                   The NBN has facilitated a revolutionary change in the delivery of content and co-contribution of learning input. Students who used to hand in C-grade work are now producing A-grade work.                 That is what digital learning opportunities are all about. But the fact is that not all schools are on fibre and too many schools, particularly in regional Australia, are on slow download speeds. I saw the 2011 School Broadband Connectivity Survey, noting that around 40 per cent of schools had access to four megabits per second or less of download speeds. So, state education systems have to make the necessary investments in their broadband services and be ready to work with NBN Co. to provide improvements.                   Let us look at the choice in digital learning between the government and those opposite. After about 11 years in government we had around 3,000 flagpoles. We delivered support for nearly 3,000 libraries. We have the member for Sturt wrapping himself in the Union Jack and wanting to rewrite the history curriculum. Importantly, we have the coalition locked into a broken funding model, with less resources - some $16 billion going to schools over the next six years. For us, there is the national curriculum, the online additional resources for teachers, the National Plan for School Improvement and the NBN to deliver the best possible education to Australian students.

  It is sad that this question is being asked on the day we have the coronial inquiry going on in Western Australia for the deaths of almost 100 asylum seekers just over a year ago. The question should be seen for what it is, which is a pretty disgraceful piece of politicking and seeking to move the opposition away from the fact that they have a completely ridiculous and ineffective alternative to stopping the boats.                     Since May 2011 they have refused to support proposals from this government for regional processing and regional arrangements. Sadly, more boats are coming and, sadly, more people are drowning. We ought to pause there and think about our responsibility as a parliament to put in place the full range and suite of policies which can stop these boats coming and which can deal effectively with the people smugglers.                 To that end, in a responsible way, we commissioned the report from Mr Houston and his committee as to a range of proposals which needed to be implemented. The key part of that is regional processing, which was once again rejected by those opposite. They say openly to the public that they support a regional solution and they actively vote against it in the parliament. How can anybody take that mob over there seriously, particularly when their public position has now been repudiated by the Indonesian ambassador and by the Vice-President of Indonesia?                 This sort of crude politicking is repugnant. The fact is that we need to put in place a regional solution to deal with the people-smuggling model. We have been frustrated at every part of the evolution of this saga by those opposite, who will not come to the party and who are being negative, just as they are always being negative about everything in this parliament. Their refusal to support regional arrangements just shows how unfit they are for high office.

  I thank the member for Lyons for his question and acknowledge his long-term advocacy for regional Australians. For those of us who represent regional constituencies, like the member for Lyons and I, the NBN is an absolute game changer for our regional communities. It will fundamentally change the way in which we do business internationally and domestically. It is infrastructure that is absolutely critical to the future of our regions not just in terms of health and education services - or the downloading of movies, which is what the member for Wentworth seems to think is the only thing the internet is used for these days, or perhaps I should call them 'talkies' - but also in terms of economic opportunities that are available for regional Australia -                      It is critical to improving the competitiveness of our regional, rural and remote communities. The National Broadband Network removes the tyranny of distance and gives regional communities the opportunity to engage right across the world in a way that has never been possible before, developing clients and markets right the way across the globe. There are already regional communities that are benefiting from this government's investment in their broadband future. Communities like Coffs Harbour, Townsville, Gosford, Toowoomba, Bacchus Marsh and Armidale are already connected to the National Broadband Network and are benefiting from the National Broadband Network.                 But there is a clear choice for regional communities: Labor's high-speed fibre-to-the-home or the coalition's copper-to-the-home. The digital divide the coalition's policy would leave us with will be especially pronounced for those of us living in regional Australia. Under the coalition's policy we will be left even further behind. The coalition thinks it is fine to leave Australians with broadband that in 10 years time will be like dial-up is today. The coalition's copper-to-the-home policy is a dud for regional communities - an absolute dud - and they know it. Under the coalition, regional Australians will pay more for a much slower and inferior service. It abandons uniform pricing and will force people outside of capital cities to pay more. Even IT experts will tell you that. They describe the coalition's policy as 'too little, too slow and too backwards'. You bet it is: too backwards.                 Whether it is infrastructure investments in our roads, our regional rail, our ports, our freight hubs, our regional airports or other nation-building programs, the opposition has demonstrated time and time again that it has no vision for this country, no vision for the future and no idea just how critical the National Broadband Network is for the future of our regional economies and our regional communities.

  I thank the honourable member for the question. I can assure you that we do not want the immigration problems that the United States have in relation to the Rio Grande. If you want to talk about numbers coming into the United States, I can assure you that they have a much greater challenge than we have. That is partly the problem with this debate. There is a sense by those opposite -                      One of the problems with those opposite is that there is a sense that this challenge insofar as dealing with people seeking asylum is one that only this country confronts, when in fact that is not the case. Almost all First World nations have this challenge and deal with this in the way in which they have to.                 Can I also say with respect to the question asked by the member for Solomon that the one thing about this government is that we seek the advice of the experts and we seek the advice of the agencies, including the Australian Defence Force. The problem we have with those opposite is that they will not listen to the defence personnel who have suggested that the proposition put to turn people back -                      and turn vessels back on the high seas is very dangerous for the men, women and children on those vessels and is very dangerous for our own personnel on our vessels. Yet those opposite continue not to listen to the experts with respect to that advice. That is because they have total contempt for our naval and customs personnel.                 We saw that displayed by the member for Cook, who just asked a question and then belittled the brave efforts of our customs and naval personnel. I was there on 15 December 2010 and I saw the absolute courage and valour of our personnel plucking people from the sea. You think it is a joke, Member for Cook. Well, it is not a joke. The fact is that we will continue to listen to the same security agencies that were listened to by the Howard government.                 The difference here of course is that we have a Leader of the Opposition who does not listen to expert advice. He did not listen to the expert advice when it came to the global financial crisis. He will not listen to the expert advice when it comes to border protection. He will not listen to the expert advice when it comes to refugee settlement. This is an opposition who are all about slogans and empty promises, who never listen to the advice of the experts and continue to abuse and have little regard for our naval and customs personnel. This question is an outrageous slur on them, and you should hang your head in shame!

  I thank the member for Robertson, who is a terrific local member. Labor is the party of the National Broadband Network and we are the party of the modern technology-driven health system. The NBN will help us bridge the digital divide between city and country areas. With the NBN people in regional Australia will be able to see city based specialists without the need to travel long distances.                 There are so many examples. There is Professor John Wilson's program in Melbourne treating cystic fibrosis patients. It connects him as the specialist, the patient's GP, a nurse and other specialists - all able to save patients hours of travel. I met one of his patients from regional Victoria and he told me how grateful he was to have this regular contact. There is the Townsville-Mackay Medicare Local connecting a patient in Mackay with a physio in Townsville, all via videoconferencing. There is the Country South SA Medicare Local doing telehealth consults for patients with heart conditions. There is our telehealth trial in Coffs Harbour - older Australians having access to telehealth nurses and remote monitoring, including things like being able to monitor blood pressure remotely, making sure that people are able to stay in their own homes longer and stay in their own communities longer but get the medical attention they need and deserve in their own homes.                 In coming months we will be launching a new video consultation service to go along with our GP after-hours service, so if you are not sure what to do in the middle of the night when your baby has a rash you will be able to show the doctor what the problem is. We are also launching the new enhancement for the Pregnancy, Birth and Baby Helpline, where mums will be able to talk to a counsellor online about the things that are troubling them with their children. There is our personally controlled e-health record, now approaching 400,000 registrations over the last few months, with enhancements like the baby health app that parents can download.                 I think the member for Robertson will be interested in this one in particular. As school holidays come up, I know people flood to her electorate as it is such a beautiful part of the country. There is the National Health Services Directory that anyone can download and that can find a local GP, local hospital, local hospital emergency or local pharmacy. They can check the hours; ring up - 'Are you still open?' Wherever you are in the country, you can use your personally controlled e-health record and you can use the National Health Services Directory to get information about local health services.                 When the Leader of the Opposition was health minister he said that if he hadn't got e-health records up within five years it would have been a failure - a systemic paralysis. That paralysis is certainly on exhibition when it comes to the opposition's health policy. We have had an opposition health spokesperson who has not asked a question now in 200 weeks. He could have completed his own medical degree in that time!

  I thank the member for his question. Our Customs and Navy personnel that are on the vessels in our waters do intercept those vessels. The fact is that they intercept these vessels and they do a remarkable job. In so far as those that have arrived on the mainland, there were far more who were arriving on the mainland under the previous government. That means what has happened is that the capacity for them to interdict these vessels has been improved.                     The first thing to say is that they do intercept vessels, and that is in itself a very significant challenge, given the flow of vessels. We know that. I have referred to some of the really challenging circumstances that they have confronted, including having to rescue people in SOLAS situations and indeed having to deal with, as I have already referred to, that awful situation on 15 December 2010, where 50 people died when a vessel foundered on the rocks of Christmas Island. On that occasion our naval and Customs personnel went into RIBs and tenders and went to the rescue of those people.                 The fact is, firstly, that the honourable member compares intercepting pirates on the high seas to returning or not returning people who are seeking asylum. I do not think intercepting pirates on the high seas is analogous. I refer the honourable member to the former admiral of the Navy -                      The former admiral of the Navy Chris Barrie, a naval officer who was directly involved in these operations, has made it very clear that without the cooperation of another country - that is, a return country on the high seas - it is extremely dangerous for men, women and children and it is extremely dangerous to our naval and Customs personnel to do that. People who have already placed themselves and their crews at risk, who have actually dealt with these operational situations, should be listened to. These are people with many years of naval experience. That is why we do listen to those officers.                 Further to that, as the Deputy Prime Minister has already said in question time, we have a situation where the Vice President of Indonesia and the Indonesian ambassador have made clear that what the Leader of the Opposition would like to put in place is not going to work, is not going to happen. And insofar as our own personnel are concerned, it is unsafe. For those reasons I would disagree with you in making the comparison with pirates on the high seas.

  I thank the member for McEwen for his question, because it is an important one. The rollout of the Broadband Network is so important to the future of our economy and will underpin massive investment and prosperity for years to come. We have had strong economic performance. We have had strong GDP growth, notwithstanding the difficult international environment in which we have found ourselves over the last five years. We have had almost one million jobs created since Labor was elected to government, interest rates are down -                      The member for North Sydney hasn't quite noticed it. Inflation is under control, investment is strong, unemployment is at 5½ per cent, productivity has been improving. But there are, of course, pressures on the economy, particularly in the international context. We have had a strong value of the Australian dollar and there are structural adjustment pressures. In any circumstance, any government discharging its proper responsibility has got to be looking at the reforms and the investments that are going to continue to improve productivity and drive competitiveness in our economy. That is exactly what this government has been doing, and the rolling out of the Broadband Network is absolutely fundamental to our economic strategy, because it will lead a revolution in productivity. It will lead a revolution in service delivery in areas like health and education in my own region in the Hunter. It is going to be able to create the opportunity for people to access healthcare services they otherwise would have to commute to Sydney to achieve. That is already starting to occur. For those reasons it is also going to lead investments in regional areas throughout our country that will be massively important for the creation of jobs in those areas.                  We are looking to strongly support innovation in our economy by investing in the National Broadband Network. We have also announced our $1 billion plan for Australian jobs, which includes the development of innovation precincts in our economy. The guidelines for the innovation precincts have been out for some time. Literally thousands of submissions have been put in by collaborations of the business community in particular industries and particular regions with universities and other research organisations like the CSIRO. There has been an overwhelming response to this policy initiative and it has a very strong digital economy focus. This will underpin massive investments for years to come. It is equivalent as a reform to rolling out the railways, the electricity system and telephony in decades gone by. But it is all at risk from the coalition's backward looking policy to rely upon decades old copper networks that are going to place a constraint and a serious brake on our future economy growth.

  I thank the honourable member for her question. Firstly, this government is very happy with the fact that we are able to increase the humanitarian program places to 20,000. That is a 50 per cent increase, the largest increase in humanitarian program places in 30 years from 13,750 to 20,000. We have increased the offshore assessments as well as those onshore, so it is completely wrong of the honourable member to suggest that there would not be an increase of offshore assessments because of our increase to the 20,000. Effectively, your question is wrong. We have increased the offshore processing. We do that because, of course, we want to deter people from endangering their lives by getting on unseaworthy vessels. That was the recommendation of the expert panel and that recommendation was opposed by those opposite.                 With respect to the 20,000 places: the Leader of the Opposition opposed the 20,000 places, then he supported the 20,000 places, then he opposed it, and then he supported it again because he wanted to stop one of his members from crossing the floor. As soon as he managed to convince them not to cross the floor, he then opposed it again. That is pretty much the way in which the opposition leader deals with these matters, which is entirely cynical when it comes to providing humanitarian places for people seeking asylum. We as a government are very proud of the fact that we are providing opportunities for genuine asylum seekers to be provided the haven they are seeking from persecution. Just to repeat: the question is wrong; the premise is wrong. We are to increase the offshore program places and we will continue to do that because that is the way in which we will deter people getting on unseaworthy vessels.

  I thank the member for Moreton for his question. I know he has a deep commitment to Queensland's tourism industry. Whale watching is an important part of tourism throughout Australia that employs thousands of people and brings great pleasure to visitors and locals. Last century -                    The member for Goldstein                    th                   en left the chamber.                   The member for                    Sturt                   th                   en left the chamber.                     Thank you, Speaker. Last century commercial whaling decimated global whale populations. Two million whales were killed and some species were hunted almost to extinction. In the 1980s an international moratorium finally brought the slaughter to an end. We stepped back from the brink and now have a second chance to protect and learn about these magnificent creatures. Despite the moratorium, whales can still be hunted under special permit and more than 10,000 have been killed under Japan's so-called scientific whaling programs in the Southern Ocean since 1988.                     For more than 20 years Australian governments have tried through diplomacy to end Japan's whaling without success. When we came to office we promised to resolve the matter once and for all in the International Court of Justice and we are honouring that promise. Proceedings against Japan were initiated in 2010 and I can inform the House that tomorrow an expert legal team will start representing Australia and presenting our case before the court in The Hague in the final phase of proceedings.                     The Australian government will argue that Japan's so-called scientific whaling is contrary to its international obligations and must be brought to an end. Modern science can obtain the information we need to understand and protect whales without harming them. An example of this is that Australian scientists achieved a world first this year by attaching satellite tracking devices to Antarctic blue whales and minke whales. They will use this research to understand how whales feed and where they breed. Our scientists tell us that we still have a lot to learn about whale behaviour.                 Of course, Japan is a friend and our nations agree that the International Court of Justice is the best place to resolve our differences. We have many differences with the coalition, but on this matter there is consensus across the political divide. I look forward to joining our legal team at the international court. I consider it an honour to represent our nation in this case. I know that all Australians look forward to the court's judgement, which we hope will bring to an end whaling in the Southern Ocean.

  It would be a lot easier if the honourable members asked me these questions and did not embarrass themselves in the House as this honourable member has done. There is no change to the policy in relation to regional processing centres. There are children and in fact all demographics on regional processing centres including Manus. There are men, women and children on the regional processing centre on Manus right now as we speak, so the premise of the question is fundamentally wrong. But again I am not surprised by an opposition that does not care about the facts and only wants to insinuate all sorts of things and sloganeer. We have an opposition leader who really does not want to fix this problem. He says yes to a country that says no, Indonesia, and no to a country that says yes, Malaysia, when it comes to returning people safely to a transit country. That is because fundamentally this man is not a leader. He does not care about people dying at sea, he does not care about what is happening to people -                      I do withdraw. I say to the member for Bonner that if the member for Cook wrote that question he should go and complain to him, because the premise of the question is wrong. Children and other family members are indeed in the regional processing centre. The question is wrong and the premise is wrong. What I think is most important is that the opposition consider for the first time genuinely listening to the experts and the recommendations of the Houston panel's report and helping the government with this very significant challenge. That includes the Malaysian arrangement, because that is something that is absolutely critical to see a reduction and ultimately a cessation of vessels coming in this manner.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. He is very interested in what happens to Australia's part-time workers. He knows there are 3½ million Australians who work part time. He also knows there are 3.6 million Australians who earn less than $37,000 a year. Some of the occupations that these people represent include the checkout operators in our supermarkets, the hairdressers in our high street, childcare workers, people who are midwives and nurses, and receptionists. None of them have enough to retire on. Let me repeat that: a lot of Australians do not have enough to retire on currently.                 The good news for a lot of those occupations I just mentioned is that from 1 July this year there will be hundreds of dollars extra in people's superannuation accounts because of Labor, hundreds of dollars which will in the next 10 and 20 years translate into tens of thousands of dollars in retirement income because they do not have to pay the 15 per cent tax on their superannuation contributions. I will repeat that: because of Labor, low-paid Australians will not have to pay 15 per cent tax on their superannuation. As of 1 July this policy will benefit 3½ million Australians, many of whom are women.                 I was asked by the member for Deakin whether there are any obstacles to this policy. Unfortunately there is one great big new obstacle to this policy, which is the opposition's great big new tax on people who do not earn a lot of money. They want to put a new tax on people's superannuation contributions. Let me repeat that: with every person opposite, a vote for them is a vote for a new 15 per cent tax on people's superannuation. When coalition members go up to the high street in their local suburbs and are getting their hair cut or getting their kids picked up from child care or when they are shopping in the supermarket, no doubt those opposite benefit from the work of the low paid. I wonder if those opposite ever have the courage to tell 3½ million Australians that a vote for a coalition MP is a vote for a new tax on people's superannuation. I am sure they do not.                  So there is a very clear choice. When you vote for the mob opposite, you are voting for a new tax, a 15 per cent tax on their savings. Every person opposite in the coalition, do you know what they stand for? They stand for less money in retirement for hard-working part-time workers and low-paid workers. I promise the coalition that we will never give up on this argument. You have got the wrong policy, you have backed the wrong issue. Those opposite are not on the side of the poor, they are not on the side of the low paid, they are not on the side of part-time workers. We will never give up on this argument. Frankly, I do not care when you give up on it because you will, and every day you do not give up on your silly policy is another vote for the Labor government. Thank you.

  I thank the shadow minister for his question. It gives me an opportunity to make this point: the Customs' budget is bigger now than it was under the Howard government. The departmental appropriation for Customs in this budget is $12 million bigger. The budget also includes an additional $50 million to target people smuggling, including for aerial surveillance, patrolling and interceptions. It includes funding to build the 12 new Cape class patrol vessels. Our Border Protection Command has access to 18 vessels and 17 aircraft, as well as communications satellite imagery. They work very hard. They would not have to work as hard if the opposition would work with the government on this.                 This is a wretchedly difficult area of public policy. Whatever you think the solution is, we should all agree on this principle: that the government of the day should be given the power that it thinks it needs to save people's lives. That is the power we gave John Howard after Tampa, that is what John Howard would do if he were here now and that is what we have been denied by the Liberal Party, as well as by the Greens. It is a simple proposition: that the government of the day should be given the power it thinks it needs to stop people dying. We think that is flying people back. Flying people back to Sri Lanka dramatically reduced the number of people coming from Sri Lanka. The biggest cohort coming now is coming from Iran. We cannot fly people back to Iran because Iran refuses to take them. But we can fly them halfway back. We can fly them back to Malaysia and that is why the Malaysia agreement is so important. It is a simple proposition. The government of the day should be given the power it thinks it needs to stop people dying at sea. That is what we have been denied by the Liberal Party and it is what we have been denied by the Greens. We do not need questions, we do not need points of order; we just need you to vote for the legislation in the parliament.

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. This Labor government has delivered real tax reform that has given Australian families a fair share. Apart from delivering the $47 billion worth of personal income tax cuts, we have also cut taxes for small business, cut taxes on superannuation and acted upon more than a third of the recommendations of the Henry tax review.                 Of course, those opposite have no interest in these tax reform measures, because they are more interested in three-word slogans or three-letter taxes. When the Liberals introduced the GST they originally intended to apply it to everything, including fresh food. Now we see them lining up, champing at the bit, hoping to come back and finish the job.                 It is interesting to go back and have a look at the Hansard at the time when the GST was being introduced. Those opposite fought tooth and nail against exemptions that were put in place on the GST. In fact, the member for North Sydney said at the time that the biggest losers from any exemptions would be:                 Consumers, hardworking Australians, families, pensioners and disadvantaged Australians _ who will bear the cost of a complex taxation system.                  He said complexity hurts those people. We know that he has a really simple plan. He wants to put the GST on everything, including fresh food, and he wants to make people pay more tax. Indeed, there are many others on that side who endorsed his comments. But my personal favourite was the contribution of the member for Boothby. He said:                 If you exempt food, the benefit goes much more to people on higher incomes than people on lower incomes.                 Go figure that one out! He is out there on the side of the low-income earner; he wants to make you pay more tax. He wants to put the tax on fresh food and so do his colleagues. And all the consumers, all the low-income earners out there are meant to say: 'Thank you very much for that.' You can see them now - they are all out there dancing in a supermarket aisle near you, thanking the member for North Sydney and the Leader of the Opposition, saying: 'Thank you very much. Thank you for proposing to put the GST on fresh food; thank you for proposing to put the GST on healthcare products; and thank you for proposing to put the GST on education products like school fees.' When it comes to the GST, we all know that the coalition have always wanted to put the GST on everything. They tried it when they had a go last time and they want to come back and have another crack. They want to drive up prices on food, drive up prices on health care and drive up prices on education costs. When it comes to the GST, only Labor can be trusted to stand up for working families.                 Leave not granted.

  Yes, I can rule out covering the family car. That is not covered by current carbon pricing legislation. There is absolutely no proposal or suggestion by the government that it does. I think that the Leader of the Opposition is well aware that the problem with the farm sector is that there is no reliable way of measuring emissions and that means that it is not possible for the farm sector to be covered by carbon pricing. However, it is possible for the farm sector to benefit from carbon reduction arrangements. We have ensured that farming does benefit through our Carbon Farming Initiative.                  I want to pay some tribute to Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott on the design of this. It is an important way for farmers to realise additional value from their land by ensuring that their farming practices assist our environment by taking carbon pollution out of the atmosphere and storing it in the soil. We have made sure that there is a stream of assistance and a stream of funding that can reward our farmers for those best practice endeavours.                  Of course, all of that is at risk from the Leader of the Opposition's policies and plans. He is right to point out to this parliament that the government being re-elected in September will give the nation stability on carbon pricing. What he ought to do is point out very clearly the alternative, which is, if he is elected, there will be complete chaos because of the half-baked nature of his policies and plans and his plan to throw the Australian economy and the Australian nation into turmoil to try and get rid of a carbon pricing policy which he used to support, which he stood on a platform in 2007 in favour of and which he knows in his heart of hearts is working.

  I was just warming up on carbon pricing, but I do thank the member for Bass for his question because it enables me to draw to the attention of the House something that I think will be treated with delight by this side of the House and by the crossbenchers. It is that the Senate has now passed our Australian Education Bill. It is now the law of this country: a plan for school improvement and a plan for better funding of Australian schools.                  What the passing of this legislation means is that six out of 10 children in Australian schools are now covered by our new funding plans and our plan for school improvement. That is great news for children around the country: in independent schools, in Catholic schools, the children who go to New South Wales schools, the children who go to schools in the ACT and the children who go to schools in South Australia. What they will see from this government is increased resources in their schools, combined with a new way of working which we know lifts outcomes for children. We know it because we have proved it in the national partnership schools where we are already working.                  What remains is for those conservative leaders in the other jurisdictions to step forward and put the children in their schools first. What an absurdity it would be for the Premier of Victoria or the Premier of Queensland to countenance a situation where children in New South Wales had a better resourced education than the children in their schools, where the schools within their jurisdiction were subject to different funding arrangements. We need these premiers to sign up. We need Premier Barnett to sign up. We need the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory to sign up.                  So these vital reforms are not put at risk, we also need the Leader of the Opposition to turn away from his destructive plan, the way in which he is putting pressure on conservative leaders to not endorse our plans for school improvement and the way in which he is going to the next election threatening to cut our schools to the bone. Our kids deserve better. They deserve a world-class education. Six out of 10 Australian children can look forward to that world-class education because of the actions of this Labor government and the laws that have passed the parliament today. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to not put that at risk for Australia's children.

  I do thank the shadow Treasurer for that Dorothy Dixer. Growth in our economy is solid - growth of 0.6 for the quarter and 2.5 per cent for the year. We have a very strong and solid investment pipeline. In the past three years we have seen the creation of 500,000 jobs - one million jobs in the time that the government have been in power. There has been a surge in investment. All of these things indicate an economy which is in good shape - 14 per cent bigger than it was at the end of 2007, eight per cent bigger in the last three years alone.                  Of course, there are challenges in our economy and we are an economy which is in transition. But one of the reasons that we are in a position of strength to handle those transitions is due to what this government did to handle the global financial crisis. Because we handled it so well, we did not suffer the very high levels of unemployment and capital destruction that occurred right around the world. If those opposite had had their way, this would not have happened and Australia would have suffered massively high unemployment and capital destruction.                 The Leader of the Opposition could not even walk into this parliament to vote in a critical vote that stopped this country from going into recession.                     We on this side of the House are proud of what we have done with an emissions trading scheme and carbon pricing - absolutely proud. In the time that carbon pricing has been operating, 150,000 jobs have been created in Australia. So you can come into this House, as you do, every day, every week, every month, every year and talk our economy down, but on this side of the House we will take the decisions for the future - the decisions to invest and to make sure that we have a fiscal policy which supports growth and jobs.                  If those opposite had been in power when the last budget was brought down, we would have seen them bring in European style austerity policies. They would have taken an axe to spending, particularly in health and education. But they come into this House every day and say that we are spending too much, and they will not say where they are going to cut to the bone if they are elected.                  They hide behind a commission of audit - the formula of Premier Newman in Queensland. That will not wash with the Australian people. On this side of the House, we will always support jobs and growth because we understand how important jobs are to the livelihood and living standards of all Australians. When the acid was on, where were those opposite? They went missing and the Leader of the Opposition missed five votes in this House - the critical votes which saved our economy from recession. They are simply unfit for high office.

  I do thank the member for McEwen for that question. This government will always put hardworking Australians and their living standards first. That is what we did back in 2009 when those critical votes were taking place in this parliament on 13 and 14 March of that year, when the Leader of the Opposition could not come into the House and support or oppose critical bills which saved our country from recession. He could not do it. He could not even walk into this House and have the courage of his convictions to vote against those bills. But the Liberal Party voted against those bills. If they had had their way, we would have experienced a recession and we would not be in the position of strength that we are in now.                  Everyone on this side of the House is proud of what we did. We had the courage of our convictions to support jobs and growth. But we also understand that we have to make sure we put in place the investments for the future and that is what we did in our recent budget. We have fully funded our education reforms. Everyone on this side is proud of those bills which have just gone through the Senate today because they go to the heart of extending our economic capacity. We are investing in our people for the decades ahead and meeting the challenge of the Asian century by lifting the standards of education of all of our children.                  We also understand that what we need to do is to lift our national savings and that is why we are increasing the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent. We support dignity in retirement and adequate living standards for people who retire. We also understand that national savings are critical to our economic future. During the global financial crisis, it was our national savings superannuation pool that assisted all of our businesses to get through that crisis. But we need to build it up again. Half a trillion dollars will be added to that superannuation pool by the investments that we are making and the people of Australia are making in superannuation.                  As with education, superannuation is opposed by those opposite. This is what the opposition leader said just last year about superannuation:                 Well, we strongly oppose the superannuation increase. We have always as a Coalition been against compulsory superannuation increases.                 What that means to a 30-year-old on average wages, if they knock off the increases in the superannuation guarantee, is $127,000 at retirement. These are big differences in the investments and reforms we have to make to grow our economy, to give people security and to lift their living standards. But on every one of these we are opposed by those opposite. We understand the importance of jobs and growth. We understand the importance of lifting living standards. Those opposite simply want to wreck them.

  I am used to the opposition coming in and misrepresenting circumstances around the world. Now they are prepared to come in here and misrepresent policy statements by President Obama. It is quite a remarkable thing that the opposition would come into this parliament and do that - misrepresent a statement by President Obama. No-one who has followed this debate could possibly come to the conclusion that the member for Indi has come to - that the statement by the President of the United States in any way endorses or backs in the 'subsidies for polluters' approach that the opposition has endorsed. President Obama is not talking about that. President Obama, with the congress that he works with, has to take a regulatory approach. It is no secret that the American congress tried to find a consensus around carbon pricing and, because of the hyperpartisanship there - which has infected the opposition here, getting their tactics as they do from the Tea Party - that the American administration was not able to find that consensus in congress. President Obama has decided to take a regulatory approach about emissions intensity from things like power stations, not in any way an endorsement of or comparable to the opposition's 'subsidy for polluters' plan.                 What is remarkable here is that the opposition now comes into this parliament day after day and puts questions to me, saying, 'Why isn't Australia's carbon pricing scheme more like someone else's in another part of the world?' I have taken questions about the scheme in New Zealand, for example. This is a complete reversal of a major section of the opposition's fear campaign, because they used to wander around the country and come into this parliament saying no-one in any part of the world was acting. We were the only people acting. How foolhardy was it for Australia to go it alone, they used to say. That was a very strong part of their fear campaign. Now they come into this parliament instead and say, 'Can we have a scheme like someone else's?' You cannot pursue both lines of argument. Yes, we are tackling carbon pollution. Yes, the rest of the world is tackling carbon pollution. Yes, the political party getting left behind by the tide of human history is the Liberal Party. You used to be better than this under Prime Minister Howard when you believed in rational economic principles and an emissions trading scheme. Now, under this Leader of the Opposition, for a bit of cheap politics you have turned your back on that and you should be ashamed of it.                     No, it is not. But, Speaker, I would like to table a document. I would like to table a copy of President Barack Obama's remarks on climate change and I draw the parliament's attention to the statement:                   In my State of the Union address I urged Congress to come up with a bipartisan market based solution to climate change like the one the Republican and Democratic Senators worked on together a few years ago and I -                  President Obama -                  still want to see that happen. I am willing to work with anyone to make that happen.                 Stop verballing President Obama. You have got to draw the line at something.

  I thank the member for Dobell for his question. I acknowledge that he has pursued this issue for a long period of time for his community and that he is very concerned about water quality in his local lakes at Tuggerah Lakes. I can also confirm, as the member has said in his question, that as part of our 2007 election commitments we did indicate that we would provide $20 million to improve water quality management. That was done and that project is currently being delivered by the Wyong Shire Council. It is being done in two stages: stage 1 of this project has been committed and, I think, probably completed; and stage 2 is on track for completion in 2013.                 I do understand that the member and his local council want to see more work done on water quality in these lakes. I understand how deep this runs in his community because I know that of the work done so far close to 1,300 volunteers have been involved in this work and in like works around the country. That is a huge number of people who care very deeply about water quality. I can also say to the member that I am aware that Wyong Shire Council has applied for funding under the competitive grant rounds of the Caring for Our Country program. All applications submitted in that competitive grants round are assessed under the guidelines. They need to meet the criteria of eligibility and merit. That is a process that needs to be seen through, and seen through properly.                 I can assure him that the application from his local community is in that process and will be properly considered. I know that he will continue, as local member, to argue the merits of this proposal, which is appropriate.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I know that he, along with other Victorian members, has followed with some sense of concern the engagement between the federal government and the Victorian government. They know that they can now look across the New South Wales border, or look across the border into South Australia, and see schools that are going to benefit from our new funding and our plans for school improvement and they have worried that the children in their local schools will be left behind.                 I am therefore very pleased to be able to say to the member for Deakin, and the House, that the Premier of Victoria has just written to me to outline a position on school funding. I welcome his letter and his readiness to engage in this negotiation. It is not before time but it shows that he recognises that school funding reform and school improvement cannot be ignored. The Australian Education Act, as I advised the parliament a little bit earlier in question time, is now law. It delivers an entitlement to excellent school funding that every student in Australia should be able to benefit from. I can confirm to the House that I am willing to negotiate with the Victorian Premier in good faith to deliver an outcome for Victorian schools. Of course, the terms of the arrangement will be the same as the ones we have signed with New South Wales, South Australia and the ACT. The Victorian Premier needs to show that he is making a basic commitment to doing his part in investing in Victorian schools. The offer I have made is a good one, basically a two-for-one funding deal between the federal government and the state government of Victoria.                 I can confirm that the legislation we have passed provides for the empowerment of school communities and principals and the flexibility and diversity of schools and school systems, including in Victoria. I very much welcome the step forward taken by the Premier of Victoria today. I look forward to working with him in good faith to make sure that Victorian students are not left behind and that our nation is offering them a world-class education as their birthright.

  I thank the member for his question because it gives me the opportunity to talk about a range of policies impacting on small business, and in particular our whole budget strategy, which supports jobs and growth and keeps the doors of small business open. If this country were faced with the sort of austerity policies put forward by the shadow minister for finance over there and our shadow Treasurer, the doors of small businesses would be closing right around the country. Of course, as everybody here knows, that was something they were particularly indifferent to at the end of February 2009, when they voted against a whole range of measures to support demand and to support small businesses in our community. We are particularly proud of what we have done in this area and most particularly we are proud of the initiative we have put in place through the instant asset write-off - a $6,500 instant asset write-off for millions of small businesses right around our country. I would urge everybody who is in small business -                      I know the member is indifferent to the instant asset write-off, worth over a billion dollars to small businesses - a major boost to their cash flow. Certainly it is understood by small business organisations if it is not understood by the shadow minister over there.                 I was also asked about the impact of the carbon price. The shadow minister knows full well that it is paid by the largest companies in the country. They want to go round as part of their fear campaign and argue that somehow it is imposed directly on a whole host of businesses. He knows that is not true; it is simply part of their continuous fearmongering to obscure the fact that if they were in charge of this country they would take the axe to spending and they would send unemployment through the roof. That would lead to business closures. That is the sort of austerity plan they have for Australia, which they are trying to hide behind a commission of audit. There has been an experiment in this country in recent times. It is from Premier Newman in Queensland and it has produced the worst economic results of any state in the country.

  I would like to thank the member for Throsby for his question, because too often we hear these issues about climate change and action being taken in other countries misrepresented. We have heard it just a moment ago from the member for Indi, misrepresenting President Obama's speech last night outlining a plan to take action on climate change in the United States. Of course the opposition leader is a serial offender in this regard, constantly misrepresenting the action that is taken by our major trading partners on the issue of climate change - all pure deceit and mendacity, time and time again.                 We know that carbon pricing started last week in Shenzhen in China and it will shortly commence in a number of other cities and provinces throughout China. Overnight President Obama announced a comprehensive plan to tackle climate change in the US. As the Prime Minister brought to the attention of the House a moment ago, he did emphasise his preference for a market-based mechanism to deal with this issue. But, of course, Republicans in the US congress, like the Liberal Party here, have been captured by extremists who block rational economic policymaking and deny facts and deny the climate science. That is what we are dealing with on that side of the House and that is what President Obama is dealing with in the US congress. President Obama's plan includes measures to reduce emissions from coal fired power generation, to support renewable energy, to promote energy efficiency and to promote investment in clean energy innovation. It builds on the emissions trading scheme arrangements that already exist in a number of US states, including the state of California, which has an emissions trading scheme in place. President Obama made absolutely clear and unequivocal his respect for the climate science and also had this to say:                 _ I don't have much patience for anyone who denies that this challenge is real. We don't have time for a meeting of the Flat Earth Society.                 The convener of the flat earth society in Australia sits over there. The opposition leader describes the science as absolute crap. What a disreputable position for a political leader in this country, to deny facts and science. He went around the country with his mendacious campaign: Whyalla wiped off the map; prices going through the roof; we would not be able to afford anything; 'the cost of living'; 'It's going to destroy the economy.' Hundreds of thousands of jobs were going to go. 'The US is doing nothing. China is doing nothing. Why on earth would Australia be doing anything at all?' That is the deception that has gone up and up and up. The emissions are coming down and down and down. We have made a great Labor reform and your position is a moral disgrace.

  I thank the member for his question. I am very interested in the nature of the opposition's questions today, because we are scrambling around again now that the fear campaign is running out of any factual content. They used to come into this parliament and say no-one in the world was acting; now they come into this parliament and use examples of nations that are acting. They used to come into this parliament and complain about the whole of carbon pricing; now they seem to be narrowing their opposition down to scheduled increases in carbon pricing. That is a little bit interesting, isn't it? I wonder where that is going to lead to under the opposition, I genuinely do.                 Let me assure you, there are many Australians who listen to the Leader of the Opposition on carbon pricing and his plans to say that he will repeal carbon pricing. They look at him and they wonder about his intentions. They should watch this question time today.                     The opposition is obviously in a state of movement about what it thinks about carbon pricing. But against that let me say to the member: the same Treasury people - the people of the same professionalism who advised the Howard government that an emissions trading scheme was the best way and least-cost way of reducing carbon pollution - have advised this government of that fact. It is a fact that carbon pricing is the best way and least-cost way of reducing carbon pollution. John Howard knew that. The Leader of the Opposition knew that when he was on the government benches. The Leader of the Opposition has said that even when he has been opposition leader, and people around the world know it.                 To the member's question: because the rest of the world is addressing carbon pollution, we as a nation must act too, we are acting and, as we act, we act in the least-cost way. That is the responsible thing to do. Why would you want our nation to pay more than it needs to pay to reduce carbon pollution? Prime Minister John Howard did not want to do that; he wanted the least-cost approach. We have taken the least-cost approach.                  The problem for the member is he is handcuffed to a policy of subsidising polluters which increases the costs to our nation of addressing carbon pollution. What he is really asking is that every family and every business in his community says yes to the nation paying more than it needs to pay to reduce carbon pollution. It is an absurdity, a policy absurdity - a mendacious claim that has led to a policy absurdity. We on this side of the parliament stand for the stability and certainty which come from pursuing carbon pricing as legislated into Australian law, because it is working.

  I thank the member for Page for her question. This government is about making sure that we do things which will make a difference to Australia, bringing in big reforms that will improve our country now and for the future, whether it is a price on carbon, the National Broadband Network or a national disability insurance scheme. And today the parliament has passed the Australian Education Bill to put in place for the first time ever a needs based funding system to support school education in our nation. This is a very big, very important day in the history of education in Australia. It is a proud day for this government to see this reform now in law. I want to place on record my appreciation for all the work that has been done by officials here and officials at the state level and by the education sector itself.                  I know on this side of the House we have always understood how important it is to provide additional investment in school education to kids anywhere in the country, no matter where they live and no matter how much money their parents earn. For the first time we have a needs based funding system. For the first time we want to provide additional investments across the support for education on the things that can make a difference in a school.                 I am asked by the member: what will this mean for students? The fact is, it will mean focused, targeted support in things like literacy in the early years of primary school. It will mean that kids that need special support, if they have a special need or a disability, will get it and will get it in a way that makes a difference to their learning. It means that principals will have more autonomy in schools to make decisions on what happens. It means we will have better training for teachers, the most important people in the classroom when the kids come to school. And it means that we have a national plan for school improvement, agreed by state and non-government school systems, that is focused on getting us back into the top five performing nations in education by 2025. This government does not want to see a single child left behind. The only way that we can do that is by making sure that we invest in education in a way that is targeted and focused on the things that make a difference.                 They have crawled into a small ball on the other side of the House, but when I am asked what this means for students, it is now important for the premiers of states that have not yet signed up - the Premier of Victoria, the door is now open and that is welcome news; the Premier of Queensland, with some $3.8 billion of additional investment ready; the Premier of Western Australia; and, of course, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. At the end of the day this government and this party understand that a fair funding system means that every young Australian can reach their full potential and contribute to the great nation that is ours and the great challenges that we have in the future.

  I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question because it enables me to explain some of the approach that the government takes here. There are various stages of assessment of asylum seeker claims, and when people present and raise no reasonable prospect that they have a protection claim when it is clear that they are seeking, to use the terminology, to be economic migrants - that is, that they have come here for economic reasons - then we endeavour to promptly return people. For example, with the outflow from Sri Lanka, we are very promptly returning people. Indeed, we have returned more than 1,000 people because they have been screened out of any assessment process because they are economic migrants.                 Then there are some people who raise a credible claim that they may be able to engage Australia's protection obligations. I understand it to be bipartisan policy that we be signatories to the refugee convention, and if people raise a credible claim then that claim is appropriately assessed. That is, it is assessed in the same way that claims have been assessed in this country for some period. These are not just the policies of one side of politics - they are assessed by the department and then there are various review levels, including the Refugee Review Tribunal. I remind the member opposite who asked the question that when she sat on the government benches this also used to occur. Out of those processes, yes, there is screening, so that if people are economic migrants and not engaging our protection obligations we move promptly to return them.                 It pays in this debate to deal with the facts, it pays to deal with the complexity and it pays to properly ground your policies based on an understanding of both. That is what we do, as advised by experts through the Houston panel. That is not what the opposition does; it would prefer to stay with its negativity and its simplistic slogans, to come into the parliament and vote for more boats.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question and, more particularly, for the wonderful work that she does up there on the Central Coast in standing up for the needs of families, especially all those young families who live in her electorate.                 Australian families face a very clear choice in the coming election: a clear choice between a Labor government that wants to deliver the support that families need and those opposite, a Liberal Party that will cut to the bone. Labor delivered the schoolkids bonus, and that is delivering much-needed support to families. From next week families will start to get the second schoolkids bonus, which will be paid into families' bank accounts, and 1.3 million families will receive this extra money. Those families with a child in secondary school will receive $410 and those with a child in primary school will receive $205. This is much-needed assistance for families to help with the cost of school uniforms, winter sports gear and making sure that families get that extra help with schoolbooks as children go into term 3.                 We know that those opposite have one plan. They might not have many plans, but they do have one: to abolish the schoolkids bonus, to claw back all of this money - they just think it is a joke. This opposition would take $15,000 out of the pockets of an ordinary family over the school lives of their children. That is what those opposite want to do.                 While we are talking to families about the benefits we are delivering to them, I can inform the House that those opposite do not mind getting some of the family kits from the government. They are out there - the member for Hume, the member for Hughes, the member for Boothby, the members for Riverina, Calare, Grey, and even the whip, the member for Leichhardt - ordering the families kits from the government, telling everyone that they like the schoolkids bonus and how great it is, even though they voted against it and are going to abolish it. Get honest with the Australian people.

  It is a pity that the Leader of the Opposition did not listen to some of the answers earlier in question time, because I can assure him and the Australian people that as Prime Minister I am getting on with the job. That is what the government is doing.                 That is why I can come into this parliament today and say that through this parliament we have legislated to improve school funding, to invest in our nation's future, to enable every child to realise their full potential. It is a system that now applies to six out of 10 children - an historic Labor reform. It has been 40 years since school funding was properly looked at. We have worked on this patiently over five years, and today it has gone through the parliament. Yes, of course, we need to strike more agreements with state premiers. That is why we are continuing discussions. I was able to report to the parliament today that the Premier of Victoria has opened the door to those good-faith discussions. And let me assure the parliament: we will be walking through that door.                  At the same time, we are continuing to make sure our economy grows and offers people jobs and opportunity. We are delivering our Jobs Act through the parliament and we are delivering our plans to create jobs today and to invest in the sources of growth tomorrow - the National Broadband Network; a clean energy future; and innovation precincts, so that we move from the stages of inventing new knowledge to using that new knowledge to create jobs and opportunity for the Australian people more quickly.                 We are continuing to chart our nation's course in the Asian century, including me personally committing myself to an annual leaders dialogue with the President of Indonesia in coming days, because we know our future is in this region and we know that that offers our nation an historic opportunity to engage in this century of growth.                 So, whilst the Leader of the Opposition continues with his negativity, continues to hide his plan for cuts and continues to be out there with slogans rather than solutions to complex problems, we are getting on with the job of building a stronger, smarter and fairer Australia. In September, people will have the opportunity to judge who has the best plan for investment in our nation's future and who has a plan to cut to the bone and to bring our nation's economy to a standstill by cutting too hard and cutting in the wrong places. The Australian people will make that choice, and I certainly believe the Australian people will vote for a stronger, smarter and fairer future under a Labor government.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Let me go to the second part of his question first, which deals with the timing of the election. As the honourable gentleman knows, the timing of the election is governed by the Australian Constitution, and it is worth having a look at that document as it is the law that governs all Australians. Secondly, I would simply draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention to the fact that the practice of Prime Minister Keating, Prime Minister Hawke, Prime Minister Howard and Prime Minister Menzies was in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution to identify a date for an election. I will be no different to any of my predecessors.                 The Leader of the Opposition again goes to questions of timing. I would draw his attention to facts which are material to the considerations of the government: (1) is the timing of the G20 summit in St Petersburg, scheduled for 6 and 7 September; (2) is the timing of the local government referendum; and (3), for the Leader of the Opposition, is the current coincidence of the election date with Yom Kippur. I will therefore go through these issues with my cabinet colleagues. The Leader of the Opposition can rest assured there is going to be an election, it will be held consistent with the Constitution and, if he has looked at the dates, there is not going to be a huge variation one way or the other - and it is for the Australian people to decide.                     I look forward to contesting him in these elections on our alternative plans for Australia's future. Positive plans, not slogans.

  I thank the honourable member for her question. We in this country - if you were to step anywhere else in the world today, they would look at Australia and say, 'This is one of the best performing economies in the world.' However, if you stand in this chamber it is like we have entered an altered universe. And the altered universe suggested by the negative politics of those opposite is that this economy is somehow on its knees, which it is not. The basic economic data stands Australia proud. It is that not only have we come through the worst economic crisis since the Depression without going into recession, without bringing on mass unemployment, but we have also done so with low inflation levels, low interest rates for Australian working families and, on top of that, an avoidance of mass unemployment and employment levels which are the envy of the world. That is why this government and the nation at large should be confident.                     When it comes to detracting from national economic confidence, it is important that all of us engage in a positive economic debate. And having observed from the nether regions for the last few years what has gone on in this debate, it has given me a bit of perspective. During that period of time what I have seen is that every single piece of good economic data advanced about the Australian economy has been ignored, belittled or distorted by those opposite. That is simply how it has gone.                     I believe that what the Australian people are looking for is a positive vision for the nation's future.                     What they want is positive politics, not negative politics. They want us to build the house up, not tear it down. They want a government that says: 'Here are the problems we face. Face them squarely on the basis of facts, on the basis of real argument and on the basis of practical policy solutions.'                 I say to the Leader of the Opposition that if the Australian people vote him in as the next Prime Minister of Australia - if they do - there is one core economic challenge facing us all, and that is this: the China resources boom is over. The China trade itself represents such a huge slice of the Australian national economy that we are looking at one huge adjustment for this nation's standard of living in the future unless we continue to act with appropriate policy responses. That means that on productivity we need to work hard to continue to boost our productivity. It means also the diversification of our economy. It means building up our manufacturing again. It means building up our agricultural sector and our processed food sector. This is the way forward, given the challenges we now face with a changed set of global economic circumstances. This government will put forward positive solutions as to how we handle those challenges, as we have done in the past. It is time for the old politics of negativity to be dead and buried.

I would draw also the attention of the House to the multiple statements made by the then member for Warringah concerning the member for Wentworth when he was Leader of the Opposition.

  I thank the member for Page for her question. Earlier this month we announced preconstruction planning to get the Woolgoolga to Ballina section of the Pacific Highway shovel ready. It goes along with the work that is taking place on the Pacific Highway right up and down the north coast of New South Wales. I am proud today that I announced prior to question time the opening of the Bulahdelah bypass, just in time for the school holidays. We on this side of the House understand the importance of nation-building infrastructure for boosting productivity, for reducing travel times and, importantly, also for road safety.                  I am reminded of a day I had with the then Prime Minister and the then Treasurer on the Cooroy to Curra section of the Bruce Highway in Queensland. There I had a delegation, just prior to the budget when we were dealing with the global financial crisis here in Parliament House, and I met a gentleman by the name of Wayne Sachs. Wayne Sachs is the chief ambo in Gympie. What Wayne Sachs did was go through in a very human way the reality of what it is like to be an ambulance driver, whether it be in the area around the Bruce Highway, the Pacific Highway, the Midland Highway in Tasmania or any of our other major roads, where they have to see more tragedies in life than most of us. That is why I am very proud of our investment in the Pacific Highway and of our investment in the Bruce Highway. I was also proud to be with the then Prime Minister on the weekend at the Hume Highway opening, celebrating the completion of the duplication of the Hume Highway.                 We have nation-building infrastructure projects right around the nation. We have committed $60 billion in the Nation Building Program but of course as well we have the National Broadband Network that is overcoming the tyranny of distance which Australia has been disadvantaged by, whether it be across our vast land or whether it be competing with our international neighbours. The fact is that this is a government that has a plan for nation building. We have a plan for infrastructure. That is why we have put in place the Infrastructure Australia process so we get proper advice, something that those on the opposite side of the House seem to have forgotten even exists. That is why we are investing not just in nation-building road projects but also, importantly, in urban rail projects and in freight rail.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. As I said yesterday, I honour the contributions which my ministerial colleagues have delivered to Australia, and they have been strong contributions. In this place we all make decisions about whether we wish to continue in political or ministerial life or not. These are personal decisions. Those on the other side of politics will fully recall their own experiences in their own political careers over time. What I am concerned about in this place is whether we are going to degenerate into the old politics of negativity with every question raised by those opposite or whether we have some chance of the politics of hope.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. I apologise to him for not having been present for his valedictory speech. He has served his constituents well in this place. He has delivered to his constituents that which he committed to them locally - his schools and his health services - and I recall well with the Deputy Prime Minister attending various ceremonies in the electorate concerned with the Pacific Highway. When you look at the plan which the government has in place for the completion of the dual carriageway of the Pacific Highway, one thing that we will be able to look back at with pride as a government and a parliament, and with you as the local member, is the number of lives that will be saved as a result of the necessary work on the Pacific Highway. That is bread-and-butter stuff for people who travel from Sydney to Brisbane along the Pacific.                 The honourable member asked me to give a forward commitment for the next parliament in terms of particular allocations and, I think, the quantity of them. I am not in that business. However, regional Australia is etched deep into my heart. I grew up in a region. I grew up in a country town. I understand what it was like not to have a local doctor. I understand what it was like not to have a local dentist. I understand, from my experience as a kid growing up, what it was not to have secure housing, either. I say, therefore, to the honourable member that I am acutely conscious of those needs. That is why I would say, in response to the honourable member's question: regional Australia is writ large not just in my own heart but in the heart of this entire government.                  That is because working people live right across Australia and not just in big cities, not just in regional cities but in small towns as well. They deserve the same infrastructure as the city folks get, and that is why, in part, we are delivering the National Broadband Network across regional Australia. No discriminatory rules, no leaving the bush out, no leaving regional Australia out, and the honourable member's constituents will be well served by that innovation as well. In conclusion, I thank the honourable member for his great service to the parliament. I wish him and his family all the very best for the future.

  I thank the member for Robertson for her question. She is a very good local member, including to my mum and dad. Our economy is strong and stable, and Australians have every reason to be very confident in our economic future. We have solid economic growth and since Labor came to power the Australian economy has grown by 14 per cent. Our economy has outperformed every other major advanced economies over this period. We have grown twice as fast as Canada, four times faster than the United States and nearly six times faster than Germany.                 We have created jobs and we have low unemployment. We have created more than 950,000 jobs. That compares to 4.8 million jobs lost in the European Union and 2.4 million jobs lost in the United States over exactly the same period. Since Labor came to office, Australia has recorded faster jobs growth than every other major economy and we have delivered jobs growth at twice the rate of Canada and Germany and seven times the rate of the United Kingdom. Our debt is very low in international terms as well.                 We need to recognise that Australia's economy is in transition. We are moving from the investment phase to the production phase in the mining industry. This has a very big impact on our economy. This is set against the continued growth of China. We see recent discussions and debates about Chinese economic growth and at what rates that growth will continue. But we know this: the Chinese economy is 50 per cent larger than it was just five years ago, so even lower economic growth in China will continue to have a strong impact on the Australian economy.                  We need to work with industry and unions across the board to make sure that we are managing the transition. This morning I have spoken to Tony Shepherd of the Business Council of Australia, to Peter Anderson of ACCI, to Innes Willox of AIG and to Peter Strong of COSBOA and indicated that government will be working very closely with them as we move towards the transition phase of the economy. We will continue to put in place the major economic reforms, like the NBN, like infrastructure and like carbon pricing. We will continue to leave our doors open to business to make sure that we work together cooperatively as we manage this transition.

I say to those opposite that once again we see on parade the old politics whereby we scream at each other, we do not work with each other, we try and scare people rather than make them think, and then on top of that we engage in politics which divides ordinary Australians rather than unites them.

  I thank the member for Corangamite very much for that question. I thank him and the member for Corio for all the work they have done in supporting the launch of DisabilityCare Australia in Geelong. I have to say to the member for Corangamite and the member for Corio, as I have said many times, they have been fierce in their campaigning to get the headquarters for DisabilityCare Australia in Geelong and they have succeeded. It is a very exciting time for people with disability and their families and carers, as we see the start of DisabilityCare in Geelong, in the Barwon region, in the Hunter and, of course, for little children in South Australia and for young people in Tasmania from Monday. It is a very, very exciting time for people with disability.                 As part of the launch we will see around 26,000 people with disability get the care and support that they need, the care and support that they have never had before. People will also be able to have choice and control over the care and support that they receive and, for the first time, will be part of developing their own personal care support plan. No longer will we see people with disability in these launch site areas having to wait, sometimes years and years, for a new wheelchair or wait at the end of a phone for a place in respite, which has had such a big impact on the lives of families and of carers.                 We want to make sure that this time of waiting is over. There is a lot happening at the launch sites. People with disability are already ringing up making their appointments for next week. Providers of services to people with disability are making sure that they are registered. We have already had a lot of people go online with My Access Checker to see whether or not they will be eligible.                 I particularly acknowledge the enormous campaign that has been run by so many people with disability and advocates over a very long period. The celebration that we will start on Monday is a celebration of their advocacy that will change the lives of people with disability and their carers forever.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question and in his listing of the litany he skipped happily over a number of facts, including the state of our public hospital system and the funding proposals which we have put forward to fix that. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that he went on the public record some years ago to say that he believed the perfect public policy response on his part was to take over the national hospital system of Australia from the states. What I instead proposed as Prime Minister, and what Prime Minister Gillard subsequently followed up on, was an arrangement with the states whereby we would provide 60 per cent of the funding of the public hospital system in order to provide durable public funding from the Commonwealth into the future. My successor as Prime Minister then undertook a further negotiation with the states which landed that at 50 per cent.                 Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition a very simple thing? That is, under his period as health minister we saw the level of federal contributions to the public hospital system go down and down and down. Therefore, when the states around Australia said that there was a problem with the hospital system, it was necessary for the Commonwealth to step in and we did.                   The member for                    Sturt                    then left the chamber                     And so, Speaker, I would simply say this: under the Leader of the Opposition, when he was minister for health, the relative real contribution by the Commonwealth to the public hospital system of Australia went down and down and down. That is a statistical fact which once again, if the Leader of the Opposition is happy to do so, I would be happy to debate with him one day at the National Press Club. That is: what are the relative funding and contributions by us as opposed to them for the public health of the Commonwealth? I would welcome a debate on public policy, welcome a debate on the future of the health system, welcome a debate on the future of the education system, welcome a debate on the future of the economy and on broadband. I would welcome a debate on national security, but all we get here is politics, politics, politics - the old politics of simply negative interjections and invective as opposed to building a constructive argument for one vision for Australia's future versus anything else he may choose to offer. We are on the side of a positive plan for Australia's future. I wish he would join the bus.

  I thank the member for her question and for her longstanding interest in national security matters. North Asia is, of course, extremely important to Australia. Some of our largest trading partners are there: China, Japan, the Republic of Korea. We also have some of our most important bilateral military-to-military and defence-to-defence relationships there and we have grown these relationships in recent years.                  With China, for example, we are one of a very small number of countries that for the last 15 years has had a strategic dialogue with China at the level of Chief of the Defence Force and Secretary of the Defence Department. In the last two years we have engaged for the first time on mainland China with exercises with the PLA. We have also exchanged navy ship visits and engaged in live firing exercises. This is deeply important and is consistent with the strategic analysis you find in the 2013 white paper - that stability and security in North Asia is equally important for prosperity.                 When it comes to Japan, we have substantially enhanced the defence-to-defence relationship and the strategic relationship that we have with Japan over the last decade. Now with Japan, for example, we do a 2+2 meeting in defence and foreign ministers' format. We also engage now at ministerial level with Japan at the trilateral level - Australia, Japan and the United States at both foreign ministerial and defence ministerial level. I conducted the second defence ministerial trilateral discussions at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore recently. I will be visiting Japan next week for what will be my eighth or ninth visit to Japan as a government minister, either foreign or defence, reflecting the strategic importance of our relationship with Japan.                 As far as Korea is concerned, we have substantially grown our defence-to-defence and military-to-military engagement with the Republic of Korea. We have stood shoulder to shoulder with the Republic of Korea in the face of provocation from North Korea, the DPRK. Next week in Seoul, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Bob Carr, and I will conduct a 2+2, a foreign minister and defence minister strategic meeting, giving our relationship with the Republic of Korea the same national security and strategic architecture as with the 2+2 with the United States, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, and one other that currently escapes me. The 2+2 with Korea will be an important addition to the discussions that we have, consolidating and underpinning the importance of North Asia to our economic circumstances, our prosperity and our strategic -

  I thank the member for North Sydney for his question. I know his deep concern for the state of our economy. We have discussed this many times privately and publicly over a long period. I will be discussing the general state of the budget and the state of the economy, including new international challenges -                      such as the China resources boom, when the new cabinet meets. I assume that will be early next week. Over the course of the weekend, I intend to obtain Treasury briefings to update myself on the current budgetary circumstances. That is the proper and methodical way to go through important considerations and that is what I intend to do. Also, I remind the member for North Sydney about how strong our economic fundamentals are. Therefore, when those opposite, as I have observed from a distant place over the last few years, engage in a constant attack on the levels of debt and the levels of budget deficit in this country, frankly, they have never answered this very simple question: if it is so bad, why do the world's three major credit ratings agencies give Australia a AAA rating? Member for North Sydney, answer that one for me.                    The member for Higgins then left the chamber.                     All three global ratings agencies - Fitch, Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, which are not sub-branches of the Australian Labor Party and do not work for the cause of international socialism - have separately looked at our level of government debt and our level of budget deficit, and have judged it to be one of only eight countries in the world worthy of a AAA credit rating.                  Again to the member for North Sydney, as he seeks to drill in on questions of the budget and budget integrity, how does he answer that proposition? I put it to him once during a television debate and all I heard was a bit of spluttering at the other end. We still have not had an answer to that simple proposition. It is not us saying it; it is the international credit agencies saying it. The reason for it is that it is true. The finances of this country are in first-class working order and he knows it.

  I thank the member for Deakin for his question. He and the whole of the Labor Party are interested in superannuation. Superannuation is a great Australian achievement and it is one that this side of politics can take some justifiable pride in. If the labour movement and the Labor Party had never championed universal compulsory superannuation we just would not have superannuation in this country. Superannuation delivers on the national pool of savings. Superannuation has delivered jobs in this country. Compulsory universal superannuation means that millions of Australians can look towards older age with a greater prospect of a decent retirement.                  Superannuation, the great Labor idea, championed by Labor members of parliament, championed by the trade union movement, has meant that many Australians can work hard and have the prospect of a peaceful and dignified retirement. I can report that the national pool of savings in this country now is $1.6 trillion. That makes us the envy of many other countries. On 1 July this year, after 12 or 13 years of delay, superannuation is going to go up again and 8½ million Australians will be the beneficiaries of this government's work. I can also say that on 1 July the concessional caps for people over 60 will increase.                  People over 60 who have the opportunity to put a bit more into the super will be able to do so. I can also report that after 1 July, 3½ million Australians who earn less than $37,000 will be getting rebates into their superannuation because it is the Labor government who abolished the 15 per cent tax on superannuation contributions. So there are a lot of good things about superannuation and there is a lot to be pleased about. It is because we have a Labor government with a plan and vision for superannuation.                 The electorate know at the next election that there is one party which supports universal, compulsory superannuation. There is one party in Australia that supports increasing superannuation so that many can have a proper retirement. There is one party in Australia that supports the idea that low-paid workers should not have to pay a 15 per cent tax on the superannuation contributions. And lest anyone be confused about which party of Australian politics stands for universal, compulsory superannuation, it is the Labor Party.

  I would say to the honourable member, thanking him for his question regarding carbon pricing, that carbon pricing has been a policy of this government since I went to the election in 2007. It was also, I seem to remember, the policy of those opposite. I might have had a little memory lapse there but I seem to remember Mr Howard and various other ministers including the member for Wentworth standing up to defend the importance of carbon pricing through an emissions trading scheme. The honourable members opposite will know I have long been committed to a carbon price and I would say -                      The Leader of the Opposition refers to the two occasions on which he, on behalf of the opposition, voted against an emissions trading scheme in this House despite the fact that they went to the previous election with exactly such a policy. I would argue in terms of some policy consistency that those opposite have a little bit to explain on this question. Carbon pricing is now becoming more and more of a global reality. Mention has been made in this place already of the actions being taken in the People's Republic of China and this is important in terms of the debate traditionally raised by those opposite about global competitiveness.

  I thank the member for Makin for the question. He has been a very strong advocate for the Murray River in particular and for the Murray-Darling Basin. This government is very proud to have been a government that finally developed a plan for the Murray-Darling Basin. I remember at a community cabinet about five years ago the Prime Minister referring to the Murray as having been over-allocated to death. And yet we have a situation now where that same Murray-Darling Basin is being restored to health. I am very pleased as well that the question comes from the member for Makin who played a significant role in the Windsor committee. The Windsor committee was critical in making sure that we could get the support of this parliament on this issue.                  It is also the case that there are two further pieces of information that I am very pleased to report to the House. Members will be aware that the final environmental outcomes we wanted to achieve were those commensurate with 3,200 gigalitres of water. I am pleased to report we have now passed the halfway mark on held water, with 1,638 gigalitres now held and able to be used to restore a system to health; where irrigation is done to help the environment not simply as a cost to the environment. It is also the case that we have had to make sure that we get the states working on the implementation part of the strategy. There are major projects set to happen up and down the basin as part of the implementation to make sure that we can maximise the environmental outcomes in some ways to find ways of bridging the gap through methods other than buyback as well.                  I reported previously to the House that Victoria and the ACT and, obviously, our government have signed up to the intergovernmental agreement. I am pleased to advise the House that shortly before question time I received a phone call from the Premier of South Australia to say that South Australia is now also ready to sign on to the intergovernmental agreement. That means projects such as those at Chowilla to make sure that new regulators are put in place can happen, so that when irrigation and events for the environment happen there the water is held on the floodplain for a longer period, restoring a broken system to health, turning the corner on what had been a century of degradation. This is one of the proud reforms of this parliament and of this government, something that has been worked on for a long time. This is something which the member for Makin and the other South Australian members in particular, on this side and those across the parliament who worked on the Windsor committee, are able to say is an occasion where we have achieved something that had eluded our nation for a century.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. It is worth noting that in the period of the Howard government about 250 boats arrived on Australia's shores, of which the Howard government turned back four to Indonesia. Secondly, before honourable members get too excited about this let me just be quite direct about this matter. Prior to the 2007 election, I indicated -                      that we would seek to turn boats back. The Leader of the Opposition, if he is elected to be Prime Minister of Australia, will be advised by the officials, the security agencies and the Australian Navy that that is simply not possible under current circumstances. The reason for that is the Indonesian government has made it absolutely plain on the public record. I quote the Indonesian ambassador, who I understand has recently been a dinner companion for the member for Curtin. The Indonesian ambassador came out and said:                 It's not possible for the Coalition to say that it has to go to Indonesia, back to Indonesia, because Indonesia is not the origin country of these people _ no such collaboration will happen between Indonesia and Australia and bring back the people to Indonesia.                 Last time I looked at diplomatic practice, ambassadors spoke on behalf of their countries. That is what the Indonesian ambassador said not years ago but on 31 May 2013. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that if we are having a serious debate in this country about asylum seekers then it should be a debate about policies which work, as opposed to slogans which sound good. That is what is important here. Those opposite know for a fact that the Indonesian ambassador and, through him, the Indonesian government, will not cooperate with the policy which the Leader of the Opposition advocates.                 In the period ahead I will be taking briefings from the national security community about what further can be done in this area. I say to the Leader of the Opposition - and this is a genuine invitation to him - that if he wants to engage in a real policy discussion and provide real policy solutions which could work on the high seas to deal with this problem confronting not just Australia but also countries around the world, I would urge him to take a briefing from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, to take a briefing from ASIS and to take a briefing from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, the Department of Defence, the Australian Navy and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.                 This is absolutely how proper policy making works: facts are presented, alternative policies are produced and then you get on with the business of implementing a policy. It is quite different to simply stand up and use slogan and invective as if it were a substitute for policy. The easiest thing to do in this parliament is to stand up and use invective. The hardest thing to do in this parliament is to put forward a policy plan which works for the nation.                     No, I was not, Speaker, because I have been briefed on these things many times before. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: read the transcript of the advice from the Chief of Navy in Senate estimates and, on top of that, do what any other responsible alternative Prime Minister does and take briefings from the intelligence community, from ASIS, from ASIO, from the Defence department and from the services. Or is he frightened of facing the facts?

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. Members may be aware that earlier this week we saw a really appalling attack on our early childhood workforce when conservative commentator Judith Sloan, in a blog, labelled our childcare workers as 'dimwits' and said that they came from 'second-rate' universities, and then defended those comments on national television.                 I want to make it very clear right here that we know that our workforce is made up of passionate, dedicated and qualified early childhood educators. They are early childhood educators to whom we owe much. We know that all of the research shows that these professionals are, in fact, shaping the lives of our children in their critical early years - and they must be recognised, they must be valued and they must be rewarded for that hard work that they do.                 Earlier this week this House voted on the question: do we support more early childhood professionals earning more in return for the hard work that they do? I am incredibly proud that this side of the House voted a resounding yes to that question. We know that there are already many educators who are earning above award rates through their centres' enterprise agreements, and we support that. But what we want to do through the $300 million Early Years Quality Fund is ensure that we support more long-day care services to be able to pay their staff more and to keep child care affordable for the parents who are using that centre. This obviously benefits the staff but it also benefits those children - and it benefits the parents knowing that they are dropping their children off with staff members with whom they have ongoing relationships, trusts and bonds. This is another part of the positive plan that we have for modern Australia. It builds on the very real reforms that we have made in this sector and across the childcare industry.                 We know that there are two camps when it comes to early childhood education and care. There are those who hold offensive, outdated views and label our workers as a babysitting service, and there is Labor - Labor who has tripled funding to the sector; Labor who has increased affordability of child care; Labor who has lifted the quality of care; and Labor who is making sure that more educators earn more money. We cannot risk turning back the clock on this sector. We are proud of the very real reforms that we have put in place for the benefit of children and parents right across Australia.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. Any industrial accident in Australia is one accident too many. Any industrial death in Australia is one death too many. Each year we have thousands of such deaths across Australia and those four that the honourable member referred to were a source of enormous grief to their families and loved ones. As for the insulation program, the honourable member will be familiar with the extensive debate which occurred in this chamber in the previous parliament.                     Thank you very much, Speaker. I thank again the honourable member for his question because it deals with industrial deaths which came directly out of an Australian government program. There are industrial deaths which occur in this country, regrettably, every week. We are concerned about workers who die in their place of employment - and I know there are many members here who come from the trade union movement who have been engaged in this all their lives. I regret any industrial death which occurs in this country including the four that you have just referred to.

  Thank you for that question. We are building a health system for the future and I am proud of what we have achieved in the last few years, firstly with Nicola Roxon, who did such a fine job with plain packaging and other aspects of the portfolio. More recently I have been proud of my own achievements. We are building a health system for the future.                  We are committed to delivering the best possible health care to patients at an affordable price. We are the party of Medicare. In fact, we love Medicare so much we had to introduce it twice because they killed it the first time. We are the party of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme that delivers affordable medicines for Australians. We have added $5 billion worth of new medicines since 2007 to the PBS. We are the party that believes universal health care is a basic right for all Australians.                 What does that mean for the future? So far, since we came to government in 2007, there have been 11,000 more doctors in Australia. There are not the shortages that we had when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister when he capped doctor training numbers. There are more hospital beds. We have promised 1,300 extra hospital beds with about 800 of those delivered so far. There is less waiting. We have injected billions of dollars into rebuilding our hospitals, new emergency departments and new beds for elective surgeries and we are seeing the results of that now. Under health reform we have guaranteed an extra $16.4 billion of funding between now and the end of the decade. We have put $3.4 billion into rebuilding our public hospitals to prepare them to move to activity based funding. This huge reform means hospitals will be funded more when they treat more patients. We are encouraging them to look after more people, do more elective surgery, deliver more babies, replace more hips.                 On 1 January, Grow Up Smiling will start with $2.7 billion to ensure that for Australian children it will be as easy to go to the dentist as it now is to see a GP - 3.4 million Australian children living in family tax benefit part A families will find it as easy to go to the dentist as it now is to go to the GP. They will grow up with better teeth. On 1 July we are also providing the next lot of funding for public dental services, another $1.3 billion to build on the hundreds of millions that we have spent on reducing public dental waiting lists already.                 We are going to continue to invest in improving bulk-billing rates that hit historic lows under the Leader of the Opposition when he was the health minister. We have built a stronger health system and will continue to build a stronger health system because we believe that all Australians deserve a decent health system.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, and I can inform him - and I can inform this parliament and the Australian people - that this is a government that is carefully, steadily, purposefully and methodically implementing the commitments that we made to the Australian people at the election. That is precisely what we are doing. We said we would stop the boats, and they are stopping. We said we would get the budget under control, and that is happening, through the Commission of Audit. We said we would build the infrastructure of the 21st century, and that is precisely what we will be doing, in conjunction with the states and territories.                 Most importantly, we said we would scrap the toxic taxes the members opposite put in place, and that is precisely what we will do. We will get rid of the toxic taxes that members opposite put in place without any mandate whatsoever. We have an absolutely clear mandate to repeal the carbon tax, to repeal the mining tax, and that is precisely what we will do.

  I thank the member for Forde for his question, and I welcome his return to the House. And I observe that the Australian people, the voters of Forde, are people of discernment, and substance beats celebrity every time.                 This is the first working day of the new parliament, and straightaway the government is getting down to business. We are getting down to business, which is exactly what the public would expect from a government that said, on election night, that this country is once more open for business, because it is under new management. The repeal of the carbon tax should be the first economic reform of this parliament. That is what this parliament should do. As its first contribution to economic reform it should repeal the carbon tax. Repealing the carbon tax will make jobs more secure. It will make businesses more competitive, it will make households more prosperous and it will make our economy so much stronger. It will do all that, and it will help the environment.                 If you look at the former government's own figures, Australia's emissions were going up, not down. They were going up by eight per cent, not down by five per cent - notwithstanding a carbon tax that members opposite wanted to raise to $38 a tonne by 2020. Repealing the carbon tax will save the average Australian household, including the households of Forde, $550 a year. Repealing the carbon tax will cut $200 off people's power bills. It will cut $70 off people's gas bills. The carbon tax is not an environmental benefit; it is purely and simply an economic cost. That is why it must go. We have a mandate to repeal the carbon tax. The government had no mandate to introduce it in the former parliament. That is why it must go.                 It might help the House to know that the Canadian government today issued a statement 'applauding the decision by Prime Minister Abbott to introduce legislation to repeal Australia's carbon tax': this decision 'will be noticed around the world and sends an important message.'

  I understand that the Leader of the Opposition has a job to do, but the problem with that question is that it was based on a farrago of falsehoods.                     Yes, we are proposing to remove the schoolkids bonus - but we were perfectly up front with the Australian people before the election. We did not hide the bad news from the Australian people before the election, unlike members opposite, who did precisely that: hid the bad news from the Australian people before an election - most notoriously when they said there would be no carbon tax under their government and there was.                 The Leader of the Opposition says that we have cut assistance for bushfire victims. We have not. Australian disaster recovery payments have been made to people who were severely affected by that disaster.                 The Leader of the Opposition claims that we have cut jobs at the CSIRO. Management of the CSIRO is a matter for the management of that organisation. It is as simple as that.                 This all comes pretty rich from members opposite who, having said for ages that they were going to be the absolute protectors of the Australian Public Service, put policies in place that are now resulting in thousands of redundancies across the Australian Public Service.

  What an outstanding new member for Corangamite! I suspect she will be the best member for Corangamite in at least seven years! She is also someone who is deeply concerned about the fate of the people of Corangamite and their jobs - unlike the previous Labor member.                 Of course, we did inherit an economy that has been heading in the wrong direction. Economic growth has been below trend, unemployment has been rising, the terms of trade have been coming down, and we inherited a budget that is in a complete mess. Only a few months ago the member for Lilley stood at this dispatch box and said, 'Don't worry; we're going to have an $18 billion deficit this year.' Then, a few weeks later, along comes the member for McMahon and says, 'Don't worry; we're going to have a budget deficit of $30 billion this year.' It seems to be an odd and rather eerie consistency from Labor that they always underpromised and overdelivered when it came to deficits and debt.                 But I would say to the Australian people: there is a better way. The member for Corangamite knows this, and the Australian people recognise that there is a better way. Today Westpac Institutional Bank released their consumer sentiment indicator, which illustrated that it is at the highest reads since the December period in 2010. We welcome that. We think it is hugely important. And that is on the back of a Dun &amp; Bradstreet business expectation survey for November that shows company profit expectations have reached a 10-year high. We see that as a good thing. And the NAB business survey for October shows that business confidence remains higher than over the previous three years. And retail spending in September was better than expected, with a rise of 0.8 per cent. We see that as a good thing, because Australian consumers and Australian businesses know that, under the coalition, there is a plan for a stronger economy. And that involves getting rid of the carbon tax, getting rid of the mining tax, getting rid of the CEFC and dealing with the mess that we inherited - and, Lord knows, we inherited a mess.                 Prime Minister, colleagues: the Labor Party are like a really bad tenant - they trash the joint and now they are trying to stop us repairing the house. Enough is enough. The Australian people know that we will deliver better, that we will deliver a stronger economy. The bottom line is that Labor have got to get on track, back our changes, get rid of the taxes and help us to fix their mess.

  I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. What matters here is stopping the boats. That is what matters. I would have thought that members opposite, having failed so lamentably to stop the boats over the previous five years, would perhaps have a little respectful silence on some of these issues.                     Again, I do thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. The fact is that we are talking to Indonesia about a whole range of measures. We are cooperating closely with the Indonesian government at every level to stop the boats. That cooperation is close and getting closer all the time. What we are specifically talking about is how we can best handle the question of people who are picked up by Australia in the Indonesian search-and-rescue zone. I know members opposite like to identify failure very quickly here, but let me just reassure members opposite that while the boats have not yet stopped they certainly are stopping. In the first two months of the new government, illegal arrivals were down 75 per cent on the last two months of the former government, and in October illegal arrivals by boat were down 90 per cent on the peak month of the former government.

  I thank the member for his question and I refer him to the advice of the CSIRO, which is a very reputable body. It says that no one weather event should be attributed to climate change. That is the advice of the CSIRO - that no particular weather event should be attributed to climate change.                 If I may, for the benefit of the member, say, the government accepts that climate change is real and that humanity does make a contribution, but the important thing is to take strong and effective action to deal with it. The problem with the former government's carbon tax policy is that under the carbon tax our domestic emissions were going up, not down. Under this government's Direct Action policy we will deliver a five per cent cut in emissions by 2020. We are taking strong action. The former government, aided and abetted by the member in question, was introducing a policy of socialism masquerading as environmentalism.

  Madam Speaker, I commence by commending you on your elevation to the speakership and also commend the member for Bass on his maiden speech in this place today. The member for Bass is someone who has spent a lifetime on issues of sovereignty of Australia and it is important that we acknowledge his service, not only that which he commences in this place but his great service to our nation over many years.                 The good news I have to report to the member for Bass is that for the first time in five years, since the previous government dismantled the measures that worked, the Australian government once again has the upper hand over the people smugglers. Not only are illegal arrivals down by 75 per cent in the first eight weeks of Operation Sovereign Borders coming into being but we are stopping more people coming through the region to this country, than are arriving, by a factor of 100 per cent. More people are being stopped coming through the region through our active cooperation - in particular, with Indonesia but also with Malaysia and all the way up through the region and back to source countries - and it is this combination of measures which is producing what is a very successful early result.                 We said when we were in opposition and campaigning at the last election that we would make a difference from day one - and a 75 per cent reduction in the first eight weeks, I would say, is a good start. But it is not a final outcome and it is not the outcome we are seeking. The outcome we are seeking is the outcome that was achieved by the Howard government - that was the last government to stop the boats - and as each week passes we hope to see better results. But we are in the most dangerous period of all now, as we lead into the monsoon period. That means we need to be constant and ever-vigilant in our efforts.                 These efforts have not only benefited Australia but also have benefited our good partner Indonesia. I can report, based on UNHCR figures, that since the election of this government the number of people coming into Indonesia has fallen from 1,638 people to 602. At the end of September, I should stress - one month after the new visa-on-arrival measures were in place in September - the figure was still 1,602. So in the month of October we saw a dramatic reduction of over 1,000, since the peak.                 These are results that the government will continue to work on and continue to strive to get better. There is no single measure. We have increased our returns from our offshore-processing centres by 100 per cent. Removals from our offshore-processing centres that were occurring before the change of government and the start of Operation Sovereign Borders, and afterwards, have increased by 100 per cent. The progress is good. There is more work to be done.

  I thank the member for his question. This government is not running a shipping news service for people smugglers. As promised, we are running a military-led border security operation. As I just said, it is stopping the boats. Operation Sovereign Borders was established with clear communication protocols designed by the Joint Agency Task Force led by Lieutenant General Campbell to support the effectiveness of that operation.                 Before the election, the coalition made it crystal clear that communications protocols for Operation Sovereign Borders would be determined by the Joint Agency Task Force, and that is exactly what we have done. These procedures are designed not to advantage people-smugglers, by restricting the official information available to those people-smugglers. People-smugglers use official information provided by governments, especially when that information is specific, to sell and promote their product and create perceptions amongst potential illegal entrants.                     I can understand why the Manager of Opposition Business is fairly sensitive on this issue, as he holds the record for the highest number of illegal maritime arrivals in the nation's history.                 But specific information, as I was seeking to explain, is used. It was used in the information that was provided by the previous government to provide an official proof of voyage for payment. It can also be used to decipher the posture of border protection assets. And it can be used to identify potential client pools, especially when nationalities are referred to.                 I am not going to be part of a process, as a minister, that helps people-smugglers. I have spent the past four years dragging the previous government, kicking and screaming, towards restoring measures that they abolished, leading to chaos, cost and tragedy, to 50,000 illegal arrivals on more than 800 boats. There is a protocol in place. It has been put in place by the Joint Agency Task Force, headed up by Lieutenant General Campbell. I am not going to violate a process and undermine an operation that is stopping the boats. I am not going to assist people-smugglers, as those opposite are urging me to do. We are going to hold the line, we are going to protect the borders, we are going to make sure those borders are secure and we are going to make sure those boats are stopped. Each time members opposite wish to bring these matters into this place, I will remind them of the carnage they delivered on our borders.

  Madam Speaker, may I congratulate you on your appointment. I am sorry to say that the carbon tax has not been terminated, despite what some would have led the Australian people to believe before the election. I am sorry to say that there are those who still oppose termination of the carbon tax, despite giving lip-service to the pretence that they would support it. I am sorry to say that the member for Hughes is absolutely correct in his assessment of the impact of the carbon tax on Macquarie Generation.                 Let me quote from the New South Wales Auditor-General's report to parliament. Do you know what the Auditor-General reported to parliament in New South Wales on the impact of the carbon price? They reported:                 The introduction of the Australian Government's Clean Energy Act 2011 (the Act) resulted in the Corporation -                  that is Macquarie Generation -                  incurring a net carbon tax expense of $299 million in 2012-13. A $1.0 billion write down -                  I just want to repeat that: 'a $1 billion write-down' -                  to the value of its infrastructure assets in 2011-12 _                 So those on the other side of the House led to a $1 billion write-down in the value of a public asset. That goes to the ability of New South Wales to help deal with funds for hospitals, for schools and for community services. They are responsible through their carbon tax. So not only does the carbon tax have an electricity effect; it also has a community effect.                 There is a better way - the member for Hughes is right. We will repeal the carbon tax. That will have a $550-a-year impact on Australian households. You are standing between Australian households and that $550. It will have, according to the Australian Treasury, a $200-a-year impact on electricity bills. According to the Energy Supply Association, those costs will be reduced as soon as the Australian parliament passes the legislation and it comes into effect. According to Rod Sims of the ACCC, what goes up can come down just as quickly. It is absolutely clear that we can reduce the electricity bills of Australian families. It is absolutely clear that the former government did enormous damage, not just to the competitiveness of Australian business and not just to the cost of living for families but also to the value of public assets for New South Wales. You should hang your heads in shame and get out of the way of repealing the carbon tax.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. It is very well known that we opposed the former government's stimulus package back in 2009 because, as we said, it was too much too soon. But on, I think, five occasions - or was it four occasions -                      This opposition, when they were in government, proposed on numerous occasions to raise the debt ceiling because they were addicted to debt and deficit. That is one of the many reasons why people wanted them out. While we always criticised their policy, while we always opposed the policy of debt and deficit, we never, when I was the leader, voted against it in the parliament.

  I thank the member for Higgins for her question on the self-education expenses cap which the previous government decided earlier this year they would introduce on deductible expenses for legitimate education. This was a classic act of self-harm and it damaged the education sector. The previous government decided that they would take funding from the university sector to fund increases in spending on schools. They made a number of serious cuts to the university sector in a climate in which they had already reduced the amount of revenue flowing to universities from our international education market - substantially reduced revenue to universities over five years. They then decided this year that they would cut higher education further. One of those cuts was to introduce a cap of $2,000 on self-education expenses. It was a classic case of Labor taking a sledgehammer to smash a walnut.                 They claimed at the time that there were myriad examples of the education deduction being rorted by high-income earners. They have yet to produce any evidence that that has been the case. In fact, 80 per cent of the people who have claimed the self-education expenses deduction over many years have had incomes of less than $80,000 per annum. They were low- and middle-income earners. Greg Craven, the vice-chancellor of the Australian Catholic University described this move as 'the streaker's cap'. He said it sounded like 'a good idea at the time'. This government came to power and, on sober reflection, realised that the damage it would do to productivity and the higher education sector was not worth the savings the previous government had claimed, so the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, in their wisdom, decided that we would not proceed with the self-education expenses cap.                 That means that policemen, nurses, public servants and many low- and middle-income earners in Australia will be able to improve their skills. It is a productivity measure for us to not proceed with this cap. It will help the economy. What it confirms is that the coalition is the real friend of low- and middle-income earners in this place, which is why we on this side of the House represent so many of them. It also confirms that, while Labor talks tough and big about their representation of the workers, what they really represent is not the workers, who pay their dues to join a union and then do not get the representation they were told they would get, but the workers' bosses - the union leaders.

  I appreciate the question from the member from McMahon. I refer him to the latest published Economic Statement, which was published by - Oh! 'Chris Bowen' is on the front. On page 46 it says that the end-of-year amount this year will be $290 billion; next year, $330 billion; the year after, $350 billion; and the year after that, $370 billion. But Labor wants us to stop at $400 billion. Let me understand this. The Labor Party wants to reduce the debt that they only ever increased when they were in government. The Labor Party now says: 'Look, 400 billion is enough; let's draw a line at 400. You should be under 400 and you need to explain' - 'you' being us, the government - 'to the Australian people why 400' - a number based on Labor's own economic figures - 'is not enough.' Let me explain something.                     Labor says, 'Let's draw a line at $400 billion.' The first thing is that their own document, released only a few weeks ago, said $370 billion. But there is one person I never want to forget when it comes to debt and that is the member for Lilley. We laugh at the member for Lilley. He never let us down. In this place - and I remember this; I have a good memory for these things - in the last debt limit debate, he said, 'Listen, I've been advised by the Australian Office of Financial Management that you need to have a buffer.' He even underlined it. It is in colour. He underlined it and then he tabled it. The statement about the buffer says:                 _ where for policy reasons a debt cap is considered desirable, it would be prudent _ to set it at a level $40 billion to $60 billion higher than the peak _                  So I will just explain to the member for McMahon - I know he is not very good with numbers - that $370 billion of Labor debt plus $60 billion does not equal $400 billion. It actually equals far more than $400 billion, and I have not even got to the fact, yet, that every step of the way we are going to reduce Labor's debt. We want to reduce it by getting rid of the mining tax. That is $13 billion of Labor debt that is going. Then we want to get rid of the CEFC. That is another $8 billion of Labor debt we want to get rid of, and they are trying to stop us. The bottom line is that the tenants trashed the joint. Now we are trying to fix it and the biggest impediment is the Labor Party. They are addicted to debt and deficit.

  I thank very much the member for Wannon. He was a champion of Peter's Project over the course of the last three years. That was a local regional cancer service designed to provide support for people who otherwise would have had to travel to Melbourne. He was a champion of that service. We announced the funding, and that project will be delivered by this government.                 The other person to pay tribute to is the Treasurer, for his excellent summation of the way in which the Labor Party trashed the Australian economy and made it hard for Australian families. But the problem is that Labor's trashing did not stop there. Labor's trashing moved into the health portfolio every day that they were in government. The most vulnerable of Australians are those who are delivered services - in particular, chemotherapy services - in hospitals around the country. It was the Labor Party in government that said to the 150,000 people a year being delivered 832,000 infusions each year, 'We will not provide you with certainty of those services.' The Labor government changed the rules and created uncertainty for those most vulnerable.                      You are very sensitive, Tanya.                      Nasty, Tanya. It did not take long to come out! So what did the previous government do?                      I am happy to withdraw. I will aggravate her no further. The point is that there was a problem created by the previous government. It created uncertainty for those who are most vulnerable. That government created a problem because they ripped money out of chemotherapy services. And when they were made aware of the problem they did not fix it.                      Confronted with this problem, the former government did not fix it. What they said was, 'We'll provide six months of funding to chemotherapy patients.' That took it up to Christmas last year. They sat on it for six months. They provided great uncertainty for those patients - and not just those patients but their families as well. The most shameful thing was that there was not one dollar of provision made to provide those services from 1 January on. We put pressure on the government of the day. It was a problem of the government's own creation, but instead of fixing it they continued the uncertainty. I promise the Australian people and those patients this: this government will listen to their problems. This government will fix this problem. This government will deal with the difficulty that the Labor Party created. We will provide certainty to chemotherapy patients across the country and their families. Labor created a mess - not just of the economy but of health as well.

  I thank the member for Solomon for her question. I acknowledge that she, like so many members on our side, actually understands that a strong Defence Force is built on the shoulders of the strong men and women who serve. With personnel outlays being 40 per cent of the defence budget, the previous Labor government cuts have had an egregious impact on the personnel in the member's electorate.                  It is not just us saying this. Last night the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Dennis Richardson, said, when talking about Labor's severe cuts to the defence budget, that they had led not only to a moving of the goalposts but to their cutting down and being used as firewood. The secretary's comments, of course, show what we on this side have known for a long time and what this mob have denied for about five years: that the cumulative cuts of $25 billion that Labor hatcheted out of the Defence budget have had a disproportionate impact on the personnel, not only in the member's electorate but in electorates right across the country.                 It was this mob that reduced Defence expenditure as a proportion of GDP to the lowest levels since 1938. The 1938 levels are what they have left our country's Defence budget at, and the impact is considerable. Keep in mind that it was that Labor government that callously tried to cut the entitlement for return travel for members to go home for Christmas. We blocked that, we stopped that, and 1,500 single members of the member for Solomon's electorate will get to go home this Christmas because of the changes we wrought against what that government did.                 Keep in mind it was that Labor government that promised, for six years, to have free ADF health care and only delivered a trial. I say to the member for Solomon: in 48 days we will actually start free ADF health care. In 48 days 3,200 spouses and dependent children from the member for Solomon's electorate will have all out-of-pocket costs for GPs and up to $400 per individual for allied costs covered. In 48 days we will implement that.                 It was that Labor government over there that decided to cut the ADF gap year. It was a gap year that included 40 per cent of women coming through. We will put it back. We will restore the budget integrity for Defence. We will get it back to two per cent of GDP in the next 10 years. We will ensure there are no cuts. There is one side of this House that understands Defence men and women. It is this side and it is this government.

  Correct me if I am wrong, Madam Speaker; did he say it was not requested by the Reserve Bank?                     Well, they are wrong. The fact of the matter is -                      Be calm, okay? I know you are excited on the first day. This is your best day in opposition, trust me. In February of this year, when there was quite obviously a dispute between the member for Lilley and the Governor of the Reserve Bank, I raised concern about the level of funding in the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund. That is the fund available for the Reserve Bank to offset the risk of certain investments that it may have. Of course, the risk may increase according to movement in the Australian dollar and movement in interest rates. Traditionally the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund has never been below 10 per cent of the assets at risk. In periods of volatility, following the GFC, you would not want it below 10 per cent. In fact, the Reserve Bank had been very up-front about it. In 2009-10 the Labor Party took a special dividend out of the Reserve Bank of $5.2 billion. Every year prior to that it had been around $1 billion to $1½ billion, but in 2009-10 they took out a dividend of over $5 billion.                     They took out $5 billion. The Reserve Bank Reserve Fund dropped to 2.1 per cent from 9.6 per cent, and when we came into office it was 3.8 per cent. I spoke to the Governor of the Reserve Bank and I said: 'Are you properly prepared for the challenges that may lie ahead?' His answer, which he gave publicly the other day - and I am sure he will appear before the House Standing Committee on Economics - caused us to put $8.8 billion into the Reserve Bank to make sure that the Reserve Bank was at its strongest to deal with any challenges that come before the Australian economy. Labor does not get that.                 I call on the member for Lilley to write to the government to ask that all correspondence between him and the Reserve Bank is released to the Australian people, and in return I will release the letter from the Governor of the Reserve Bank about the $8.8 billion. He is pretty quiet up there. You are on your L-plates and he knows what he is doing.

  I would like to thank the honourable member for Leichhardt for the question. Before I start, Madam Speaker, I would have to say that you are the best Speaker that I have ever experienced. In fact, you are without comparison.                     It is not only the member for Leichhardt who would have an interest in this; also the former member for Durack, Barry Haase, in the gallery, would have an immense interest in this, and so would the member for Kennedy, if he were here. This issue really personified what the former government, the Labor government, was about. It was a sad day indeed when we woke up and found out that the country was not actually being run by the Labor government; it was being run by Four Corners - when we found out that one of our closest trading relationships, one of our most important partnerships, had been basically taken through the mud by reason of the rash and irrational actions of a government that just could not come to grips with the hard decisions.                 Ladies and gentlemen, in the gallery, and Madam Speaker, it is very important that we understand that, from the moment the opportunity came to assist this industry, the coalition put their shoulder to the wheel - going to Richmond and actually meeting the people who were part of this fiasco that had been delivered to them not by drought but by the Labor government. We had to do what we could within our power to try and assist.                 Might I also note that, since we have been in for the short duration of this coalition government, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade and Investment and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have been to Indonesia, and in this quarter we will more than double the number of cattle going to Indonesia. We will stand by this industry. In fact, we hope it grows, we hope it increases, because we stand by the return to the farm gate that this industry represents. We will be a responsible government. We will be a government that is not guided by Four Cornersbut is guided by the capacity to act diligently. I note that in the future we will also, within my department, take a delegation to Indonesia so that we can build on this relationship, expand this trade and show that we can bring dignity back to the people of Northern Australia and back to this industry, which is a great industry for our nation.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The budget update will be released as part of the MYEFO in mid-December, which is roughly the time when members opposite released MYEFO in years past. It is very simple. We are dealing with a mountain of debt which members opposite left as their legacy. We are dealing with Labor's legacy of debt and deficit. We want to rule a line under this embarrassing period in our fiscal history and get on with the job of paying back Labor's debt and eliminating Labor's deficit. That is what the Australian public elected us to do. That is what we will do. I would humbly and respectfully ask the Leader of the Opposition to allow the people's mandate to be worked out in this parliament.

  Thank you, Madam Speaker, and congratulations on your election. Isn't it great that the member for Ryan is back - a fearsome advocate for small businesses in her electorate. I thank her for the question. She is indeed very right: small businesses have been absolutely crippled by the 21,000 new and amended regulations introduced by Labor in their period of government. This has been one of the many headwinds that those courageous men and women, who take risks, create opportunities for themselves, mortgage their house and lie awake at night about the opportunities that they can provide for themselves and their community, have had to face. In addition to our comprehensive plan to put the business back into small business, we are tackling this red-tape burden head on. It is not only in the portfolio that I am responsible for but led by our Prime Minister. This is a whole of government effort to see a billion dollars worth of red and green tape taken out of the economy - those excessive intrusions of regulation that serve no good public policy purpose, that overreach, gum up the opportunities and gum up our economy. That is what we are tackling. We have put in place a range of measures. Each portfolio minister has a task to reduce red tape in their areas of responsibility. We have also got the Prime Minister leading that work, ably supported by the member for Kooyong. He is evangelical about the task of reducing red tape and it is great that he is on this case.                 We have already started, though, in the area of business names registration. Remember that offensive way in which home based businesses had their privacy violated, against the assurances of this government. That has been corrected as well, removing another red-tape obstacle. We have also got the red tape that will be cut by the removal of the carbon tax. And wouldn't it be great if all those opposite actually went to axe the tax that they said they were going to axe during the election campaign?                 We have also made a commitment to get employers out of being the pay clerk for the Paid Parental Leave scheme. Some of my new colleagues in this place might not be aware of it, but we put that measure to the parliament twice under the previous government. They voted against it on 24 February 2011. They voted against it on 24 May, saying it could not be done. But in a thought bubble, to try and look as though Labor had some ideas for small business, guess what they proposed during the election campaign - to do the very thing we had sought to deliver to small businesses on two previous occasions in this parliament.                 We are also looking to challenge the Australian Accounting Standards Board. Why is it our small businesses need to report at higher standards, with higher costs, than are set by the International Financial Reporting Standards? Why is this necessary? These are practical examples where we are going to tackle that red-tape scourge that small businesses in the Ryan electorate talk about. We want to put the business back into small business. What we need is a renaissance of enterprise in this country so that we can grow jobs and opportunities for the future, not lose 412,000 jobs in small business, which happened under Labor. We need to stop that decline, turn it around and put the business back into small business. Our economy will be stronger, our communities will be more vibrant and I look forward to working with you on that task.

  They have got chutzpah - they really do - and I tell you why. Labor do not know what a surplus looks like. Labor have never delivered a surplus. Oh, hang on! They did. They delivered a surplus well before my colleague Wyatt Roy was born! That is a long time ago. So now, having promised on over 500 occasions to deliver a surplus, Labor are indignant and say from opposition that they can deliver a surplus. That is quite an achievement. They could not do it in government but now the Labor Party are going to do it in opposition.                 I was thinking to myself: who can you trust about delivering a surplus, given that the coalition has previously done the heavy lifting? When Labor were last in government - before the last time - they left us with $96 billion of debt; they left us with the legendary Beazley black hole. They have now left us with at least $370 billion of debt and the Bowen black hole. But it gets better. The fact of the matter is that, as we open every cupboard across the government, we find more spiders. We discover that the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund is down to just 3.8 per cent. When we have, possibly, significant headwinds next year, out of Europe and the United States, we will have to fix them. And, when we find that the ACCC has been running at a loss for four years and is going to run out of money by April next year because the Labor Party did not give it the funding to do a full year of work, you would say there is something wrong about that and that someone has got to fix it. And, as the Minister for Health and all the other ministers know, as we open up every cupboard we discover that Labor just fibbed about the state of the books. What a surprise! It goes to trust.                  And no-one summarises it better than Bruce Hawker. And I promise that this will be the only time that I quote Bruce Hawker. Remember him? The member for Griffith remembers him and a few others remember him. I was not spending a lot of time reading his book called The Rudd Rebellion, but I did. He said:                 Chris Bowen had gone on Lateline last night and run the 'Who do you trust?' line (on instructions from CHQ) -                  that is, campaign headquarters -                  and I realised how ridiculous it sounded. After the last three years, we would be lucky to be trusted to walk the dog around the block _

  What a good man the member for Hasluck is. Thank goodness he is back. Labor did everything they could to stop him, but he is an outstanding representative for the people of Hasluck and Western Australia. We are proud to have him as a member of our team.                 The Labor Party, just before the election, announced a $1.8 billion tax on the car industry. In fact, they were so concerned about it that the member for McMahon had to ring from Moscow to ensure that the member for Griffith had not gone weak in committing to a $1.8 billion slug on the car industry. That was instructive enough, but this goes into the category of Labor taxes designated 'what were you thinking?'                 The carbon tax is in that mix, and all six versions of the mining tax are in that mix. Every tax that Labor came up with was pretty much in that mix. But the fringe benefits tax changes to motor vehicles is in the category designated 'what were you thinking?' That tax alone was like a baseball bat to the back of the car industry in Australia at a time when it was vulnerable. It actually turned out that the people who were most significantly affected by the changes to the fringe benefits taxes on motor vehicles were people earning less than $70,000 a year. What has the Labor Party got against hardworking but low- and middle-income Australians? It always does that, whether it is in relation to self-education expenses or fringe benefits tax changes on motor vehicles. It actually hit the people who were driving Australian cars, such as Toyotas, Commodores, Fords and a range of other vehicles, and it was hitting those people earning less than $80,000 a year the hardest.                 The member for Grayndler went out and said they were driving Maseratis. Well maybe in the inner west of Sydney they are driving Maseratis and earning $80,000 a year - and I had better call the tax man about that - but the fact is that it hurt the lowest income Australians. It hurt the charities. As the Prime Minister knows, when we met with the charities they were the ones who were being slugged the hardest. The Salvation Army, for example, confirmed it would have to raise an additional $4 million a year to comply with the Labor Party's announced changes in relation to fringe benefits tax for vehicles. Just think of those poor buggers out there, standing outside railway stations with cans, trying to raise money for the causes they know are important - and the Labor Party did not even think about that. The Salvos were going to be hit with an extra $4 million bill. That is the problem with this mob. They do not understand the implications of their decisions. It comes back to the fact that when it comes to tax, when it comes to the budget and when it comes to the economy you cannot trust Labor.

  I am not imagining the debt disaster that Australia has been saddled with by the former Labor government. The debt disaster is real, and this government is taking action to deal with Labor's legacy of debt and deficit.                     Getting to the question: I said in this parliament that we have never voted, under my leadership, against an increase in the debt cap - and that is absolutely correct.                 Leave not granted.

  I thank the member for McPherson for her question and I thank her for her concern to do the right thing by the people of Queensland and the people of Australia. There is no doubt the carbon tax was, is and always will be an act of economic self-harm. If you look at the former government's own figures, by 2050 Australia's cumulative gross domestic product would have been $1 trillion less with the carbon tax than it would have been without the carbon tax. We would have been $1 trillion poorer with the carbon tax than without the carbon tax under the former government's own figures. It is as if our economy were to close down for a whole year as a result of the impact of the carbon tax.                 But that is not all. Under the former government's own figures, by 2050 national income per person would have been almost $5,000 less with the carbon tax than without the carbon tax. Real wages would have been six per cent less with the carbon tax than without the carbon tax. These are the dire consequences, for ordinary working Australians, of the carbon tax that members opposite still support - only they never had the guts to be honest about it with the Australian people before the election.                     Under the former government's own figures: by mid-century, output in the aluminium industry would be 61 per cent less with the carbon tax than without it and output in the iron and steel industry would be 20 per cent less with the carbon tax than without it. And something that should haunt every member opposite: on the Labor Party's own figures, households are $550 a year worse off with the carbon tax than without it. That is why this government is utterly determined to get rid of this toxic tax.                 When it comes to the great state of Queensland, under the former government's own figures gross state product in Queensland would be four per cent lower by 2050 with the carbon tax than it would be without it. The carbon tax is an anti-Queensland tax, just as the mining tax is an anti-Western Australian tax. We support the great state of Queensland. That is why we are determined to scrap the carbon tax.

  Everyone knows which party in this House is the party of debt and deficit, and it is members opposite. We all know that members opposite were completely incapable of managing debt and deficit when they were in government. Now they think they can manage debt and deficit from opposition. What frauds they are. We will deal with Labor's debt and deficit problem. We will deal with it. Members opposite were like bad tenants who trashed the house before they were evicted. We are here to repair the place that they have so badly damaged. Members opposite should stop interfering with the fiscal repair job that this country so desperately needs.

  My thanks to the member for Dawson for his question. I acknowledge his passionate advocacy for the people of North Queensland. The reality is that the carbon tax is hurting all Australians, but particularly those who live in regional communities, who pay more for everything as a result of this carbon tax. It is a tax that has been costing jobs. It has made our industry less competitive and, therefore, made our country less able to achieve its potential. It adds insidiously to the cost of everything that we do.                 Even a visit to the dump costs more. As the member referred to, the Mackay Regional Council is paying about $1 million a year in carbon tax just on its Hogan's Pocket Landfill site - $1 million a year. That is no small amount, particularly for a regional city to pay. Sadly, there are 34 other communities across Australia that are also paying massive amounts of carbon tax on their landfill sites. If it generates more than 25,000 tonnes, they have to pay the carbon tax. Ironically, if it generates only 24,999 tonnes, they pay nothing, but for one extra tonne you are immediately up for a half a million dollars, and the amounts keep just going up and up.                 Of course, there is only one thing councils can do in response to this million-dollar tax and that is to pass it on to their ratepayers. The Mayor of Mackay was right when she said that the council was merely collecting on behalf of the federal government due to the tax. She was collecting a tax for the federal government and so she had no option but to raise the rates for residents of Mackay and district.                 This government has a mandate to get rid of that tax, to save the ratepayers this tax and to make sure that the cost of living falls right across the nation. But, unfortunately, Labor fail to recognise that mandate. They want the rates to remain high. They will not give the councils the opportunity to pass on these benefits to the ratepayers. Labor should listen, junk the garbage tax and consign the carbon tax itself to the dump. Let us get on with delivering the mandate we have from the Australian people.                     Confidential.

  During the election campaign and in the lead-up to the election campaign, the Labor Party made almost 1,000 promises to fund projects across Australia. Of 1,157 projects that Labor announced under its regional development program, 1,012 were not contracted - they were empty election promises.                     Nine hundred and ten of the projects that were announced and uncontracted were to councils, the local councils under this program, the regional development program. Round 5 was all to councils.                     That 910 included the project for the Mackay Regional Council that the honourable member refers to. So Labor had announced these projects, but none of them were contracted. None of them had even been reviewed by the department and assessed for their merit.                 The reality is we have our own election commitments and we will honour our election commitments. But I have never known a government to be expected to honour the election commitments made by the opposition side. They were not elected. Haven't they figured it out yet? They were not elected. The voters voted for our commitments and we will honour the commitments we have made.

  Thank you to the member for Bowman for his question. I am pleased to advise the House that after an absence of more than five years this government has restored temporary protection visas. Temporary protection visas were abolished by those on that side of the House - along with the Greens - when they came to government over five years ago. What followed in the wake of that everyone in this place will remember: over 50,000 people turned up on over 800 illegal boats to Australia. There was a budget blow-out of over $11 billion, and over 1,100 people perished at sea. That is what followed from the decision of the previous government to abolish temporary protection visas and the many other measures that had been introduced by the Howard government that had stopped the boats. The previous government had found a solution. They turned it into a problem of catastrophic levels, and they should hang their heads in shame.                 What they are doing in the Senate right now is joining up with the Greens, yet again, to defer the consideration of the Greens motion, which is to disallow the introduction of temporary protection visas. They are teaming up with the Greens to defer the decision for some weeks yet. This portrays the problem that those on the Labor side have always had on this issue. They are double minded, they are divided on this issue, and they always defer to the Greens. That is what they are doing here.                 So I am pleased to say that temporary protection visas are back, and they are back because those on that side of the House left behind a legacy caseload of 33,000 people that they had not processed. This government has a big job to stop the boats and we are making a good start, with a reduction of 75 per cent in illegal arrivals by boat since Operation Sovereign Borders commenced. But we have another big task, and that task is to clear the backlog of Labor's lethargy when it comes to how they dealt with people who they allowed to come into this country. Had they been re-elected, those people would all be getting permanent visas - but not under this government, because this government believes what it says. We have conviction on this issue. Those on that side were double minded. They flipped and they flopped and they went with every wind that passed through that debate. As a result, they could not be believed. But, now, under this government, every measure is backed by resolve, because the people-smugglers know that this government means business. That government, when it was in power, could not hold a position from one day to the next.

  Last night I issued a statement about that matter. I made it very clear in that statement that the place of rescue, where the passengers were rescued, was closer to Indonesia than it was to Australia. We therefore sought to take those rescued passengers, in accordance with international search and rescue protocols, to the nearest place of safety, which was Indonesia, not Australia. That is the practice we have been following and that is the practice that has proved effective on many occasions.                 But these are matters which we continue to work through with the Indonesian government, who are a strong partner. I want to stress how strong a partner they are. The cooperation that we receive from Indonesia and the strong leadership they show, particularly on on-land disruptions in Indonesia, has been extraordinary, because it has been that leadership from Indonesia, working together through our government and through the Bali process, that has meant that we now know that more people are being stopped from coming to Australia under sovereign borders than are arriving. That is why we are having success.                     I know those on the other side are sensitive on this issue, and they should be. They should be very sensitive on this issue, because under that side of the House they ran a taxi service. They ran a water taxi service and they were open for business for that water taxi service. Under that side of the House we measured illegal arrivals by boat in the thousands per month. Under this government, they are measured in the hundreds.                 Where these people will be processed is on Nauru and Manus Island, because they are being processed offshore. That was one of the many policies that were put in place by the previous Howard government that were abolished by those on that side of the House along with temporary protection visas. They had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to restore offshore processing, and they restored it under protest. When they restored it, it was underfunded, it was incompetently put together, it did not send the signal and it did not provide the effective implementation that makes the policy work. Any and every measure to deter boat arrivals, regardless of who the author is, will always be more effective in the hands of a coalition government that believes in a border protection policy and a border protection initiative than in the hands of Labor, who are double minded, divided and always deferring to the Greens.

  I thank the member for Denison for his question, and I respect the passion and the commitment that the member for Denison brings to the particular issue about which he has asked me. If I may say so, though, respectfully to the member, the government does support the live animal export trade and we want to encourage the trade rather than discourage the trade. Yes, it does have to take place under the right conditions. But it is an important trade. The live animal export trade is worth up to $1 billion a year, and I would like to think that in the years to come it might be worth more. The live animal export trade employs about 10,000 people, and I would like to think that in the years to come it might employ more, particularly in northern Australia, where it is quite an important industry.                 I know there are many in this House who would prefer to see exports of, for instance, boxed beef rather than of live animals, but in many countries such as Indonesia, where reliable power is not always available in some of the more remote places, the only way to get beef to those people, to improve their diets, is through live cattle going to wet markets. So this trade is important for Australia. It is important for countries such as Indonesia, and it should be encouraged, although I accept the member's point that it should be encouraged under the right conditions.                 To get to the specifics of your question: the government will always investigate breaches. I believe we are investigating a number of breaches at the moment, and if those investigations turn out to reveal breaches we will take the relevant action. But, in what may disappoint the member, I have to say that we are satisfied with the rules as they stand and we do not intend to toughen them further.

  Thank you very much. That is a great question, because it focuses on the fact that it is the coalition that is getting rid of the mining tax and getting rid of the carbon tax. We want to reduce the burden on business so that business can get on with investing and creating jobs. But the Labor Party is opposing all this, of course. The Labor Party is opposing our attempt to get rid of the carbon tax, to reduce the electricity bills for people in the member for Forrest's electorate - every electorate in Australia, in fact. And the Labor Party is opposing our abolition of the mining tax. The mining tax is a signature example of failed policy. When it was originally announced - and I want to pay credit to the member for Lilley for the policy, because he was the architect of the original policy - the member for Lilley described it as a historic reform. He wasn't wrong, was he! It was a historic reform.                      Well, he didn't bother staying around for the member for Griffith last night, which was quite rude, so he wouldn't listen to me if he doesn't listen to the member for Griffith!                 I just make the point that the RSPT, when it was announced originally, was meant to raise $49.5 billion. When the second version of the mining tax was announced, they reduced it and they said it was going to raise $26.5 billion. The tax has been such a success to date that it has raised $400 million, and it has cost the Australian Taxation Office $50 million to collect $400 million! But the problem for the Labor Party is this: they locked in all this expenditure against a tax that does not raise any money. Therefore, if we get rid of the tax and all of the expenditure, it improves the budget bottom line by over $13 billion.                 The Labor Party are so appalled, outraged, about the debt that they are opposing everything we are trying to do to get it down. It is like poisoning the well and then, afterwards, when they go into opposition, they start to drink from the well and they do not understand why it does not taste like Coca-Cola. It actually has poison in it. The Labor Party do not understand that they poisoned the economy and they poisoned the budget. Like bad tenants, they trashed the joint, and now they are doing everything they can to stop us from fixing it. But the bottom line is: this is Labor's debt, this is Labor's mismanagement, this is Labor's mining tax and we are going to get rid of it.

  As I reminded the House yesterday, the coalition announced a policy before the last election that we would be implementing Operation Sovereign Borders. This is a very different way of doing things - a very, very different way. And I have to say, one of the key differences is that we now measure arrivals in the hundreds, not the thousands - as we did under the previous government. But there are many differences that are taking place, and one of those differences is the way that we handle information. We do it on the guidance of the Joint Agency Task Force of Operation Sovereign Borders, and it is done for this purpose: so as to not use information to advantage people smugglers to sell their product.                 Those opposite might not understand this, because under their government they were not running such an operation; they were running a water taxi service. They were happy to let people smugglers know where their vessels were and how successful their operations were and to provide them proofs of voyage that could be used to provide proof of payment and to accept payment and get the cashflow of the business running. They were very happy to do that. But we are not running that sort of an operation. That is why the communications protocols about what happens within Operation Sovereign Borders, which are tactical on-water operations and things of that nature, are not things that are canvassed publicly. To do so would be to assist people smugglers to get people on boats that sink. If that is what the opposition is encouraging the government to do - to go back on our election promises -                      To provide the information that the opposition has requested would be to violate the communications protocols which have been established by the Joint Agency Task Force for Operation Sovereign Borders. To do so, as I said, would aid people smugglers. I know that those opposite got everything they wanted when they were last in government, together with the cheers of the Greens. They were able to abolish all the measures that worked, and they invited the 50,000 arrivals, which they duly advised to the people-smuggling audience all around the world and encouraged them to keep coming. This government is not going to engage in the practices of the former government, and that is why we are seeing a 75 per cent reduction in arrivals. What remains available to the government is to implement the full suite of measures that we took to the Australian people and, most importantly, the resolve to back it up, which the previous government dismally lacked.

  I thank my friend the member for Casey for his question. In 2001 the Cole royal commission, a commission founded by the now Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, found that construction sites were hotbeds of intimidation, thuggery, lawlessness and violence. In 2005 the Howard government established the Australian Building and Construction Commission. This comes as no surprise to the members of the Labor Party, of course. In 2012 the Leader of the Opposition abolished the Australian Building and Construction Commission. While the Australian Building and Construction Commission existed, construction industry productivity grew by nine per cent, consumers were better off by $7.5 billion annually and there were fewer working days lost through industrial action. But presumably the Leader of the Opposition did not support those positive economic outcomes, because he moved to abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission.                 The Grocon dispute in Melbourne last year plumbed new depths for Labor thuggery - I mean union thuggery; a Freudian slip! - intimidation of workers. The workers at Grocon themselves published this advertisement, which my friend the member for Casey referred to, which, amongst other things, said:                 Grocon employees are fed up and disappointed with the Union representing their own needs and agendas against, over and beyond Grocon employees wishes.                 _ All we want is to be able to go to work and be allowed to provide for our families and loved ones.                 _ We only ask that we be allowed the same basic rights our Union leadership enjoy, to be free to access our places of work without the lies, threats and abuse, and without fear of reprisals.'                 Today we move to reintroduce the Australian Building and Construction Commission, because this side of the House represents workers in Australia, and the other side of the House represents union leaders. The Leader of the Opposition will oppose this move, because when the union leaders come to see the Leader of the Opposition about policy it is like pushing against an open door. The problem with the Leader of the Opposition is he does not believe in anything at all. The only thing he believes in is gaining power, so the union leaders support him; he will support their wishes. It is hard to disagree with someone when you do not believe in anything. And the problem with the Leader of the Opposition, because he believes in nothing at all, is that when the union leaders say 'Jump', he asks, 'How high?'                 I table the Grocon advertisement from the employees and the Independent Economics analysis of the economic benefits of the Australian Building and Construction Commission from 2013.

  I can understand why those opposite are unfamiliar with the way these sorts of issues are handled, because they have never engaged in them. When the opposition was in government they just picked people up and invited more to come, which was not just by their operations but by the way they conducted themselves in this place and other places as they constantly defaulted to softer and softer policies. Only as time wore on and the political winds blew hard against them were they dragged kicking and screaming to restore some of the measures of the previous government. But, when you do not believe in those measures, it is not surprising that you do not do them with any conviction or with any success.                     Thank you, Madam Speaker. Commenting on on-water operational matters at sea would be to telegraph tactics employed by the government as to how these measures were handled. That is why the Joint Agency Task Force, which runs our military led border security operation, has so far led to a 75 per cent reduction in illegal arrivals of boats and people to Australia.                     Thank you, Madam Speaker. It is for those reasons that the government does not comment on on-water operational matters. It is to protect the measures that we know do stop the boats and have stopped the boats, and under this government the boats are stopping again.

  I thank the honourable member for her question and congratulate her on her election and on her first speech yesterday. As the honourable member will know, the people of Western Sydney have been receiving Labor promises, unfulfilled, of better infrastructure for years. There are at least half a dozen rail projects from the state government, and from the Labor federal government they were told before the election that there were 85,000 homes in Western Sydney where construction had commenced. But, in fact, building contracts had only been signed for half of them. Another fact that was denied the people of Western Sydney at the election was that there were, in fact, only 303 homes in brownfield areas actually connected to the NBN. Only 303 connected in all of Western Sydney, a region of 1.9 million people, and that is after six years in government and more than $5 billion in taxpayers' funding.                 Of course, the honourable members knows, and we all know, that there are many areas in Australia that have absolutely inadequate broadband, often no broadband at all. That is why my department is conducting a comprehensive survey to ascertain for the first time where the broadband needs are greatest. I was in the honourable member for Chifley's electorate last week in Derwent Parade in Blacktown to see some broadband being rolled out by the NBN - fibre to the premises. Was that an area of inadequate broadband? No, Madam Speaker, it was not. The people of Derwent Parade could buy not one but two competing 100-megabit-per-second broadband services from each of Telstra and Optus. So, while there were homes in Western Sydney that had no broadband, the NBN was being rolled out in the honourable member for Chifley's electorate in streets where they had some of the best broadband in Australia.                 The honourable member asked me about accountability. Unlike the Labor Party, whose statistics were not in English when talking about the NBN but were in Conrovian, a bizarre Orwellian language that was impossible to understand and was calculated to mislead, we are publishing every week the up-to-date rollout figures in plain English. But it gets worse for the Labor Party. The honourable member for Blaxland, the shadow minister, and I agreed that there would be a joint committee on the NBN as there was in the last parliament. We agreed that that should be the committee that dealt with it. But Senator Lundy, the disappointed Senator Lundy, rolled him and there is now a Senate committee looking into the NBN, on which neither of the Leader of the Opposition's broadband spokesmen are able to sit. What a failure of leadership on behalf of -

  Again, it is an operational matter. But I can tell you this, and that is that the measures which comprise $20 million to effectively engage communities across Indonesia, where we have had great success in getting their cooperation to spread the message about the evils of people-smuggling - which those measures and many others that were contained in that package were designed to achieve - are progressing well.

  I thank my friend the member for Mitchell for his question. Today the government moved to introduce the Registered Organisations Commission. We did so for two primary reasons. The first of course is to protect the reputation of union leaders that do the right thing. There are many union leaders out there whose reputations have been seriously damaged by the illegal actions of a few, and we moved today to restore the reputations of those union leaders who do the right thing. But, secondly, we want to make sure that we can reassure union members that this side of the House recognises their desire that their union membership dues are used with integrity. This side of the House once again is demonstrating that we genuinely represent workers' interests.                 Members of unions who pay their fees, especially low-paid workers at the Health Services Union, should be able to know that their hard earned dollars are being spent with integrity. We are not the only people who think this. Paul Howes, the head of the Australian Workers Union, said on 26 November 2012:                 I actually believe there is a higher responsibility for us as guardians of workers' money to protect that money and to act diligently and honestly.                 The reality is I do not have any issue with increasing the level of requirements and penalties on trade unions for breaching basic ethics like misappropriation of funds.                 If only the Leader of the Opposition shared Mr Howes's view about registered organisations. The Leader of the Opposition has forgotten the 181 contraventions of the registered organisations act and HSU rules found by Fair Work Australia. He has obviously forgotten that the member for Dobell, the former member, has been charged with 150 criminal related fraud charges against misappropriation of HSU funds. He has forgotten that the former ALP president, Mike Williamson, has pleaded guilty to misusing almost $1 million of HSU members' funds.                 While this government is standing up for the unions, the Leader of the Opposition is once again following the lead of his union minders. But do not take my word for it. Bruce Hawker, writing in the The Rudd rebellion, said:                 _ any firm position on party reform which reduces union influence could easily see Shorten retreat from any support he is now showing for a Rudd revival.                 We know that at the end of the day the Leader of the Opposition is simply a union stooge for his union minders.

  I have no information within my folder here which goes to the matters that would deal with the briefing I would give tomorrow. But I will tell you this: once again, the communications protocols established for Operation Sovereign Borders provide for a once-weekly report to be provided by the commander of the JDF at that briefing which updates details of arrivals and transfers to offshore processing centres. That is the practice we will follow because that is the practice that ensures the integrity of the operation that we are running that has led to a 75 per cent reduction in illegal arrivals by boat to Australia since Operation Sovereign Borders was put in place. I know those opposite do not want to hear that figure. I know they do not want to hear the figure that arrivals by boat illegally under Operation Sovereign Borders have fallen by 75 per cent. That is a figure that they should reflect on because when they were in government we measured them in the thousands.                 I am not going to violate a protocol that has been put in place by the JDF to ensure the integrity of that operation for the entertainment of those members opposite or others. We will ensure the integrity of that operation just as we will ensure the integrity of our borders, because that is what the Australian people elected us to do. We are doing what we said we would do and we will get on and do it.

  I thank the member for Macquarie for her question and also thank her for a visit to her electorate in July this year where we went to the Bunya Child Care Centre and witnessed an Indigenous Welcome to Country and dance, which was very special. One of the critical issues that was raised by the member for Macquarie's childcare centres and services was the amount of red tape under which all services are operating. As shadow minister visiting hundreds of centres across the country, it was a theme that I heard many, many times.                 The coalition government wants a thriving childcare and early-learning sector that delivers flexible, accessible and affordable quality education and care. But, as we know, Labor's agenda is to tax, spend and interfere. And nowhere is that interference written larger than in the amount of red tape and regulation that childcare services face.                  The point I want to make is that much of this does not relate to the critical relationship inside the childcare centre, which is between the educator and the child. We have absolute commitment to quality, education and care, but we recognise that the volume of red tape under which services have been operating is just too much. It is pushing up the cost of child care and parents are rapidly finding that child care is becoming unaffordable which, in turn, influences their participation in the workforce and influences the productivity of the nation as a whole.                  So I look forward to reassuring the member for Macquarie's constituents and taking the real-world examples that she, as well as members from other electorates, may bring to this place about how we can actively pursue an agenda that reduces costs around red tape.                 I also want to mention that we are, as promised prior to the election, announcing the first public examination of Australia's childcare and early-learning system in almost 20 years, with a Productivity Commission inquiry which will look at the policy settings from a generation ago and reflect new ones for the future.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. On day 1 of the new government we saved the car industry from Labor's $1.8 billion fringe benefits tax hit. That is what we did. Today in this parliament we are seeking to save the car industry from the carbon tax, which has added up to $400 to the cost of a domestically produced new car. Apart from that, we will implement the policies that we took to the election, and the policies that we took to the election are designed to ensure that, amongst other things, the car industry has the best possible chance of surviving into the future.

  I thank the member for Cowan for his question. I regret to inform the House that under the former government power prices just about doubled. They literally doubled over the life of the former government. The carbon tax was not the only factor in the doubling of prices but it certainly made a bad situation very much worse. The whole point of the carbon tax was to put up the price of power because power is responsible for the bulk of Australians' emissions. The whole point of abolishing the carbon tax is to reduce Australians' power bills. That is the whole point of abolishing the carbon tax, to reduce Australians' power bills by on average $200 a year per household. This is a very important benefit that we wish to give to the households of Australia. Abolishing the carbon tax will reduce power bills by $200 a year as part of the $550 a year cost savings that it will give to the households of Australia. Let us be absolutely crystal clear: remove the carbon tax and power prices will fall. As the chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said just the other day, what went up will clearly come down when you take away the carbon tax. He said: 'Prices went up by nine per cent. When you take it away, you reverse that. It's really quite straightforward.' That is what Rod Sims said. Members opposite introduced the carbon tax without a mandate. Now they are actively obstructing the mandate that the new government most clearly has. Members opposite should learn to take the electorate seriously.

  I would like to thank Mr Pitt, who has won the seat of Hinkler after the very distinguished career of Mr Paul Neville. The problem we have is that over the other side of the chamber we have a very interesting group of people. Over the other side of the chamber we have government-change deniers - a government-change denier there and a government-change denier there. Some of them are not denying there is a change of government, some of them have got queries about a change of government, but generally they are government-change deniers. On a more sombre note, what we have in Queensland is the fact that we have thousands of people whose jobs are at risk because they are denying the change of government.                     They are denying the mandate of the people. We have people in Queensland who are going to lose millions of dollars in the sugar industry because they deny the change of government                  By reason of their denying the change of government, we have a situation where less money is getting back through the farm gate to the people of Hinkler, to the people of Dawson, to the people in the sugar industry. It is not just the sugar industry which is suffering this; it is also the cattle industry, it is the sheep industry and it is the grain industry. Remember, after these government-change deniers, the carbon tax, which was the essence of their government, will come into transport. Therefore, on everything we do, there will be a little legacy of these government-change deniers, unless they decide to accept the truth that the government has changed.

  It is interesting to receive a question from the opposition minister who presided over a 44 per cent increase in the cost of child care during her time in government and simply sat on her hands and, at one stage, said that it was only going up by 57c a week. The opposition minister has asked me about family day care and long day care prior to the Productivity Commission review. We are launching - the Prime Minister and I actually launched the draft terms of reference about a year ago - an inquiry into child care in order to make it more affordable, flexible and accessible for families. The one message I have always heard and we have always heard on this side concerns the lack of affordability and flexibility.                  The opposition minister is talking about changes to family day care and changes to other forms of care, but everything that comes under the purview of child care will be considered by the Productivity Commission -                      opposition minister - everything. We are having a wide-ranging inquiry. Nothing is on or off the table, and nor should it be.                      I have no plans to make any changes prior to the Productivity Commission review. The Productivity Commission reports in October 2014. So what the shadow minister is asking me is what I am going to do before a review even starts, before it is even completed, before it even comes to the parliament, before we even consider any legislative changes. The question does not make any sense.

  I do thank the member for his question. I am aware of media reports alleging Australian intelligence gathering. I wish to make a number of points in response. First of all, all governments gather information and all governments know that every other government gathers information. I should add for the member's benefit that the Australian government never comments on specific intelligence matters. This has been the long tradition of governments of both political persuasions and I do not intend to change that today. I should also say that the Australian government uses all the resources at its disposal, including information, to help our friends and our allies, not to harm them.                  My first duty is to protect Australia and to advance our national interests, and I will never, ever depart from that. Consistent with that duty, I will never say or do anything that might damage the strong relationship and the close cooperation that we have with Indonesia, which is, all in all, our most important relationship - a relationship that I am determined to foster, a relationship that I am determined will grow stronger in the months and years ahead.

  I thank the member for Swan for his question. More than 4,000 of his constituents work in the mining industry, and that is hugely important to his electorate. A vast number of others would be working in associated industries for the mining industry. Mining is hugely important for Australia. It represents more than 10 per cent of our economy and more than 55 per cent of all merchandise exports from Australia.                  When the Labor Party introduced the mining tax all those years ago - the original mining tax, because there were five versions in fewer than five years - it was meant to raise nearly $50 billion. So far, we think it might have raised $400 million. But I am being generous; the numbers have not come in. So far, it has been an absolute disaster on every front. The problem was that Labor spent all the money they had never collected. They spent all that money, handing it out here, handing it out there. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition was one of the great heroes of the mining tax, which he described as:                 This is big economic reform which will share the benefits of the mining boom with all Australians on all incomes.                 That is a bit like the fishes and the loaves. Here is this $400 million tax. It is going to go to everyone. Everyone is going to win out of it. But to be fair - I do not want to be unfair to the Leader of the Opposition - it was the member for Lilley who came up with the mining tax. He was right when he said:                 If we don't have revenue from the tax, then we can't make the investments.                 That was Wayne Swan, ABC Radio, Perth, 2011. Absolutely right. If there is no money from the tax, then you cannot keep spending against it. But Labor did. Labor committed $16.7 billion of expenditure against the tax that hardly raises any money - hardly raises any money. That is irresponsible, and it is irresponsible for the Labor Party to oppose us now. I want to quote the member for Lilley again, because he is very quotable. He said in this place - and you have to get a load of the beginning of it - in 2008:                 We have built a $22 billion surplus to fight inflation, put downward pressure on interest rates. The opposition through their irresponsible actions up in the Senate are trying to punch a huge hole in that surplus.                 I say to the member for Lilley: speak to the front bench here and explain to them that if they really do care about the budget and if they really do care about reducing the huge legacy of debt that they have left the Australian people, then they will immediately support the repeal of the flawed mining tax.

  It is an interesting point of view for the opposition minister to put: that as a result of a review families might be worse off. What a review does, let me remind the House, is to go out and in this case it is broad-ranging - it seeks everybody's opinion. In our case, we are actually asking parents what they want the system to do for them, not telling them. What that review does is bring information to government that then makes informed policy decisions and choices. How can a review possibly make a difference to payments? I noted the slightly hysterical words of the opposition minister during her doorstop yesterday, and I would like to reiterate that the Productivity Commission will consider how the childcare system can be made more flexible, more affordable and accessible. There is nobody better to look at it than the PC, and in fact it has been welcomed from all sides. Our friends from United Voice have put out a media release today saying how pleased they are that the Productivity Commission is doing this work, Shadow Minister. It is the first public examination of the childcare system for 20 years. When you consider, Madam Speaker, the appalling record of the opposition when in government - with 44 per cent hikes in child care, parents unable to afford to have their children looked after and educated while they went to work. We have, Shadow Minister, no plans to index the childcare rebate. We have no plans to index the childcare rebate.

  I thank the member for Macarthur for his question. As a member representing Western Sydney, he will be pleased to be able to be reporting back to his constituents that since Operation Sovereign Borders began, there has been a 75 per cent decline in illegal arrivals by boat to Australia. I know that will be of keen interest to the people who elected a Liberal-National government to achieve those sorts of results.                  Sri Lanka is a critical partner in our efforts to ensure that we put paid to the people-smuggling trade. They have been a consistent supporter, not only for this government, but of previous governments. The support that went back in return for the Sri Lankan government from previous governments has, frankly, not measured up to the opportunity that was there to realise the full potential. Working with the Prime Minister and others, I was pleased to recommend that two Bay class vessels that are a part of the border protection fleet - Customs vessels - should be gifted to the Sri Lankan government, and the Prime Minister was in Sri Lanka on the weekend to make that announcement. That announcement of gifting actual patrol boats to be actively engaged in patrols to stop people coming to Australia illegally by boat is the sort of cooperation and assistance that I know the Sri Lankan government was seeking.                  I was there in January with the now Minister for Foreign Affairs and the now Minister for Justice, who will recall also that long-range patrol assets were critical in their area of weakness that needed to be filled to ensure that they would have that capability. We are pleased to provide it. I am also pleased to report that the practice of screen-in, screen-out for Sri Lankan arrivals has achieved new levels of results under this government. Under the previous government, one in six were screened out this year - one in six. There has been one vessel with Sri Lankans on board that has turned up under this government. It had 79 passengers, and all 79 have been returned to Sri Lanka.                  I was also asked about what other measures are being taken in this area. We are also fulfilling our promise to ensure that the 33,000 people who turned up on the previous government's watch and who came for a permanent visa will not get one. Those opposite wanted to ensure - and still want to ensure, it would seem - that they get what the people smugglers sought to give them and that they paid for, because they are frustrating the Senate and deferring motions regarding our re-introduction of temporary protection visas. It is not bad enough that the opposition wants to run a campaign for the people smugglers' right to know, now they want us to fulfil the promise by ensuring that they got the permanent protection visas that that government wanted to give them previously, and this government never will.

  I refer to my previous answer that we have no plans to means test the childcare rebate. But I would like to take this opportunity, since the shadow minister has decided to ask me another question along the same lines as her previous two, to remind people of Labor's fabulous written-in-gold promise, in child care -                      Of 260 new centres, 38 were built - page 2 of a press release, buried behind a whole lot of guff. Too embarrassed to talk about the reality.                     I repeat my previous statement: the government has no plans to means test the childcare rebate.

  I thank the honourable member for Canning for his question about independent public schools. I can tell him that Mr Finlay, the principal of the Ocean Road Primary School, is right. He is correct. Independent public schools are transformational schools in Western Australia. They are making an enormous difference to student outcomes, to the communities in which they are being developed, and the Western Australian government should be congratulated for the excellent work they are doing in creating transformational, independent public schools.                 Mr Finlay is not alone; he is in very good company, when it comes to support for more school autonomy. The OECD, in their PISA report, said: 'PISA show a clear relationship between learning outcomes and the relative autonomy of schools.' The UK schools white paper, in 2010, said: 'Across the world, the case for the benefits of school autonomy has been established beyond doubt,' and the report of choice for the opposition, the Gonski report - even in the Gonski report, which the Labor Party likes to quote - says studies have shown that school leaders who are able to make decisions, including decisions about hiring staff and over the school budget, do well in terms of student achievement.                  Because of that, we are going to extend independent public schools across Australia, working with the states and territories in cooperation. We are going to put $70 million aside in a fund to encourage more independent public schools, because we think it does have a major transformational effect in student outcomes and in local communities. Many members of the Labor Party have supported this policy over the years. Former Prime Minister Julia Gillard said: 'Today in Western Australia, as a result of our resources and reforms, more than 30 state schools are now called independent public schools.' In fact, the former Prime Minister, Mr Rudd said: 'We go to the importance of greater autonomy for school principals so that there is much greater power to hire and fire and to use the resources available to the school with discretion by the principal as they see fit.'                  And the shadow Treasurer - who is hanging his head, of course, because he knows what is coming - in his book In Hearts &amp; Minds: A Blueprint for Modern Labor said: 'Western Australia with the support of a federal Labor government has taken more tentative steps towards more independence for public schools.' But his view is not shared by the Leader of the Opposition. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition said: 'Tony Abbott and Christopher Pyne want to follow Premier Colin Barnett's lead in Western Australia by privatising our public schools. It is eerily similar to Angelo Gavrielatos, head of the Teachers Federation, who said: 'We are part of a privatisation agenda.' Once more, the Leader of the Opposition is showing he is the cat's paw of the union movement - in this case, the Teachers Federation.

  I am very happy to be standing here to support the Assistant Minister for Education who has answered, very well, these questions. To speak in support of the Assistant Minister for Education, this government is determined to do whatever we reasonably can to improve our childcare system.                  The childcare system has not been comprehensively reviewed for more than 20 years. We think that the best way -                      We think that the best way to consider the childcare system is to give it to the Productivity Commission, which has done such good work when it comes to disabilities, when it comes to aged care and when it comes to paid parental leave. This is the right body to advise us as to how we can best look at our childcare system to try to ensure that it best reflects the 24/7 nature of the modern workplace and the diversity of the modern Australian family.                 So that is what we propose to do. I can indicate to the House that we will do a much better job when it comes to child care than the former government did, which promised to end the double drop-off and which promised 260 childcare centres, and broke that promise after just 38 of them had been delivered. But what we will not be doing is breaking our pre-election commitments, and we have no intention to means test.

  I thank the honourable member for her question, and I note her passion and strong advocacy for ensuring her community has access to very fast broadband. She is quite right: the biggest barrier to broadband is not technology, it is affordability. Australians on the lowest incomes have the lowest rate of internet usage in their households.                 Of course, under Labor's NBN plan - and this is their plan, not ours - average revenue per user was going to treble from 2012 to 2021. So they were going to spend tens of billions of dollars on broadband and make it less affordable for Australians, not more affordable.                 But of course the truth is that there was a lot about the NBN that the Labor government knew that it did not share with the Australian people. The former minister, the member for Grayndler, was well aware from the NBN Co. itself that it was not going to hit its targets for 30 June 2014. He refused to release the reports and indications that showed it was going to miss that target by 70 per cent. He then -                      The honourable member would be well aware that it was tabled, actually, in the Australian Financial Review, so it is hardly a secret!                 But yet, there is more - there is a great deal more. On the weekend we learnt that the Labor government had been advised by its investment banker, Lazard, that the NBN, on the government's plan, was going to result in a $31 billion loss - a negative net present value. And they did not share that with anyone. The NBN has been the characteristically reckless Labor undertaking from the very start - from the moment it was conceived by Senator Conroy and Kevin Rudd on the back of a beer coaster on a VIP flight.                 And that beer coaster should be elevated. It should be an exhibit in Labor's pool room of horrors, it really should.                     No! It should be there with other historic artefacts, such as the fridge at the Lodge on which Prime Minister Gough Whitlam approved the Khemlani loans arrangements, to bypass the loans council. And, of course, the Labor pool room of horrors should not be without the lazy Susan from the Hong Ho Vietnamese restaurant where the Leader of the Opposition plotted the downfall of Kevin Rudd!

  I am delighted to get that question from the shadow minister! Now we are on the topic of releasing things, I call on the Leader of the Opposition to release -                      Madam Speaker, I will be very directly relevant, but I am concerned that the shadow minister opposite, who recently compared this place to Hogwarts, now obviously believes he has magical powers of being able to foretell the future. The decisions about incoming minister's briefs are taken not by the minister but by the senior public servants that take them, but I would be prepared - very, very happy - to encourage my secretary to release that incoming minister's brief if the Leader of the Opposition were prepared to consent to release all of the cabinet papers relating to the NBN, because Senator Wong -                      That is very relevant.                     Transparency is the order of the day and I embrace that wholeheartedly. Senator Wong went on television on Sunday and, reacting to the report about this investment advice -                      It's got nothing to do with your interests, has it? You can't stand the truth, can you? But here it is -                      Senator Wong said the negative $31 billion figure was 'selective advice'. She did not deny that was given to the government, so we know that was given to the government. The way to put it into context -                      is for all those documents to be released -                      and you can do it.                     Madam Speaker, it gets worse and worse: he thinks he is in Hogwarts! He thinks I had a document under -

  I thank the member for Murray for her question and her abiding interest in this topic. Today is not only the birthday of my friend and colleague the Minister for Health and my friend and colleague the Minister for the Environment, it is actually the birthday of the Food and Grocery Prescribed Industry Code of Conduct. It is a very exciting day for those in the supply chain and I am getting a lot of encouragement about the significance of this day. We have seen for many years concerns about the imbalance in market power where these very large businesses, our major supermarket retailers, have been dealing with much smaller suppliers and small business and how at times the small businesses feel quite vulnerable and quite unable to exercise great commercial leverage because they are so dependent on those supermarkets.                 Our encouragement to Coles and Woolworths and the Food and Grocery Council, recognising that they know their industry best, is to do their best work in coming up with a collaborative code, in working cooperatively to address the legitimate concerns that are there. They started that work when the coalition was in opposition and, despite the clear and consistent message from the coalition, the previous Labor government was all over the place. In fact, that work was actually ruined by a politically motivated intervention by the previous government to try and position itself, Labor, as doing something about this area of concern but then actually destroying the very collaboration that was leading to the outcome that we have today. So today I was pleased to receive this document.                 This is a voluntary code. Just so people are aware of what a voluntary code is, that means people can volunteer to participate, but once they have chosen to participate it becomes a prescribed code and they are then bound to abide by the provisions of this code. So if Coles and Woolworths, as they have stated today, volunteer to engage - and we encourage all retailers to do that - then if they decide to withdraw everyone will know, everyone will see that action. For people who misunderstand the nature of these codes, I hope that gives them a very clear indication of what is going on.                 It mandates grocery supply agreements which - for the member for Murray - will deal with transparency and predictable terms. It will deal with what are fair and reasonable minimal terms. It will put a limit on the kinds of changes that can be made mid-contract. It will talk about what happens with shrinkage and wastage, where some suppliers in the past have been expected to fund shrinkage and wastage in a retail business even though they have no control over that business. It deals with delisting. It deals with payment predictability. It deals with how product quality and standards will be dealt with. It will deal with how own brands are dealt with, so that an idea or an innovation that a supplier might raise with a supermarket is not picked up and run off to the own brand area and perhaps given to another supplier. It has dispute resolution mechanisms. This is a very significant and substantial step forward in an area of market concern. Where Labor failed to act, the coalition has acted. I recognise and welcome Coles, Woolworths and the Australian Food and Grocery Council - a good piece of work.

  I can assure the House that this side of the House has deployed and is deploying the full arsenal of measures that we have available to stop the boats. And we are funding those initiatives, as we set out in our policies before the election. And we are deploying those funds to achieve a very simple purpose - that is, to stop the boats. Since Operation Sovereign Borders commenced, the number of illegal boat arrivals to Australia has fallen by 75 per cent. I'll call that value for money.

  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.                     Madam Speaker, my apology - not a good start, Madam Speaker.                      Firstly, can I acknowledge the member for Macquarie particularly on her work in recent weeks with her community in relation to the bushfires which have caused so much damage. Congratulations. No wonder you have been sent back here for the fourth time, member for Macquarie.                  Of course you are right, the WestConnex investment will be a game-changing investment in Western Sydney, and to ensure that the Prime Minister is the infrastructure Prime Minister, this is a key measure to ensure our productivity performance increases. This is a project which is long overdue. It does make you wonder why for 20 years the Labor Party in New South Wales did not go ahead. What else they were up to in their time in government?                  This project will deal with a range of issues. It will deal with reducing travel times between Parramatta Road and Sydney airport by 40 minutes, which I thought the members of Western Sydney would appreciate. It will halve bus travel times between inner west and the city; it will bypass 52 sets of traffic lights; and it will remove 3,000 trucks a day from Parramatta road by putting them underground. It will lead to neighbourhood revitalisation and it will create some 10,000 jobs during construction, delivering more than $20 billion in economic benefits to New South Wales and to our country. It is of course our premier city and should have premier infrastructure, and it does not at this time. But with the infrastructure Prime Minister in charge, it will have again.                 We will ensure that not just in Sydney but also across Australia we will get our country moving. We will not be spending our money, our productive capacity, on pink batt programs and overpriced school halls. We will be focusing on economically productive infrastructure like the East West Link project in Melbourne, the Gateway North in Brisbane, the north-south in Adelaide and like the Perth Gateway and Swan Valley Bypass. We will be delivering projects across our country to lift our productive capacity.                 The truth is that we are facing a more difficult fiscal environment because the Labor Party has left a mountain of debt. We have asked the Productivity Commission to look at ways in which we can reduce the cost and the time of these projects and ensure that we get more for less and in quicker time. The Australian people are sick of governments talking about infrastructure; they actually want to see some infrastructure on the ground, particularly the WestConnex projects in Sydney. I congratulate Premier O'Farrell for getting on with the job and we know that with the infrastructure Prime Minister in charge Australia is once again open for business.                     No, they were confidential.                     No, I was referring to notes.                     the minister said he was reading from notes. He did not say they were confidential, and therefore he should table them. My point of order is that he should table the document. He has not said that it is confidential, therefore he should table it.                     You have to keep up. I did the first time!

  I thank the member for Bass for his question. Yes, I am aware that the unemployment rate in Tasmania is the highest in the country and I would say to Her Majesty's opposition that this is a national tragedy. It is not only that the unemployment rate is the highest in the country but that the participation rate is also the lowest. You might think this is a joke, but I do not think that the people of Tasmania believe unemployment is a joke, I am assured of that. I think that it comes as no surprise that the unemployment rate is so high because the great state of Tasmania has been subject to the twin evils of a Labor-Green alliance at a federal level and a Labor-Green alliance at a state level. It is no wonder that the Tasmanian economy was stagnating under that regime.                 But the coalition does have a plan. We have a plan to create a million jobs over five years and two million jobs over 10 years. Our plan starts with scrapping the job-destroying carbon tax and scrapping the job-destroying mining tax. And if the members of Her Majesty's opposition were serious about creating jobs they would get on side with the government - they would get on side with the government and support the repeal of those two job-destroying taxes.                 Specifically in relation to the issue of employment in Tasmania: we have a jobs plan for Tasmania to assist businesses to employ people - a plan to provide $3,250 to assist Tasmanian businesses to employ unemployed Tasmanians and unemployed eligible job seekers.                     This is an important initiative. We have also got, as part of our election commitments, a job commitment bonus to encourage young people into employment. We have got a relocation assistance plan to assist job seekers to move to where the jobs are and we have got a program which we will be putting in place to encourage employers to employ older Australians.                 I know that, unlike the members opposite, the member for Bass is concerned about the unemployment level in Tasmania. The member for Bass is concerned about the future of his state. The coalition has a plan for jobs. It is about time the opposition got out of the way.

  I do thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question and I am very pleased to say to him that the government stands by all its policies. We stand by all our policies and the reason why we stand by all our policies is, while they have not finally worked, they certainly are working. Illegal arrivals by boat are down by more than 75 per cent in the first two months of this government as opposed to the last two months of the former government and, frankly, members opposite are just a little bit embarrassed about the sorry state to which they reduced our country's border protection.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for that question. As a former police officer, we know that he understands the threat that criminal gangs pose to our lifestyle here in Australia. I also acknowledge that the member for La Trobe is the author of the policies that I now have the privilege of implementing to tackle gangs across the country, and that he authored them prior to the 2010 election.                 We know that bikie gangs are the public face of organised crime in Australia. They are involved in all aspects of criminal activity including gun-running, the illicit drugs trade, prostitution, extortion, money-laundering and the corruption of public officials. These gangs have national and often international dimensions and that is why they demand a national response. That is why the coalition is implementing our policy of a national antigang squad. I have had the privilege of rolling out the Queensland strike team with my colleague the Queensland police minister. I have announced the implementation of the Victorian strike team with the Victorian Premier and will soon be making further announcements about the strike team in New South Wales. I have also instructed that the Anti-gangs Intelligence Coordination Centre be moved from the Australian Federal Police to the Australian Crime Commission. This will be a one stop shop for intelligence for all police and law enforcement agencies across the country so they can tackle gangs within their own jurisdictions. It will link back to all aspects of Commonwealth law enforcement but also to other government agencies such as Centrelink, the Australian Taxation Office, and Customs and Immigration.                 Our approach to Commonwealth law enforcement is in stark contrast to what the previous government did. The funding cuts made by Labor to law enforcement - and the shadow communications minister should listen to this, because he was one of the ministers who was responsible for cutting the heart out of Commonwealth law enforcement - were $310 million and 97 officers cut from the Australian Federal Police. One-third of the budget of the Australian Crime Commission and one-third of the officers of that agency were cut by the Labor Party, as well as significant cuts to other Commonwealth law enforcement agencies.                 Despite the significant cuts that this shadow minister was responsible for as minister, our federal law enforcement agencies have been doing a very significant job - but they have been doing it with one hand tied behind their back by the cuts that the previous government made to federal law enforcement. I can send a message to Commonwealth law enforcement that the government has changed. Our priorities have changed, and they will now find the new Abbott government sees national law enforcement as a significant priority.

  I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that the important thing is how many boats this government has prevented from coming to Australia. That is the important thing. Illegal arrivals by boat are down by more than 75 per cent on the results achieved under the former government. I understand that members opposite are ashamed and embarrassed of their record. Frankly, if I were them, I would be ashamed and embarrassed of my record. But our record is better than theirs - it is much better than theirs -                      The most directly relevant thing that I can say to members opposite is that the boats are stopping. That is the most directly relevant thing that I can say to the opposition. On that note, after 21 questions I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.

  The government will not be supporting the opposition's campaign for the people smugglers' right to know. That is not something we are going to engage in. I am not going to rely on the previous statements I have made in this House about these matters - about operations that have resulted in a 75 per cent reduction in illegal arrivals to Australia by boat. I am going to rely on the words of the former Chief of the Defence Force, someone very well-known to the members of the opposition, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, who said this last Friday, which was not widely reported:                 I guess the military way of doing things is to operate with a higher degree of operational security to keep the people smugglers on the back foot, and I think that's really why there's a need for operational security, and that's why things are the way they are at the moment.                 That is what he said to Adam Spencer. This is what he said in a news radio interview. He said:                 There is a great advantage to have a high level of operational security which means you are not going to be transmitting frequently on what activities you are up to at that particular moment in time.                 If they refuse to listen to the government as to why it would be reckless and foolish to broadcast operational matters of this nature, which the former Chief of the Defence Force has described in these terms, then perhaps they will listen to the former chief of defence who, indeed, headed up the previous government's own expert panel.

  I do thank the member for Forrest for her question and I appreciate her concerns to ensure that every job be made more secure and every business made more competitive by the abolition of the carbon tax, which is doing enormous damage to job security and competitiveness right across our economy but particularly in an energy-intensive state such as Western Australia.                 If it is not repealed, the carbon tax will go up and up and up: $24 a tonne now, $38 a tonne in 2020 and an almost unimaginable $350 a tonne by 2050.                     They are the former government's own figures. If the carbon tax is not repealed, power prices will go up and up and up. They are is power prices that will damage businesses as well as hurt households. Right now power prices for the average Australian household are $200 a year more than they should be because of the carbon tax. Household costs are $550 a year more for the average household thanks to the carbon tax. But there is a simple way to get power prices down and that is to abolish the carbon tax. That is the simple way to get power prices down to take the pressure off households and to make every worker's job more secure.                 As the head of the ACCC said last week, 'What goes up with the carbon tax will come down with the abolition of the carbon tax.' Today there is more good news. The boss of Alinta Energy, one of the big energy producers in Western Australia, has said, 'Any cost savings associated with the carbon price repeal will be passed on to retail customers by Alinta Energy.'                 What is standing in the way of this benefit to business and to consumers? I will not talk about 'electricity bills', which we all know are far too high, but if the Leader of the Opposition does not want to be referred to by that term, there is a very simple thing he can do: get out of the way and let the carbon tax repeal bill be passed. Axe the tax and respect the will of the Australian people.

  Once again, I have answered this question. I know the opposition would like us to hand over the PIN for Operation Sovereign Borders to the people smugglers but we are not going to do that, because we are not in the business of helping people smugglers. I know those on the other side are seeking to champion their interests because right now, in the Senate -                      I am happy to assist you, Madam Speaker, and withdraw. The point I was seeking to make was that in the Senate at the moment the Greens have moved a motion - and it has been done, I understand, by the real shadow minister for immigration, Senator Hanson-Young - the deputy sits over here -                      I am simply seeking to explain.                     The point I was wishing to make is that those opposite are seeking to ensure that people who arrive in Australia illegally by boat - 33,000 who are sitting here today - get the permanent visas that their government promised them. In relation to matters that have been raised by the member, if there are any incidents that require explanation -                      I know members opposite are anxious about this issue and are sensitive about this issue, as they should be, because they allowed more than 50,000 people to turn up illegally on their watch. As is our practice under Operation Sovereign Borders, as the 'deputy shadow minister for immigration' over there would know, if there are serious incidents that require reporting in between reporting periods then they are reported.

  It is a very good question from the member for Hasluck because the mining tax is a burden on the people of Western Australia, as it is on all Australians. The mining tax is a budget disaster.                 Imagine introducing a tax that hardly raises any money, but then you go and spend all this money against a fictional revenue stream. That is exactly what the Labor Party did. It was originally to raise nearly $50 billion so they went on a spending spree against money that they never collected. In total, the tax raised $400 million - just $400 million. Fewer than 20 taxpayers have paid that $400 million. Around 145 other miners have been required to submit all the paperwork associated with the tax.                     I heard that interjection from the member over there. I just remind the House that the Labor Party are not very good with numbers, we know that. They certainly are not very good with budgets and they are most definitely not very good with other people's money. When I thought about why would you introduce a tax that does not raise any money I went to my old china plate over there, the member for Lilley. He summed it up in this year's budget. The member for Lilley said about the mining tax: 'We brought a super profits tax in precisely at the time the super profits disappeared.' And he is right. He is Mensa so he is right.                 The problem is that Labor is defending all this expenditure against this tax. So let us get it right: the tax does not raise any money; the tax has over $16 billion of expenditure against it; the tax leaves the budget $13½ billion worse off; the tax leaves the debt to increase by $13½ billion; the Labor Party say that they actually want to keep the tax; and the tax is a burden on 145 people who have to pay between $2 million and $20 million a year to comply with a tax that hardly raises any money. You guys are geniuses. Collectively, you are outstanding work. I say to the Labor Party, 'Respect the mandate of the Australian people; respect the mandate of the government.' As the Australian people did, you should vote to get rid of the mining tax. It is an insidious and flawed tax that only the Labor Party could come up with. Well done!

  I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. It was a wide-ranging question and I am not certain that I entirely follow every element of it. I am certainly not going to support every aspect of the former government's foreign policy in respect of Indonesia. Obviously, I deplore the Oceanic Viking stand-off. I deplore the live cattle ban that the former government applied misguidedly to Indonesia. Nevertheless, I am certainly not going to be critical of the former government's conduct in respect of intelligence. I do not believe that Australia should be expected to apologise for reasonable intelligence-gathering operations, just as I do not expect other countries or other governments to apologise for their reasonable intelligence-gathering operations.

  The member's electorate covers one of the most important industrial areas in our country. Mining, exports and minerals processing are all industries that are made less competitive because Labor put a carbon tax in place. So the real benefits to the people of Gladstone will be a stronger and more robust economy and more competitive industries. But it will also flow through to almost everything they do in their daily lives, whether it is the forklift in the factory; the council undertaking some roadworks; the boats, the dredges and the ferries working in Gladstone harbour; getting a ticket at the airport to fly to another part of the country; or getting on the tilt train in the morning. All of those costs are higher because of Labor's carbon tax.                  Let us never forget that on 1 July 2013, just as the leader who dumped the emissions trading scheme dumped the Prime Minister who promised we would not have a carbon tax ever, the carbon tax went up again. If Labor are allowed to keep their carbon tax in place, the prices will go up again and again. As if they have not done enough damage; Labor want to keep the carbon tax in place. In fact, they cannot make up their mind whether they want a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme. I think they want both. They want to put more penalties on the Australian people. They do not want Australian industries to be competitive and be able to deliver products at a competitive price around the world.                  The reality is that Labor are imposing a cost not just on ordinary Australians in their households, not just on the day-to-day things that we do in our lives but, worst of all, on our industry and on our national competitiveness. The answer to the people of Flynn and the answer to the people of Australia is for Labor to recognise that the people have spoken on this issue and to support us to axe the tax.

  I note that the member for Brisbane does not have media favourites so that is why she did not go down the path of naming all the publications, but it was widely published today. The fact is that Labor hid 14,500 job losses in the public sector before the election. How unbelievably embarrassing. Whoops, how did that happen? Fourteen and a half thousand people just lost their jobs under Labor in the public sector and they forgot to tell us about it.                 But if you believed the Shadow Treasurer this morning, he said at his press conference, 'It is all in there in all our economic statements released just before the last election.' I went thumbing through it again and I read it again and again. I even put a little orange tab here. It says nothing about 14,500 jobs in the public service. But it gets better. The Leader of the Opposition, as Minister for Workplace Relations in the previous government, on 16 August 2013 went to the union movement, the Commonwealth Public Sector Union, and said, 'We believe that the necessary savings should not impact unduly on the overall number of Public Service jobs.' Hang on, so there you have the Leader of the Opposition saying, 'Do not worry, we are going to have efficiency dividends but nobody is going to lose their job.' And then after the election we discover that 14,500 jobs are going in the public sector. But it was not just his spoken word but his written word as well to Nadine Flood, the national secretary of the CPSU. He said it is possible that public sector savings and the efficiency dividend outcome may be achieved through a range of measures including targeted non-staff savings at the agency and sector-wide levels and the possibility of mergers or a reduction in the Public Service. There was nothing about 14,500 jobs going under Labor as a result of their efficiency dividend.                 Senator Wong said, in estimates today, how did that happen? We asked for an efficiency dividend out of the public sector and oh my goodness aren't we surprised that there are job losses? The problem is: every cupboard we open on the budget there are more spiders put there by Labor. We went to the last election saying there would be 12,000 redundancies through natural attrition and every day we had to suffer the member for Griffith standing in this place talking about the job losses in Queensland and all the hypocrites on the Labor side talking about job losses under Campbell Newman.                     It is true; you are hypocrites.                     I withdraw. How sad it is for Australia that they were ever in government.

  I am really thrilled to get questions on this topic. And I am very pleased to say to the Leader of the Opposition we stand by all our policies. We stand by all of them because they are working. The boats have not entirely stopped but they are stopping. They are down almost 80 per cent in the first two months of this government compared with the last two months of the former government. That is good news for Australia, it is good news for the safety of life at sea, and it is good news for the strength of our relationship with Indonesia. The only people for whom it is not good news are members opposite, who are ashamed and embarrassed about their appalling record.

  I have seen the reports referred to by the member for Longman, and I can tell him that the government will respond by firstly reviewing our own promise made before the election: that we would have 12,000 reductions in the Public Service through natural attrition. The important thing is that we promised, before the election, and we were completely up-front and honest with the Australian public about our plans for the future - quite unlike the opposition.                  The second part of the question was about implications for the wider aspects of the government's plans. One of the things that need to be explained to the Australian public is that, as well as the previous government pretending that they would not be cutting anything from the Public Service while actually having secret plans to cut 14,500 public servants across the board, they had not funded their redundancies in the forward estimates in the budget. So in fact this is just another addition to the Bowen black hole that this government unfortunately inherited two months ago. The Bowen black hole will mean that the deficit and debt will increase because of the previous government's legacy to this new government. Indeed, this was one of the booby-traps that Labor left in the budget for the new government. This was one of the booby-traps from the boobies on that side of the House: a cut of 14,500 to the Public Service.                 It is even worse than that. The Leader of the Opposition himself - dripping all that sincerity that he likes to affect when he goes to various places around Australia - said at the CPSU conference in Melbourne on 16 August during the election campaign:                  As a Federal Minister for almost three years, I have had the privilege of a front row seat and gained a unique appreciation of the work that our public sector employees do for this country each and every day. Your stories go quietly on, a few attracting discreet bouquets. But so often you are the subject of economic vandalism inspired by conservative ideology. We all know the solution to our nation's challenges is not to cut to the bone.                 Tragically, he was not going to give them bouquets; he was planning on hitting them with an anvil after the election. But, thank goodness, he was not elected. The truth is: the coalition was entirely up-front with the public servants of Australia about our plans. I feel betrayed; but imagine those public servants who voted Labor, believing it would secure their jobs only to find that Labor was waiting for them with an anvil after the election.

  There is a very clear difference between the government and the opposition on this subject. We were absolutely honest and up-front with people before the election. We wanted to reduce the size of the Public Service by 12,000. Members opposite were just dishonest. It is as simple as that. They were simply dishonest. They were as dishonest about the Public Service before this election as they were dishonest about the carbon tax before the last election. This is why no-one can trust anything that Labor says.

  I thank the member for his question. It was indeed a great pleasure to meet with Nazifeh Yousefi and her family. They are an inspirational family, having come here from Iran after applying through our proper process. Her husband has joined her, and her children have studied, they have gone to university, and they have bought their own home in Townsville. They are an inspirational family.                  They came the right way. They will be encouraged by the fact that, under the coalition, no longer will an Australian government provide permanent visas that are intended for people like Nazifeh to people who have come illegally by boat. Under our program, we have made the change. We have reset the refugee and humanitarian program to ensure that not one of those visas will go to someone who has come the wrong way.                      Those interjecting opposite make a point and I would like to address it. They talk about their increase in the program to 20,000. Under the coalition's program there are 13,750 visas for the special humanitarian program and the refugee program and that is our program: 13,750. That is the entire program. Those opposite increased it to 20,000. What they did not say is that 7,000 of that 20,000 were going to be permanent protection visas for people who came illegally by boat. So their 20,000 figure was a big con. Not one of the 13,750 protection visas that we will give to deserving cases all around the world will go to someone who has arrived illegally by boat but they wanted to provide 7,000 out of their 20,000.                     As I was stating, the change we have made -                      There could be nothing more relevant in terms of the answer to the member's question that under this government we are not giving permanent visas to people who come the wrong way to Australia. So those who come the right way to Australia can expect the generous spirit and heart of the Australian people in the way we administer this program. What we have changed is we have increased the size of the special humanitarian program which under their government reduced to just 500 people. Under the Howard government it ran at an average of 5,000 a year. There are many victims of the previous government's policies and failures on border protection. We know of the deaths, we know of the cost to the budget, but there are those people who waited in camps like Nazifeh for decades while that government over the last six years handed out protection visas to people who came illegally by boat. And they still want to do it in the Senate - they still want to honour the people smugglers' promise because is that what they believe in.

  We topped up the capital of the Reserve Bank because capital had been stripped by the former government. It is as simple as that. We were advised by the Governor of the Reserve Bank that it was prudent to increase the capital and that is exactly what we have done. In respect of documents that have been sought by the Senate, our policy on this matter will be exactly the same as the policy of previous governments. It is probably worth reminding the former Treasurer that on at least 12 separate occasions the government in which he served refused to comply with an order of this sort from the Senate.                      I do not want to call them hypocrites because that would be outside the standing orders, but that is what they are.                     I withdraw.

  I thank the honourable member for her question. The honourable member remembers very well 12 July this year when the member for Chifley, then the parliamentary secretary for broadband, was in the Northern Territory switching on the NBN. The member for Chifley's powerful charisma was not the only thing the government was bringing to bear to this project. There was over $13 million in building costs, six visits by the former minister, Senator Conroy, and one visit from his successor, the member for Grayndler, who was there hauling fibre on 29 August.                 So all of that charisma and millions of dollars you would think an absolutely irresistible combination. Well, as we speak, in the Northern Territory, in built-up areas, there are 322 premises capable of getting a broadband service on the fibre network.                     But wait! There's more! Five have actually connected! People in the telecoms business, as the member for Chifley would know, are concerned about the cost of multiple truck rolls. This is a network that had multiple ministerial rolls! Senator Conroy went to the Northern Territory more often than there are active connections on the broadband network. You really could not make this up!                 The Northern Territory News should have this on the front page - they should have these connections on the front page. Madam Speaker, as you know, they love to have sightings of UFOs on the front page, and there are more of them than there are active customers! And they do like crocodiles as well, and what could be a bigger crock than Labor's propaganda during the election, claiming that connection to the NBN is free? Oh yes, it is free - at the current rate it is about $2 million a connected premises in the brownfield areas. That is hardly free.                 All of this has got to change. The adults are back in charge of the NBN. We are conducting a strategic review. On the board there was not one person with experience in the telecommunications industry - not one out of eight! That is not bad: how many people would appoint eight people to a board of a telecom project and have not one telecom person on the board? I tell you: only the Labor Party! Instead, we have four experienced lifelong telecom people on that board, and we will get this project completed sooner, cheaper and more affordably.

  I am pleased to receive a question from the member for Lalor. What I can say is that following the disturbing evidence around the creation, allocation and distribution of the Early Years Quality Fund, when I was sworn in as minister I commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers to conduct a report. That report has recently -                      I am not sure, Madam Speaker, whether members opposite actually want to hear the update on the Early Years Quality Fund - maybe they do not.                 The report has been received, I am in the process of digesting its contents and I will have something to say about the future of the Early Years Quality Fund. But there is something I want to add, because my understanding is that the member for Lalor is a teacher and therefore she should be concerned, as she appears to be, about the wages of teachers. But the one thing that stood out - and I do not need PricewaterhouseCoopers to tell me this - is that the fund of which she speaks could only cover 30 per cent of the workforce in the long day care sector, which is a tiny proportion of the overall workforce.                 So, Madam Speaker, if you were at the community preschool at Moonee Ponds you could never have received an allocation from the Early Years Quality Fund. If you worked in out-of-school-hours care, or if you worked in occasional care or if you worked as an early childhood teacher in something other than long day care you could never have received an allocation from the Early Years Quality Fund. I wonder why not. Because union members do not appear in those sectors of the childcare workforce.                 So what this Labor Party did in government was provide a small amount of money in a fund for 30 per cent of a subset of the workforce for just two years. Do you know what the really interesting thing is about the opposition minister who presided over this flawed public policy, Madam Speaker? When this fund opened for business, do you know how long it took? I have mentioned the small quantum - it was exhausted in 12 hours. Just 12 hours! Did the then minister deign to let the sector know that there was no point in putting in their applications? No, because every single application came with lodgements of your EBA with the Fair Work Commission and more union members in your workplace. So I make no apologies for commissioning this report to clean up Labor's mess.

  Thank you, and welcome back to the member for Fisher - a different seat, but we look forward to the same strong, intelligent contribution to the national debate after an era where intelligent contributions were sadly lacking.                 I did indeed visit the now member for Fisher during the election campaign, and came to understand the particular struggles and issues on the Sunshine Coast. I know that his constituents, the educators and the providers in his electorate will have a chance to talk about what they would like to see in the future of childcare policy under this government. The government is going out to ask people what they want, not telling people what they think they need.                 The member for Fisher asked for reactions and I am really happy to report that the love is spreading for the Productivity Commission inquiry. Goodstart Early Learning has recognised that it is a once-in-a-decade opportunity to get Australia's policy settings right to deliver access to affordable, high-quality child care and early learning for Australian families. That is the largest single non-profit provider of child care. The Australian Childcare Alliance that represents 70 per cent of long day care centres throughout the country believes that it is timely that this review occurs as the sector is struggling under the burden of red tape and the assessment and rating process. And our friends at United Voice have issued this media release that says 'Educators welcome childcare inquiry'.                 I know that there are members opposite who have close links with the union United Voice. Maybe the member for Port Adelaide and the member for Werriwa and the newly elected Senator Sue Lines and Senator Penny Wong might like to talk to the shadow minister, who does not like the current Productivity Commission inquiry into child care, and remind the shadow minister that their union has said:                 Everyone involved in the system - parents, educators and providers have been talking about the crisis for years.                  Six years, in fact. It goes on:                 The Productivity Commission inquiry is a real chance for the new Government to make changes that will see a higher quality education and care.                 And United Voice very helpfully makes a point that I often make, that quality early childhood education and care 'has a direct impact on the economy because it is the vital factor in women's workforce participation'. I am delighted to report that the Productivity Commission inquiry is launched and is underway and we have good things to look forward to.

  I am pleased to take a question about the special child care benefit because I know, as I know the member who has asked the question does, that when it comes to supporting children with special needs in child care there really is not a higher priority. I have had some briefings recently on the special child care benefit because I felt it was inadequate under the previous government and I have sought whether there are short-term ways that we can improve the assistance to those families. I do not want to make the issue of the special child care benefit and its assistance for vulnerable families and children a political issue in this place, so if the member has any particular issues relating to her electorate about affected families I am happy to take those and seek the appropriate advice. When it comes to the Productivity Commission inquiry, that will look, of course, at all payments to families, but there is no intention - not on my part and I know not on the part of any commissioner within the PC or any member on this side - to make any cuts to an important support for vulnerable families.

  Congratulations to the new member for Hindmarsh for an outstanding maiden speech yesterday. It is great that the western suburbs of Adelaide have finally got some good Liberal representation after all these years. Madam Speaker, as you are well aware, the Prime Minister will be, at the end of his term, the infrastructure Prime Minister. That is the intention of the Prime Minister and we will make sure that he is the infrastructure Prime Minister during his term.                 Yesterday we talked about the WestConnex project in Sydney and its importance to the people of Western Sydney in particular in Australia's premier city. Today we talk about the north-south corridor project and particularly for those in Hindmarsh affected by this, being in the most liveable city in Australia. We want to make the north-south corridor a reality as soon as we possibly can. We are not just going to talk about it; we are going to deliver on it. In the election campaign we committed to $500 million to upgrade the Darlington Interchange. I noticed yesterday that the former minister -                      who longs to be back on this side of the House, was critical of the government standing by its election promise. I know it is an unusual concept for the Labor Party, but we announced $500 million for Darlington in the campaign and we are going to deliver $500 million for Darlington. I know for the Labor Party that is a very unusual thing to happen. In October at the South Australian Liberal Party conference the Prime Minister, in what was an ambitious announcement, said that this government, the Abbott government, will deliver an entire north-south corridor upgrade in our term in government.                     I am surprised that the member for Kingston and the member for Adelaide are so opposed to this. I am surprised that their constituents would be so opposed. I understand the member for Kingston is very disappointed that her own party would not commit to the Darlington Interchange, but we will commit to the Darlington Interchange and we will get the Torrens-to-Torrens work underway. We will continue to ensure - what's wrong, Albo?                     He is increasingly looking like one of those Japanese troops who were left on an island, forgetting that the war was over. The war is over, Albo! We put a proposition to the electorate and they supported ours.                     It is a surprise that the member for Kingston would not support the southern suburbs of Adelaide, I must say. I am not surprised the member for Adelaide and the member for Port Adelaide do not support it, but the member for Kingston? We will deliver the north-south corridor. The infrastructure Prime Minister will ensure that the north-south corridor is upgraded for the benefit of South Australia and the people of Australia. We will be a government that is open for business under the infrastructure Prime Minister.

  My commitment to the Leader of the Opposition is that we will fully honour our election commitment. That is what we will do. We will fully honour our election commitments. I know that members opposite are flabbergasted at that, absolutely flabbergasted, because they have never honoured any election commitment.                 On that note, Madam Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.

  This is a serious matter and it is a serious question from the Leader of the Opposition. As I said yesterday, I deeply and sincerely regret the embarrassment that media reports have caused to President Yudhoyono who is a very good friend of Australia - perhaps one of the very best friends that Australia has anywhere in the world. I do understand how personally hurtful these allegations, these reports, have been for him and his family.                  I do note that there have been allegations and even admissions in the past on this subject. People did not overreact then and I certainly do not propose to overreact now. My intention, notwithstanding the difficulties of these days, is to do everything I reasonably can to help to build and strengthen the relationship with Indonesia which is so important for both our countries.

  I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question and I congratulate him on his excellent maiden speech yesterday. The carbon tax certainly is hurting businesses and costing jobs right around Australia, particularly in the small businesses of which the member spoke so eloquently yesterday.                  Over the past year I have visited at least 80 businesses right around our country that are being hurt by the carbon tax, including quite a few in his electorate of Eden-Monaro, such as ACT Steelworks, a small business which is going to be thousands of dollars a year worse off because of the carbon tax.                  In every single one of those businesses right around the country, the workers of Australia have had a very simple message: axe the tax - axe the tax which is making their jobs less secure and hurting their prospects of future employment.                  So the good news is that the government has been elected to do just that: to axe the tax. The bad news is that members opposite are still in denial, which raises a question: just who are the real friends of the workers of this country? Is it the party who wants to take taxes off them and improve their job security or is it the party that thinks that what the workers of Australia need is just more taxes?                  Under members opposite, unemployment queues lengthened by 200,000, because this was a government that just did not get it when it came to the economy. Under the former coalition government we had two million new jobs created, and that is precisely the record that this government is determined to emulate.                  It is very clear exactly what the situation is here: the former government left a mess; the new government has been elected to fix it. We are fixing up the mess, and it is high time that members opposite got out of the way of the repair job that this country so desperately needs.

  I thank the honourable member and recognise what a magnificent contribution the mining industry makes to his electorate and the people of South Australia, Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and Victoria - I am not sure about the ACT. There are 270,000 people directly employed in the mining industry in Australia and over 800,000 other Australians rely on the mining industry for related employment.                  It is hugely important for the generation of wealth right across the nation, representing around 55 per cent of merchandise exports from Australia. Yet it is 10 per cent of GDP. So the mining industry is hugely important. It helped, unquestionably, to get us through the challenging times of the global financial crisis -                      Well, I can tell you, it wasn't old Swanee who got us through; it was a hell of a lot of iron ore that went out the door. The member for Lilley and the member for Griffith, what did they do? They wanted to tax it. As the member for Lilley said, 'It was a historic reform to tax the mining industry.' Damn right it was, because, and I quote him:                 We brought a superprofits tax in precisely at the time the superprofits disappeared.                 That is another great 'Swanism'. The fact is: the mining tax actually leaves the budget worse off. I know it is very hard for our friends in the Greens to understand this. I heard the member for Melbourne this morning on the doors and I nearly choked on my Weeties. I only have three Weeties these days -                      Three small ones. I heard the member for Melbourne say, 'We need to have a mining tax to generate all that revenue to get the debt down.' The problem is that the mining tax actually does not benefit the budget; it costs the budget $13½ billion. Here is an interesting concept for the member for Melbourne and the members of the Labor Party. If you have only this much revenue and you have this much expenditure against it, you leave the budget worse off. The mining tax leaves the budget $13½ billion worse off. So the best thing that the Labor Party and their mates in the Greens could do - sorry, their mate in the Greens - would be to get rid of the damn mining tax and let the mining industry get on with the job.

  The member for Corio has asked me about paying for boats. The Australian people have had to pay more than $11.6 billion in budget blow-outs because of the former government's border protection failures, 800 boats with more than 50,000 people who came on -

  I do thank the member for Denison for his question. It is a very important subject.                 On the freight equalisation scheme, let me remind the member that the Fraser government created it, the Howard government improved it and the current government will retain it and improve it. To that end, we are shortly going to announce a joint Productivity Commission-ACCC inquiry into improving the freight arrangements between Tasmania and the mainland and the wider world.                 But the member is absolutely right: there have been considerable brakes on development in Tasmania. One brake on development in Tasmania was the Labor-Green government in Canberra, now gone. The other brake on development in Tasmania is the Labor-Green government in Hobart which, hopefully, will be gone after March of next year.                 But there have been very serious economic issues in Tasmania. I regret to say that Tasmania has our nation's highest unemployment, it has our lowest wages and it has our lowest rate of educational attainment, and this is why the government has a plan for Tasmania. The centrepiece of the plan for Tasmania is $400 million to upgrade the Midland Highway, $38 million to upgrade the airport at Hobart - an initiative that I know had the strong support of the member for Denison - and $24 million dollars to create a world-class Antarctic research centre in Hobart. We are doing what is needed to restore the Tasmanian economy, because Tasmania needs to be an economy as well as just a national park.                 That is what Tasmania needs, and the people of Tasmania understand that. That is why there was such a massive swing at the recent election, to give us - with a 13 per cent swing - a new member for Lyons, and with swings of almost the same magnitude new members for Bass and for Braddon. I say to the member for Denison: you work together with these three great new members and the four of you will do a very good job by the great state of Tasmania.

  I am delighted to take a question from my friend the member for MacPherson, I think the first female engineer to graduate from Queensland University of Technology - a female engineer who clearly understands the building and construction task ahead of us as we enter government.                 I enjoyed visiting the member for McPherson's electorate on a previous occasion and talking to two childcare centres, one located at Currumbin and one at Burleigh Heads, looking after 130 children. The operator mentioned that his electricity costs have increased directly by $1,000 a year per centre as a result of the carbon tax. So every time somebody turns on the light in those childcare centres, turns on the dishwasher, turns on the oven to cook the patty cakes, goes out in the garden, opens the fridge to get out the juices for play lunch, turns on the tap -                      turns on the tap to have water pouring in the back garden or even takes delivery of the soft fall in the playground, that is a carbon tax on every stage of the process.                     Childcare centres are not big polluters, not big polluters at all, but they bear, and they continue to bear, the cost of Labor's carbon tax, running as they do on wafer-thin margins. At the end of the line there is only one place these centres are going, and that is to the parents of Australia to raise childcare fees and costs, which is what we have seen under six years of Labor.                 The shadow minister stepped up, obviously feeling a bit tetchy about this, and made a personal explanation yesterday, in response to my comment that childcare costs were going up by only 57 cents a week. She said, 'Oh, that was a report. I read that in a report and that's why I said it.' What this shadow minister should have done and what members of the opposition should have done during her time is actually visit the childcare centres and facilities in their electorates and talk to the people who work in child care every day, and understand the real 44 per cent increase that is the reality about the increase in costs.                 We are surrounded by red tape and regulation and, Member for McPherson, I look forward to your constituents telling us what we can do to improve the amount of red tape. I have my friend the member for Kooyong in evangelical mode, corralling ministers and demanding to know where their red-tape dollars lie. I will certainly be providing the information to him, because there are numerous examples of how costs are increasing beyond the scope of everyday parents. We look forward to costs coming down.

  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.                     I thank the member for Dawson for his question.                     The member for Dawson, unlike the member for Isaacs, has a very good understanding of what the carbon tax and the mining tax are doing to the coal industry, not only in Queensland but across this nation. We have seen across the coal industry, as the member mentioned, some 8,000 jobs lost in Queensland in the last 18 months. I noticed the member for Isaacs was good enough to say, hopefully loud enough so it was heard, that the coal industry is going well. Can I assure you, Member for Isaacs, that it is doing nothing of the sort - and thank you for admitting that your carbon tax and your mining tax, which you were an integral part of introducing, are part of that problem. You said the coal industry was doing well, and it is not. The reasons for that are the carbon tax and the mining tax, amongst other issues.                 If you want to restore confidence to an industry you do not tax it. If you want to restore confidence to an industry you get rid of the taxes. You get rid of the mining tax. You get rid of the carbon tax. You remove the cost impediments, but not only to the industry - because only the Labor Party could introduce a tax that actually costs money. They introduced a tax that locked in $16.7 billion worth of spending on a tax that raised a mere $400 million.                     If the member for Moreton would listen he would learn something. It costs, on top of those losses, another $50 million to collect by the ATO. This is a disastrous tax. Then you combine it with the carbon tax, which is a $9 billion hit on industry and resources in Australia and you wonder why the coal industry is doing so badly at the moment.                 The coalition is intent not only on removing these taxes but restoring confidence to industry and resources. The member for Dawson has shown over the last three years as the member for that seat that when you support an industry, when you protect and work with an industry, the community actually understands you are trying to save the industry. So despite the downturn in his electorate, despite the fact that things are getting tough in Mackay, despite the fact that the Labor Party went to war on the resources sector, I have to report that the member for Dawson was returned with an increased majority. That is not just because of that; it is also because he works so hard across the many other issues in his electorate. Madam Speaker, if those on the other side want to end the vandalism of the resources sector that they introduced then I suggest they get out of the way and let us repeal the carbon tax and the mining tax.

  I welcome the member for Oxley's inaugural question. There is a simple theory that I think those opposite need to come to terms with, and that is: benefits that you offer need to be paid for. We are just having this discussion and if I could characterise it in the same way the Treasurer did, a tax that raises that much, but spends that much, leaves this much in between that is not funded. I would suspect, like many in the small business community, that not only did the coalition recognise that Labor had made promises it could not cash, but Labor would have revisited these measures themselves. Labor went around the country being completely overstated in the way in which they characterised these benefits. This was never a tax cut. This was rephasing of depreciation allowances that we are keeping but recognising: if you front-end load those depreciation allowances, and argue that they help cash-strapped small businesses, that small businesses actually need to have the ready cash available - so cash-strapped are they - to claim these benefits some months down the track.                 In addition, this was also the measure that saw the abolition of the entrepreneurs tax offset. From the cacophony that is coming from the opposite side, I wonder whether they realise that they were party to the abolition of the entrepreneurs tax offset. That was a discount available to Australia's 400,000 smallest businesses earning modest income, that got a slight incentive, introduced by the Howard government, to recognise their effort and their enterprise. This mining tax that you talk about has not raised anywhere near the amount you talked about and cannot fund any of the promises that you said it would, and it has imposed compliance burdens that burden everybody, even if they are not paying it, and has even included the abolition of a modest tax incentive for those courageous small businesses, 400,000 of them. And it was not just companies but independent contractors, partnerships and self-employed people who were all forced to pay higher taxes on their modest incomes as a result of your changes.                 I think that the best thing Labor could do is be honest with the small business community. They overcooked it when they were in government. They talked about delivering benefits that never arose. They put out newsletters saying that they had delivered a reduction in company tax - that never arose either.                     One thing that the small business community has learned from Labor is that you cannot trust what they say. They are always overcooking it. It is always about political spin. You have not heard the small business community at the election and you have not respected the election result. If you had you would hear the small business community as a single chorus saying: 'You want to help us? Axe the carbon tax.'

  Madam Speaker, may I congratulate you on your elevation to the high office which you occupy. I thank the member for Deakin for his question and, in doing so, can I acknowledge the impressive maiden speech that he made in this place this week and his obvious concern for the constituents of Deakin, including the residents of the aged-care homes at Strathdon and Heritage Gardens in his electorate.                 The member for Deakin asked me about the cost of living. We know that one of the major contributors, one of the major factors, in rising cost-of-living pressures for Australians both young and old is the carbon tax. Whilst the carbon tax remains in place there will be higher costs for ordinary Australians - higher energy costs and higher electricity costs - and that is the reason the government wants to repeal the carbon tax. A repeal of the carbon tax would benefit Australian households by $550 per year. So that is a win for Australians.                 But that is not all. This government also proposes to maintain the Household Assistance Package. That means more assistance for 3.2 million pensioners in Australia - 280,000 holders of the Commonwealth seniors health card, 1.6 million Australian families, one million recipients of allowances from government and, from the first of next year, 300,000 young people. That is not only a win in repealing the carbon tax but a win in terms of the retention of the Household Assistance Package. In addition to that, the government's recent decision to reduce the deeming rates benefits some 740,000 pensioners in Australia. So this parliament can do something about the cost-of-living pressures on ordinary Australians including the residents of the aged-care homes in the honourable member for Deakin's electorate. It can do something by respecting the will of the Australian people and abolishing the carbon tax.                  In the last parliament the member for Deakin was a member of the Labor Party. In this parliament the member for Deakin sits on the government benches. That is another clear example of the will of the Australian people repeated right across this country on the question of abolishing the carbon tax. Get out of the way of the will of the Australian people. Axe the tax and do something to ease the cost of living for Australians.

  The best thing that we can do for the families of Australia is to precisely honour the commitments that we made to them at the election. They know our country is in a mess. They know that Labor has created a mess. That is why they changed the government and now, having got our country into a mess, members opposite are obstructing the clean-up. Shame on them, Madam Speaker. The best thing we can do for the people of Australia is get rid of the carbon tax, and members opposite should not be standing in the way of that.

This government will honour the commitments it took to the election.                     I know that is an alien concept for the Labor Party.

  I thank the honourable member for his question about his electorate of Boothby. I regret to say that there are none - zero - brownfield premises passed in his electorate with the NBN fibre, and consequently it will surprise him that there are no connections. No-one is paying for a service.                 This is not surprising. In South Australia, since the initial connection in 2011 of 700 premises in Willunga in a trial, there has been virtually no progress at all. At the time of the election, only an additional 69 brownfield premises had been connected -                      in the whole state - only an additional 69. We recall the Labor Party talking about the project being about to ramp up. Well, there was a ramp, but it was all down.                 Of course, this abject failure to deliver could not dampen the enthusiasm of the honourable members opposite. On 28 August, the Hungarian Club in Norwood, in Adelaide, was witness to an NBN forum. The member for Chifley was there. The member for Adelaide was there. It was to update constituents on the progress of the NBN. I have the invitation here. But there seems to have been a typo, because the meeting was scheduled for an hour, which seems a very long time to discuss the fact that in Adelaide there were no premises passed and none connected. Of course, the member for Adelaide may have allocated the time to explain how this zero result could be reconciled with her announcement in July 2010 that Prospect was next in line for the NBN, or indeed that construction had commenced in November 2011.                 But these, while consistent with Senator Farrell's spin, are small beer compared to Prime Minister Gillard telling Australians on 20 December 2010:                 _ the NBN can be delivered with a rate of return, which means taxpayers will be repaid their investment in the NBN with interest _                 That was echoed by her colleague Senator Conroy at the same press conference, who said: 'NBN Co.'s expected rate of return is seven per cent, which compares favourably with the average 10-year bond rate to September 2010 of 5.4 per cent. That means the government can expect to recover all of its NBN Co. funding costs with interest.' The only problem was that this was one month - only one month - after the government received advice from Lazard, the investment bank, that the NBN project had a negative value of $31 billion. No wonder Australians lost faith in Labor. No wonder they are sick of their spin.

  I thank the member for Charlton for his question. There is a reality that does not seem to have dawned upon the members of the Australian Labor Party. That reality is that their party when in government ran budget deficit after budget deficit after budget deficit. We have now inherited the Bowen black hole. We have a huge debt, which has been expanding every year since -                      I will tell you who this is offensive to: it is offensive to the Australian people, who are now struggling with the debt that you left them. That is the reality.                     Oh, my, how sensitive they are when we talk about the deficits and the debt mountain they have left the Australian people. Do not come in here and ask stupid questions.

  I commend the member for her question.                     I know that the previous member for Lindsay had a very keen interest in the issue of border protection. Those who were here at the time remember good old 'Commander' Bradbury, who accompanied the then Prime Minister all the way to Darwin. That is a long way from Penrith. He was not looking for the Nepean Belle, I am sure.                     I remember that the previous member for Lindsay had to endure, day after day, week after week and year after year, questions and other things being raised with him by his own constituents because of the failures of the previous government.                     At the heart of the previous government's failures was their decision, as the member for Lindsay has reminded the House, to abolish offshore processing. They also abolished temporary protection visas. Even to this day those on that side of the House remain divided about temporary protection visas being restored. It is no surprise that we have had to restore offshore processing in the way it was designed, because those opposite never, ever believed in it. The Leader of the Opposition in particular I note described offshore processing in these terms:                  Howard's Pacific Solution is taking Australia down a sterile, dirty and nasty path.                 That is what the Leader of the Opposition actually thinks about offshore processing. He said on another occasion:                 Howard's -                  not Mr Howard's -                  actions undermine humanitarian values, and stir division within the Australian community.                  What I notice is that the only division that is stirred on the issue of offshore processing and temporary protection visas is on that side of the House, because they have always been divided on the issue of offshore processing -                      and that is why they could never implement it properly. They could never implement it properly, because they did not believe in it. So since the government were elected we have had to go about the process of putting it back in place in the way it was designed.                  Under the previous government, when they were dragged kicking and screaming to reintroduce offshore processing, one in 20 people who arrived illegally by boat was sent to Nauru and Manus Island. At the eleventh hour, when they confected a press conference - it was not implementation of a policy; it was just a press conference - we inherited a policy that was unfunded, was under capacity and had been constantly undermined by the previous government in its implementation. That is why the Australian people threw them out - because they did not trust them to run offshore processing.                     They know that those on this side of the House believe in offshore processing, and under the new government I am pleased to say that it is back in business the way it was designed.

  We went to the election being absolutely honest and up-front with the people of Australia. We were absolutely honest and up-front with the people of Australia that we could not continue unfunded benefits. We could not continue with benefits which were simply a cash splash with borrowed money. We were totally honest with the people before the election. The people elected us and we will faithfully discharge our obligations to them; we will faithfully honour the commitments that we made to them. And the best thing members opposite could do for the families of Australia, if they are as concerned as they say they are, is abolish the carbon tax. If they abolish the carbon tax, that will save the average Australian household $550 a year. Do not sneer at a saving of $550 a year. It is a very considerable saving, and it is entirely in accordance with the commitments that this government made and that this government intends to honour.

  Madam Speaker, thank you very much. No amount of defence by the member will defend the record of the former minister for health. This is a shocking record.                 I want to talk about the GP Super Clinics Program -                      And she's arcing up already!                     I withdraw. My intention here is to provide a factual recount of the failings of the former minister. Let me start with the GP superclinic program. We heard the other day about the government's failure to provide one dollar of additional funding for chemotherapy patients beyond 31 December this year. They were saying to patients who needed chemotherapy services in this country that they would not get the extra service they needed beyond 31 December, but it does not stop there. Their problem is -                      This goes to the competence of the former government. It does not just apply to the NBN or pink batts or the running up of $373 billion of debt; this government presided over a $650 million superclinic program that was a complete and utter failure.                 _ it is not in order for Ministers to be questioned on opposition policies, for which they are not responsible.                 It was a page of Practice oft quoted in the previous parliament, as you would remember, Madam Speaker. And, given that it was not within the question, it cannot be relevant and neither was it within his responsibilities.                     So the superclinic the honourable member inquired about was announced, believe it or not, on 6 November 2007. You would have thought that for $5 million you would have got something by 2012 or 2013. But it is still not open. It is still not open for $5 million.                 During that time we have had two Labor Prime Ministers, three federal elections and two Labor health ministers, but not one patient has been seen by this clinic. I say to the Australian public: if you wonder why waiting lists have blown out, if you wonder why money has been wasted in health, it is because the Labor way was not to spend money on patients; it was to spend it on Labor bureaucracies. The problem was that Labor built up bureaucracies, taking money away from patients and not spending it on these clinics. We know that, out of the clinics promised as far back as 2007, 10 have not even yet been started.                  The incompetence of the Labor government knew no bounds. It did not just apply to their incompetence in child care or in broadband or in relation to the economy; the Labor Party were completely and utterly hopeless when it came to the Health portfolio. And there is a lot more yet to be detailed in relation to the former minister's failings.

  Let me say it again for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition and members opposite and people right around the country: we are going to implement the commitments that we made to the Australian people. Unlike members opposite, we were absolutely up-front with them before the election. We were absolutely honest and up-front about the various programs that we were going to axe and about the various programs that we were going to continue. We were absolutely honest and up-front with the Australian people before the election.                  They voted for us knowing that it wasn't all going to be beer and skittles. It wasn't all going to be handouts. It certainly wasn't going to be all debt and deficit, which is what they had come to expect from members opposite. What we are not going to do is continue cash splashes with borrowed money. That is the Labor way; it is not the coalition's way and, frankly, it is not what the Australian people deserve. We will honour our commitments. If members opposite were fair dinkum about doing the right thing by the families of Australia, they would allow us to get on with repealing the carbon tax and giving the households of Australia $550 a year extra.

  I thank the member for Hughes for his question. He is a member who has argued strongly for the service men and women in his electorate. Let me thank you for standing side by side with some of your units during some very difficult times during the year.                  It is right, Member for Hughes, that you should ask about future plans to address the mess that Labor has left within the Defence budget. Be under no doubt that this is an unmitigated mess that we have inherited.                  Last week we had the somewhat unedifying spectacle of the departmental secretary coming out to confirm what we have known for five years and what Labor have been in denial about - that they have taken a hatchet to the Defence budget over the last half decade. But, not to be outdone, this week alone that great fiscal luminary the former Labor defence minister Stephen Smith is reported as saying that Defence reforms could not be fulfilled because of the over $21 billion that the former Labor government ripped out of the Defence budget. 'Labor lag shoots defence in the foot' is a piece in The Australian that I table. That is an absolute admission of the failures and the mess that that former Labor government left behind.                 When you have senior Defence personnel joking that Labor 'simply used the Defence budget as an ATM' - bill after bill after bill pulled out of the ATM - you realise that that is Labor's way. It was always about Bill, wasn't it? The lowest level of Defence expenditure since 1938 as a proportion of GDP - that is your bill legacy; or is it simply the legacy of Bill? I am not really sure. But when you pull means of exchange -                      I was simply referring to the means of exchange which are sometimes grubby, faceless and dirty. But, then again, I apologise. I withdraw, Leader of the Opposition.                 Can I say to the member for Hughes that there is a better way. We as a government actually know where the deposit button is on the ATM. All that former government knew was where the withdrawal button was. So what we are going to say, Member for Hughes, and what you can take back to your electorate, is that under this government there will be no cuts to the defence budget. Under this government we will increase defence as a proportion of GDP to two per cent by 2022, and we will put back the money that that former Labor government recklessly pulled out. Under this government we will actually reinvest any money that is saved from the defence budget, as opposed to the last government, which pulled money out under the Strategic Reform Program and put nothing in. We will take a measured, purposeful and deliberate approach to restoring the finances.

  I thank the member for her question, and I echo the thoughts that we all have for those who have suffered from the bushfires. Our thoughts are with them at a difficult time of recovery, and we are very fortunate that the firefighters have made such a wonderful contribution to their communities. In addition to that effort, there is also a concerted and coordinated effort to help those communities recover. I acknowledge my friend and colleague Mrs Markus, who has done an outstanding job supporting her community. We have already seen the activation of the immediate defence response arrangements, and some of that includes assistance for small business. Unless you missed it, you would have seen that those small businesses directly affected by the natural disaster also have access to assistance. What is different and what we are implementing is our election commitment to provide concessional loans to small businesses that have been indirectly affected.                 I am sure the member would realise that if your entire business interests are affected by a natural disaster, even though your business might not be in the area that is affected, it can have enormous implications for your business. I am proud to have supported and to have worked alongside our Prime Minister on this, after six years when Labor did not have the wit, could not see those connections, failed to act and was completely incapable of recognising those indirect effects. What you have seen is our government implementing those commitments. I acknowledge the Minister for Justice for his contribution to that work. I acknowledge the Minister for Human Services. I thank the Prime Minister for embracing this policy initiative. We continue to roll out our response in partnership with the New South Wales government to support those affected communities. And guess what? It includes the indirect impacts on small businesses, an insightful measure advocated by the coalition that your crowd did not have the wit to get onto in six years. We are getting on with implementing our commitments.                 While I am on that topic: why don't you let us get on with all of our commitments in the small business portfolio - like the abolition of the carbon tax, like implementing our commitment to improve the mining tax, like getting red tape and compliance burdens down, like doing all those things to put the business back into small business? Not only are we doing this for those communities not affected by natural disasters; we are doing it for those communities who are directly affected by natural disasters, and we are implementing our policy commitment to support those businesses indirectly affected by natural disasters. Why don't you just support that effort and recognise that it is a measure you guys did not have the wit to implement in six years?

  I thank the member for Mitchell. I acknowledge his ongoing and tireless support for the small businesses and family enterprises in his community. He, like all of us on this side of the House, recognises that small businesses and family enterprises are the lifeblood of so many communities right across our continent. We on this side of the House also recognise - yet to be appreciated by Labor - that the carbon tax was a very cruel measure inflicted on small businesses and family enterprises. When the former Prime Minister stared down the barrel of the television camera and said, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' the vast majority of small businesses, perhaps unwisely, actually believed her. They had not made preparations for a carbon tax, because they were promised they would not have one.                  After that, the Greens-Labor alliance saw the introduction of a carbon tax, and alongside it there were all sorts of carve-outs, compensation and claims that it was going to be such an enormous financial trigger that it would change behaviour - but, just in case it harmed somebody, here is some compensation. Do you know who was left out of that entire equation? Do you know who received no direct compensation and none of the carve-outs? The small business community. They were told by Labor to either suck up the additional cost and have a further impact on the viability of their businesses or pass it on to consumers. In electorates like Mitchell, where there are a lot of small businesses already facing the stiff headwinds introduced by Labor into their economies, struggling to keep their heads above water, here was yet another cost, another imposition. They saw that cost come through in their direct energy costs. So, if you owned a cafe and used electricity to do your skinny lattes or to heat up your toasted sandwiches, if you owned an ice-cream shop where you had to keep your stock cool, if you owned a corner store where you just wanted to have the drinks cold or, heaven forbid, if you owned a milk bar where you wanted to keep your pies in the fridge until they were needed, all of those costs were going up. And it was not only the direct costs but all the embedded costs, the costs that were in the supply chain - all building through to the small business. That meant that small business was put into a corner and, in addition to the insult of being told there would not be a carbon tax, there was then the economic injury of having one with no direct compensation to support that additional burden on their business. We are going to relieve that burden. It is our commitment to remove this carbon tax.                 The small business community are a single chorus across our country saying, 'Get rid of the carbon tax.' The carbon tax impacts on employment, on business viability and on costs. It is a drain and a drag on the enterprise of courageous small business men and women. Let us listen to the small business community and axe that carbon tax.

  I do thank the member for Reid for his question. I welcome him to the House and I congratulate him on the really warm, genial and generous maiden speech that he made earlier in the week. The member for Reid has just voted to repeal the carbon tax. In fact, every member of the coalition has just voted to repeal the carbon tax. The coalition went to the election promising to repeal the carbon tax, and I am proud to be able to say in this House that we are keeping faith with the mandate that we sought from the people. By contrast, Madam Speaker, every single member of the Labor Party has just voted to keep the carbon tax. They said before the 2010 election that there would never be a carbon tax and they said before the election a couple of months ago that the carbon tax had been terminated, and yet this tax which they say has been terminated they have just voted to keep. That is what members opposite have done.                     Madam Speaker, you can understand the member for Kennedy's enthusiasm to repeal the carbon tax, an enthusiasm which ought to shared by members opposite, because in voting to keep the carbon tax, this is what they have voted to do: they have voted to keep every household's costs $550 a year higher than they should be. They have voted to keep domestically-produced cars $400 more expensive than they should be. They have voted to keep gas bills $70 a year higher than they should be. They have voted to cut our aluminium production by 60 per cent by 2050; to cut our iron and steel production by 20 per cent by 2050. They have voted to cut our gross domestic product by $1 trillion by 2050. They have voted to reduce our gross national income by $5,000 a person by 2050. They have voted to cut wages by six per cent by 2050. That is what they have voted for. Let us be absolutely crystal clear. The electricity bill is $200 a year higher, thanks to that Bill over there. That is what they voted for.

  I appreciate this question because it allows me to update the parliament and place on the record what has actually happened in relation to the New South Wales bushfires and certainly to correct some of the misleading statements that have been made by the opposition on this.                 Can I firstly say, in relation to the New South Wales bushfires, that, in line with very longstanding arrangements with New South Wales, the Commonwealth has jointly funded relief for people who are in need of it as a result of this serious natural disaster. That means that, through these longstanding arrangements, we make sure that people in need of short-term accommodation, people in need of emergency food, people in need of clothing and people even in need of things such as cash grants can have them available through the services that the New South Wales government runs in the wake of bushfires and which we fund.                 On top of this, we have also announced that we will fund the disaster recovery payment, which is for families who have been severely impacted by these bushfires, which means that they have had lost or damaged homes, or they have had somebody who has been severely injured or have lost a loved one. That is in line with very longstanding practice of the previous Howard government, and, most importantly, it is in line with longstanding practice of the previous Labor government. The Labor Party are running around saying that we have changed the guidelines, even though on many occasions when they were in government they activated the disaster recovery payment in exactly the same way that I have done in relation to the bushfires.                 Let me just run through the circumstances in which this happened. In January 2008, with storms and flooding in Mackay and on the Whitsunday Islands, the Labor Party activated the disaster recovery payment in exactly the same way as I have just done in relation to the New South Wales bushfires. In February 2008, with flooding in Mackay -                      the Labor government activated the disaster recovery payment in exactly the same way as I have just done. Look at them conferring. Check the facts, and I will keep running through it. You might want to ask the shadow minister there, Jenny Macklin, because she was the minister that activated it in exactly the same way as I just have. In November 2008 it was activated in exactly the same way for storms in Queensland.                     Okay, the deputy leader of -                      Just to reaffirm to the parliament: there has been no change in the guidelines for the funding of the Australian disaster recovery payment.                     We have declared for the New South Wales bushfire in exactly the same way as the shadow minister who just interjected did on five separate occasions - in March 2010 in relation to storms in Victoria; in May 2009 in relation to flooding in Queensland. We will continue -

  They are good people in Wright, and they have a good representative as well. On 7 September the Australian people voted emphatically in favour of our policies to repeal the carbon tax, to repeal the mining tax and to fix up what they knew to be Labor's budget black hole. That is what they voted for. I am afraid the opposition have not come to terms with that. I understand that, but the fact is that they are voting against everything we are trying to do to fix up the mess that they have left for the Australian people.                 They have terminated the carbon tax termination. It was their term to say the carbon tax was terminated. Now they have terminated the termination. And now they are in favour of the carbon tax, which is a hit on Australian business, which is a hit on Australian families and which is a detractor from economic growth, and the Labor Party want people to lose jobs, which is part and parcel of the carbon tax. So the Labor Party now are going down the path of punishing the Australian people for opposing the carbon tax.                 And the mining tax - a net cost to the budget of $13½ billion - is a flawed tax that has cost jobs, that has created sovereign risk and that has had a negative impact on Australian government debt. The Labor Party now say they want to keep the mining tax and all of its associated expenditure. Again, the Labor Party are failing to recognise the decision of the Australian people.                 When it comes to dealing with the budget deficit: I wish the first question in question time had been addressed to me from the Leader of the Opposition. Don't leave me out of it, Bill! Ask me a few questions about the cuts, because they are the Labor Party's cuts! What chutzpah, to come in here and complain about cuts that the Labor Party started just a few weeks ago when they were in government! What chutzpah that they should do that - complete hypocrisy from the Labor Party, but no surprise. Their hypocrisy knows no bounds. And why? Because 7 September never happened, in their own minds. There was never a change of government. They rotate through the leaders but it is still the good old Labor Party on the Treasury benches. It is just temporary that they are sitting over there.                 Well, here is a newsflash, and the flash is this: the Australian people made an emphatic decision on 7 September to get rid of a bad government. They voted to get rid of the carbon tax, they voted to get rid of the mining tax and they voted for responsible budgeting. I say to the Labor Party: enough is enough. You did so much damage in government; do not continue the trend in opposition.

  The Labor Party announced a large number of road-funding projects to be funded by the proceeds of the mining tax. These two roads were amongst those projects that Labor said it was going to fund from the proceeds of the mining tax. There are few, if any, proceeds from the mining tax, so Labor was making empty promises. They were promising to fund roads for which they never had the financial resources. That was a dishonest election promise.                 The coalition is reviewing the election promises of the Labor Party - the ones that they had not funded. We know that there are some very worthwhile projects that were on that list and we would like to find a way for them to proceed. So as we look at the resources that are available for road funding, those projects will be under consideration. We will not reject them just because Labor dishonestly promised them when they did not have the financial resources. We will deal with and fund worthwhile road projects across the nation in a bigger road program that Labor has ever dreamed of.                 Leave not granted.                 Leave not granted.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. With a seat that includes Ballina and Yamba, he has a very keen understanding of the importance of the fishing industry.                 It is also important because one of the inflictions on that industry has come about by the Labor Party, in their desire to single-handedly cool the planet with a tax. We all know that if Labor taxes cooled the planet the place would be an icebox, but it is quite clear that the Labor Party had decided that they would inflict this on fishermen.                     Madam Speaker, do you know that when fishermen come to port to buy refrigerant gases - refrigerant gases such as 507A refrigerant gas - that the cost of this gas has gone up by up to $100 a kilogram?                     What this means is that this is a $10,000 hit to the budget for coming home to port. Kevin Hogan, the member for Page, understands this all too well. Not only that, he understands that once they get home and once they get the produce - Australian fish to be fed to Australian people - that they are using Australian power to try and make sure that they keep the fish cold, and that is also taxed by the Australian Labor Party. They believe that there is something evil about the coal that keeps Australian families warm and Australian fish cold.                 But they have a way to make the power that keeps fish cold righteous. What you do is get the coal, and if it passes over water and goes to another country to look after -                      the power that comes from that other country then becomes righteous. But if you look after the power requirements in our nation, well, it is very evil.                 And they had the opportunity today - the government-change deniers on the other side - to work for the working man and woman to reduce the cost of living, but they chose not to. They chose not to, because they are still being run by the Australian Greens. They are still being run by the Australian Greens, and we know that it is a coalition - it is a Labor-Green coalition, and it is -                      We've got their attention! We've got their attention!                     Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I like the fact that in this chamber I seem to excite Labor and the Greens like I did in the other chamber. It is great to see that we have got one side standing up for the working families and the other standing up for the Australian Greens, standing up for their mates in the corner there, making sure we keep people poorer. That is your goal: keep people poorer. I look forward to them explaining to their electorates why it is evil to turn on a light in Bankstown, why it is evil to keep the fish cold, why it is evil to look after the Australian working families' requirements.

  I answered this question last week and I am happy to answer it again. During the election campaign the coalition made a number of very important promises to help regional communities and urban communities deliver services and facilities to benefit their people. The Labor Party also made a list of promises, which they said that they would implement if they were elected to government. But what they do not seem to realise as government change deniers is that the election was won by the coalition. We will honour our election promises, which will deliver substantial benefits to local communities.

  I do thank the member for Kennedy for his question and I appreciate his concerns, concerns which are quite general in this House, to ensure that the foreign investment Australia gets is the right foreign investment that supports our national interest, not the wrong foreign investment that does not. This government, this parliament, this nation has long supported foreign investment. Foreign investment has been a very important part of building the strong economy that we enjoy in this country.                 Our agricultural industry, our mining industry, our manufacturing industry would not be what it is but for foreign investment. So we do very much support foreign investment, but it does have to be the right foreign investment, foreign investment that clearly is in our national interest, not the wrong foreign investment. We have a strong and a good process to determine which is which. We have the Foreign Investment Review Board, which makes recommendations, and we have the Treasurer, who makes decisions on this matter. I am confident that this process is being amply pursued in the case in question and I am confident that it will give our country the best possible result.

  Thank you to the member for Corangamite. We are concerned about electricity bills of all types. We are concerned about big electricity bills, we are concerned about nasty electricity bills and, above all else, we are concerned about puffed up, overinflated electricity bills that have risen beyond their natural level.                     Electricity bills can strike anyone at any time. They can strike any Tom, Dick, Harry, Kevin or Julia. You can be alone in your office and a nasty electricity bill walks through the door and ruins your whole day!                     So we are taking steps to deflate electricity bills. The member for Corangamite raises, as a dutiful member, the position of Colac Area Health. The Victorian government has belled the cat on the impact of the carbon tax on electricity bills. It is $60,000 on Colac Area Health. For the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, there is a $360,000 carbon tax impact on electricity bills. The Royal Children's Hospital, according to the Victorian government, has a $729,000 carbon tax impact on their electricity bill. The entire Victorian health system has a $13½ million impact on its electricity bill as a result of the carbon tax and a $132 million impact between now and 2020.                     Let me just repeat that: a $132 million impact on Victorian health costs as a result of the carbon tax between now and 2020. So we are taking steps, Prime Minister. Only two hours ago, this side of the House voted to repeal the carbon tax and to take away the $60,000 impact, which the member for Corangamite raises with regards to Colac Area Health. Only two hours ago that side of the House, the ALP which promised to terminate the carbon tax, voted to keep it. They voted for a $60,000 tax on Colac Area Health. They voted for the $360,000 tax on the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and the $729,000 tax on the Royal Children's Hospital. We will pass this legislation and we will not stop until it is repealed. They are the only people standing between Australians and lower electricity prices.

  It is a reasonable question to ask. The proposal was a $156 million proposal from the Victorian state government and originally the state government said that they would pay for this project in its entirety. I am advised that the Gillard government then came in, even though the Victorian government had said that they would pay for this project, and in another spree of throwing money around the then Gillard government said that they would fund the $100 million even though the Victorian government had already said that they would spend $156 million. So yes, I want to see this facility built but I want to get value for taxpayers' money so we are continuing discussions with the Victorian government about how best we might add value to the Victorian health services.                  It struck me a little strange that when you looked at the work of the previous government, they were promising money to build facilities already committed to by the Victorian government, yet at the same time they were taking money away from cancer patients. They were promising money to superclinics that never opened and never saw patients. They were spending money on great big new bureaucracies that did not see a single patient, and while all of this waste was going on, more and more pensioners were waiting longer and longer for elective surgery. The former government absolutely stands condemned in terms of their management of health and they have continued, I might say, into opposition.                 Leave not granted.

  Thank you, and welcome to the member for Lyne, a great loss to specialist services in regional Australia but a fabulous addition to this place. Prime Minister, I think I recollect a certain Pollie Pedal where you, I, and the member for Lyne struggled in the freezing rain across the Barrington Tops. The dedication shown on that occasion is the dedication that the member for Lyne brings on behalf of his constituents to this place. Wasting no time, he was in my office this morning banging the table about an early intervention centre for the people of Taree, something that he cares passionately about - Taree being an area of disadvantage in his electorate. One of the great things about new parliaments is that we get to welcome on this side of the House members from rural and regional Australia.                  Once again I get to look at members of the Labor Party who have never risked a dollar of their own money in rural and regional Australia. The problem that we saw written large over childcare policy in the Labor Party was that one size always had to fit everything. There were no regional members to say, 'Things are a little bit different in my small country town, in my mobile childcare centre, in my small occasional childcare centre. In my community preschool with a hardworking volunteer board, things are a bit different.' Oh, no, the dead hand of regulation landed on everyone indiscriminately, and nowhere do we see that more than in rural and regional Australia. We know people in rural and regional Australia generally have less money than people in the city and they have to be careful about their expenses. But they desperately need flexible child care and they need it at a price they can afford.                 But everybody is coming on board with our Productivity Commission inquiry. People are lining up to talk about it. The Kalgoorlie Miner - and another great new regional member, the member for O'Connor, is here - talked about the importance of child care for regional communities, and the mayor said that it cannot be understated that paying too much for child care -                      It is a point on relevance. She should be directly relevant to the question asked. I would have thought she would know how to be directly relevant to a question she wrote.                     Thank you, Madam Speaker. I just want to refer to Kalgoorlie, a city that I went to during the election campaign.                      Madam Speaker, the question was about rural and regional Australia and, by the way, Kalgoorlie is in rural and regional Australia. The mayor of Kalgoorlie says that if you inhibit the ability of parents to obtain child care you inhibit the ability of the city to grow. On this side of the House, we desperately want rural and regional Australia to grow. I look forward to you coming on board with our Productivity Commission inquiry.

  This is a fascinating question. It tells us so much about the modern Labor Party. Yes, it is true that this week the Minister for Social Services introduced legislation to maintain the childcare rebate limit at $7,500 for three financial years starting from 1 July 2014, but it is really important to put this into context. The context, as usual, is Labor's debt - the debt that we on this side of the House have inherited.                 We have heard a lot of numbers. The Treasurer talks about numbers and eloquently expresses them, but I would like to put this information on the table. If we run budget surpluses bigger than the budget surpluses ever run by the Howard government, it would take 20 years to pay off Labor's debt. The interest bill alone is over $10 billion a year. I could build the member for Lyne's early intervention centre with just a portion of that money. Labor has never delivered a budget surplus.                 Let us go back to this budget. I want to talk about the budget the member refers to. Remember the budget that Labor put down in May this year, the one they never expected to implement, the one where they scrambled desperately to plug the leaks coming from their own reckless spending, the one where they tried to create a fig leaf of economic credibility. What they did in that budget was take the $100 million already in savings that we have had to implement this week from that budget, despite not having passed the legislation. So the $100 million that the member asks me about is long gone. This government has to legislate to mop up Labor's mess, a mess created -                      I do not know why the Labor Party do not understand that the $100 million is long gone from the bottom line.                     It is pretty outrageous to expect us with the economic credibility and the responsibility we bring to managing the nation's finances not to implement this measure which Labor has already taken into account. The Labor Party are without courage, without imagination and without competence. We make no apologies for cleaning up their mess.

  I thank the member for Hinkler. I was kind of hoping that I would be asked this question by the Labor Party and in particular by the member for McMahon because just before question time a letter from the member for McMahon was sent to my office. I read the letter - it is a very interesting letter - and it says:                 The Opposition also remains ready to vote for an increase in the debt limit to $500 Billion, if such an increase is supported by revised net debt figures in the Mid-Year Economic Forecast _                 Hang on, 'net debt figures'? He could not have got 'net debt' and 'gross debt' wrong, could he? Hang on, this is the shadow Treasurer. I know Labor do not understand the difference between deficit and surplus and I know they do not know the difference between Rudd and Gillard, but I thought they would understand the difference between 'net' and 'gross'. I read on and it said:                 I note that in Senate Estimates, Senator Wong asked Dr Parkinson to provide an updated iteration of Table 8 of PEFO, showing projected net debt.                 I thought I would go to table 8 of PEFO to see what that is and, hang on, it is gross debt. It is gross debt. How did that happen? Then I thought, hang on, gross debt peaking at $370 billion? But I still gave him the benefit of the doubt because surely the shadow Treasurer would know the difference between net debt and gross debt, given that this is such a significant issue for the Australian parliament. I read on, and it gets better. It states:                 The latest figure in the forward estimates for net debt is $370 billion _                 I hope it is not, because the latest estimate of net debt is $217 billion. No wonder they are concerned. I am going to help the member for McMahon because the last sentence of his letter says:                 Given the importance of this as a national issue and debate and in the interests of openness and transparency, I will be publicly releasing this letter.                 I am sure he will not, so I am going to help him now. If the former Treasurer of Australia does not understand the difference between net debt and gross debt, no wonder the Labor Party just do not get it. They were incompetent in government and they are incompetent in opposition.

  The Abbott government is not ignoring the people of McEwen; it is giving them a carbon tax free future. It is giving their industry a chance to be competitive with industry in the rest of the world. We are providing services and facilities, through our roads and infrastructure program, that Labor had never committed to. The people of Australia looked at the program that Labor offered to them during the election campaign, they looked at the program that the coalition offered to them during the election campaign, and they chose the program put forward by the coalition. The people have had their say and we are now getting on with the process of delivering the promises that we made to the Australian people, and that will be our task over the next three years.

  I thank the honourable member for Higgins for her question, and I can tell her that my response was one of disbelief. I could not believe that the government had conducted a review into the so-called digital revolution. You would remember, Madam Speaker, that the previous government had to have these grandiose names for all of their programs - a la North Korea of the last few decades - and this one was called the Digital Education Revolution.                     It was to be a $1 billion program to deliver one million laptops in schools. The laptops of the 21st century it was called as well.                 Of course after five years the program had blown out to $2.4 billion and they delivered 600,000 laptops in schools.                     They conveniently claimed another 300,000 that had already been in schools before the program even began. They conducted one review - this ranks with the BER, the pink batts program, the cash for clunkers - more Labor messes - and yesterday in estimates the department answered a question about the evaluation with: 'The evaluation was taken under a set of KPIs, which were agreed with stakeholders. It was measured against things like the number of a resource made available, the amount of usage in the classroom and those sorts of things, but no direct line of sight measure against student outcomes'. So the Labor Party spent $2.4 billion of taxpayers' money delivering two-thirds of the laptops they claimed would be delivered, and at no point thought it might be a good idea to find out if it made one jot of difference to the outcomes for students, to the results for students.                     The member for Perth - no wonder she is shaking her head; she cannot believe it either!                     She actually cares about students in schools, unlike the rest of the Labor Party.                   The SPEAKER:  The member for Wakefield is warned!                     What this proves is that the Labor Party, as we always suspected, are all foam and no beer - they are all politics and no policy; all spin and no substance - whereas the coalition want to put students first. We actually think the results for students are quite important. We do not think you should spend $2.4 billion to have a laptops in schools program, review it and not bother to find out if worked or not. We are putting students first, whereas all the Labor Party ever do is put politics first.

  When this government came to office, it was faced with a stark reality of the situation left by the previous Labor government. Let me put this in stark contrast. In 2007, when the Labor Party came to government, the nation had a net balance of $45 billion - in other words, the nation was in the black. But what happened over six years of Labor government? That $2,100 in the bank that every man, woman and child in Australia had in 2007, what had happened to that by 2013? The reality is, as the Treasurer pointed out earlier, we have something like $217 million of net debt. So instead of every man, woman and child in Australia having the equivalent of $2,100 in the bank, what were they left with after Labor in government? They were left with $12,900 in the red for every man, woman and child in Australia.                     In answer to the question: against the background of a Labor Party that was so irresponsible with the finances of this country that it has left us so far in the red, then where expenditure has not been made, where contracts have not been fulfilled, where simply election promises have been made such as what the honourable member is talking about, we will -                      Against the background of a Labor Party that trashed the finances of Australia, that ran up a huge debt for the people of Australia, where matters had not been contracted, where funds have just been promised in the context of the election campaign, we will do the prudent thing and the prudent thing is to review all of those matters.

  I thank the honourable member for his question and I can well understand the frustration and disappointment of his constituents. There was a $31-billion black hole advised to the Labor government at the end of 2010 and, regrettably, quite a few truths have vanished into it.                  One of them was the true state of the broadband rollout by the NBN. In fact, as the honourable member said, in October 2011 the then government announced that construction had commenced in East Victoria Park and Burswood. Two years later there is no ready-for-service premises in those areas. Indeed, despite barrels of propaganda, reams of leaflets and flyers, and lots of claims, on election day in total there were 34 brownfield premises in Perth connected to the fibre network, and across the whole state of Western Australia there were 75 brownfield premises connected. NBN connections in Western Australia have been as rare as sightings of Brian Burke.                 In the Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia, right now, as of today, there are 1,395 premises connected to the NBN brownfields fibre network - this is in the built-up, established areas - of which more than half were in the Willunga trial site that had been built in 2011. So over the last two years practically nothing has happened.                 The honourable member asked me how can we make this more affordable and cost-effective, and the answer is to use a mix of technologies. How many times have honourable members heard me talk about the virtues of different technologies - fibre to the node, VDSL and so forth. The frustrating thing, as we all know, is that we make these powerful cases as advocates and we never change the minds of those opposite. But, Madam Speaker, sometimes you do. I was so gratified to receive a warm letter from the member for Adelaide on 27 September congratulating me on my appointment as minister and concluding:                 Adelaide needs and deserves access to fibre-to-the-node (FTTN) broadband infrastructure, and I have pledged to do all that I can to ensure that they get it. I ask that you please use your appointment as the responsible minister to do the same.                 On this point I will accede to the member for Adelaide's wishes: we will deliver a more cost-effective network. I table the honourable member's letter.

  I indicate to the honourable member who asked the question - and indeed all honourable members of the chamber - that where contracts have not been executed, in the light of the Bowen black hole that we inherited, we will do what a prudent and sensible government would do and that is that we will review all of those matters. I repeat to her that, because matters have been promised in the context of an election campaign by the Labor Party, that does not mean that we have to honour those agreements. But in a situation where we have a $200 billion net debt, where we have a Labor Party that could not deliver a surplus for the whole of its six years in government - and, ask about as many of these grants as you like, the answer will be in exactly the same - we will act prudently and that means that we will review all of those matters.

  Call me old fashioned but I thought the Minister for Health was responsible for helping sick people, for making sure that when patients turned up to emergency departments we could provide them with the services that they need, maybe even provide elective surgery for pensioners who are waiting for a hip replacement or a knee replacement, but no. That was not the approach of the previous minister.                     Again, the previous minister is a little touchy because she knows what is coming. Not only did the previous government take money away from chemotherapy services, not only did they promise superclinics that never saw patients, not only did they take money away from desperate patients but now we find out that they were providing money for burnout competitions here in Canberra. It is a great capital but should we be spending money on burnout competitions instead of providing services for patients across the whole country?                 I will tell you what: under this government we will not tolerate this sort of waste and mismanagement. The former government left us with $370 billion of debt. I promise the Australian people that once we have cleaned up Labor's mess we will make sure that more patients get elective surgery. I will make sure that it is easier for patients to see their doctors. I want to make sure that, instead of spending money on this nonsense that Labor subscribed to to keep their union mates happy, we will spend it on patients instead. They grew the bureaucracy. They had 18 outside agencies in addition to the department and they were spending money on Facebook competitions and this sort of activity, which will not be tolerated under this government.                 I will make sure that the health of this nation is put ahead of these sorts of ridiculous proposals and funding agreements that Labor entered into and I will deliver, as this government will, for the Australian patients.

  I must say the GP superclinic was one of my favourite Labor programs - $650 million of taxpayers' money; first promised in 2007. Here we are in 2013 and there are still some that are in a planning stage, six years later. Can somebody explain to me how Labor presided over such incompetence in government? How did we spend money? How did our country get to a point where in the Health portfolio we are spending money on burnout competitions but not on patients? If anybody had any doubt about the incompetence of the Labor Party look no further than the former Minister for Health and Ageing.                  Look at what Labor did in the portfolio. The member for Longman is a great local member. He has championed the cause of patients in his electorate over the course of the last five or six years. He wants to make sure that patients can get in to see a doctor. It is not a big ask. Do you know, Madam Speaker, that this clinic was first promised by the former government on 12 August 2010, indeed, during the 2010 election campaign. Here we are, three years later - people turning up to this vacant paddock expecting some sort of clinical services to be delivered, but it is not going to reach the standard. Doctors are not going to be able to practise in a vacant paddock because the planning stages are still underway. This is a government that will get on and provide services to patients. Contrast that to Labor's time in health when they promised so much and wasted so much, but they delivered so little.                 I want to make sure that this does not continue, but I am worried about another site. At the last election the good people of Redcliffe, and right across that seat, delivered a great member to Petrie. They were sick of the promises that the former member made in relation to the superclinic - so called - on the Redcliffe Peninsular. It is also an interesting study. It started out as a $5 million promise. This was when the government of the day promised to give $5 million to a medical entrepreneur to set up one of these superclinics to compete with doctors who had already put their own capital at risk to deliver services. This program was completely devoid of any logic but, give it some time, and does it get better? No. Five million dollars were promised initially and then the cost blew out to $13.2 million.                 Let us try to average this across the number of patients who have been seen in the service, which would be okay if, let us say, a million patients had been seen since that time. The problem with the GP superclinic in Redcliffe is that after $13.2 million and six years, it has not seen a patient. Not one! I said to my office: how can we calculate $13.2 million over zero patients? Of course we cannot because this is a testament to the incompetence of the previous Labor government. We will fix up Labor's mess and we will get the health system in this country back on track.

I know that surprises members opposite because they never stand by any of theirs. I know they have made repeated pre-election claims only to dishonour them post election. But I want to put their minds at ease: we stand by all our pre-election commitments and we will deliver on all our pre-election commitments.

  Let me thank the honourable member for Brisbane, a former Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence in a former outstanding coalition government and someone who actually stands up for her defence community.                   The member for Wakefield then left the chamber.                     Labor has hit a trifecta. Last week, we heard the defence secretary publicly confirming the truth that we on this side have known for so long - that your $25 billion of cuts have actually impacted significantly. Yesterday, we learnt the former Minister for Defence, Stephen Smith, was reported as saying that defence reforms could not be fulfilled because of the axe Labor took to defence. Today, a leading defence industry body, the Defence Teaming Centre, said that the former Minister for Defence, Stephen Smith, following the pre-election of Kevin Rudd, transitioned from disinterested to disengaged. It sounds a bit like former Minister Conroy in the previous government. He was so disengaged he only connected 75 premises in all of Western Australia. The Defence Teaming Centre went on further to say that following the announcement of the election by former Prime Minister Gillard, a decision paralysis fell upon the government and the flow of work almost ceased. The white paper came out with a promise of a defence capability plan and a defence industry policy statement but neither of those were delivered. That is the way industry viewed the former Labor government - dismal and a mess. Six thousand jobs were lost because of their cuts to defence, a massive capability deficit and acquisitions pushed out to the never-never.                 We know there is a better way. This government, under the leadership of the Prime Minister, is taking a funding envelope to defence and that funding envelope says that there will be no cuts to the defence budget, as opposed to the $25 billion the former Labor government took out. There will be no cuts to the defence budget. We will take defence spending as a proportion of GDP back to two per cent. Where is it now? It is 1.56 per cent, the lowest level since 1938, and any savings will be reinvested. We will ensure that the ADF is equipped wherever possible by Australian made goods, consistent with getting good value for taxpayers' money. We will make it clear that Australian businesses will be given every opportunity to compete for work because under this government Australia is back in business. Under this government, defence is back to being funded. Under this government, we will get things done.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. The best guarantee we can give is that we are not like members opposite, who make solemn pledges before an election and break them afterwards. The problem with the Leader of the Opposition is that he is not capable of changing his question time strategy quickly.                 I want to make it absolutely crystal clear that this government is cleaning up Labor's mess, the mess that the Leader of the Opposition left by cutting $1.2 billion from school funding in the pre-election fiscal outlook statement. So we are cleaning up Labor's mess and we are keeping our commitments.                     Schools will get $2.8 billion more under this government over the four-year period. That is $1.2 billion more than they were left with under this shambolic former education minister.

  I thank the member for Bonner for his question. I want to assure him and all members that this government is cleaning up the mess we inherited and we are keeping our commitments. Wherever members look there are problems that were given to us by the former government, whether it is the gross debt skyrocketing past $400 billion; the deficits stretching out beyond where the eye can see, because of the fiscal profligacy of the former government;  -                      whether it is the $25 billion ripped out of defence, leaving us with the lowest level of defence spending as a percentage of GDP since 1938; whether it is the $1.2 billion ripped out of schools by the Leader of the Opposition; whether it is the almost $100 billion that was being misspent on the National Broadband Network white elephant; whether it be the complete failure to put any funding in for border protection after 1 January; the failure to provide for chemotherapy infusions after 1 January; or whether it is the fact that the ACCC has been running at a loss for three years.                     Everywhere you look the former government has left a mess. If it were so fantastic, why did they politically execute two prime ministers. If they are so proud of themselves, why were the Sussex Street death squads deployed, not once but twice, to assassinate their own leaders, led, of course, by the current Leader of the Opposition. I say this: if former Prime Ministers Rudd and Gillard could not trust this opposition leader, the Australian people certainly cannot. We are keeping our commitments.                     The most fundamental commitment of all we will deliver is to repeal the carbon tax. Repealing the carbon tax will leave every Australian household $550 a year better off. What has the Leader of the Opposition got against a $550 Christmas present for every Australian household. Every time Australians get an electricity bill they know that it is $200 higher than it should be, because of that smug Bill over there.

  He obviously had what he thought was a fantastic question-time strategy and he is incapable of adjusting it in the light of the facts as they stand.                     The only people who have cut funding from education in this House are the members opposite. In last year's MYEFO -                      In last year's MYEFO they cut $3.8 billion out of education and in this year's PEFO -                      Members opposite cut $3.8 billion out of education in last year's MYEFO; they cut $1.6 billion out of public hospitals in last year's MYEFO and in the PEFO that we got before the election, no one -                      The Leader of the Opposition himself signed off on a $1.2 billion cut in school funding.                     I hear members opposite bellowing and carrying on. We had the shadow Treasurer and we had the member for Adelaide admit in the media, over the last couple of days, that that is exactly what the Leader of the Opposition did. He ripped $1.2 billion off the vulnerable school students and schools of Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory. We are putting it back. We are not just keeping our commitments, we are more than keeping our commitments.

  I thank the member for Mitchell for his question, asking this on behalf of his electorate and the Filipino community in his electorate. The destruction and devastation caused by Typhoon Haiyan on 8 and 9 November in the Philippines has been immense. About 13 million people are estimated to be affected. About four million people are estimated to be displaced from their homes. The death toll is not final but we know that there have been deaths in the thousands, including two Australians. The Australian government responded rapidly in coordination with NGOs and the Philippine government. In particular, we had emergency stores on the ground within hours of the typhoon. We were able to deploy a medical team within days and funding was provided virtually immediately to the Red Cross, other NGOs and to the United Nations. In total, our assistance comes to some $30 million.                  On the ground, Australians are having a significant impact and our medical team set up a 50-bed facility at Tacloban Airport, and in the first 24 hours of arriving they treated 100 patients. The ADF is there and have evacuated about 3½-thousand people - nearly 3,400. They have transported 400 relief workers into the disaster-affected areas. HMAS Tobruk has also arrived, to the great relief of the Philippines' people, as I am informed by their foreign minister, and onboard HMAS Tobruk are 100 personnel who are engaged in repair and reconstruction and recovery work - particularly of schools, as requested by the Filipino government. The Australian public are said to have contributed $9 million, which indicates the generosity of the Australian people, and Australia overall is the fourth-largest donor to the Philippines tragedy after the UK, the US and Japan. We, of course, stand ready to assist whenever we are required. I spoke to foreign minister Del Rosario. He thanked us for our assistance. I will be travelling to the Philippines shortly, to discuss further aid and assistance with the Filipino government.                  I want to thank our Ambassador to the Philippines, Bill Tweddell, and the team in Manila, also our consular, humanitarian and crisis-centre team at DFAT. I went down to see them last Thursday and thanked them for the work that they have done. I thank the opposition and the Leader of the Opposition for the bipartisan support in relation to this matter. The Australian government stands ready, as I said, to support the Philippines in however they wish us to support their reconstruction effort. It has been a devastating time for them, but Australia stands with its dear friend the Philippines.

  Our guarantee is that we will spend $1.2 billion more over the forward estimates than was envisaged by the Leader of the Opposition. I am sure members opposite will be interested in the statement of the Premier of New South Wales on this matter. He said, 'Mr Abbott should be commended for restoring $1.2 billion of education funding which was deceitfully removed by the Labor government in its dying days.' He went on: 'Tony Abbott's handling of this issue is a refreshing change to the way Labor engaged with the states.'

  I thank the member for Higgins for that question. For the first time, we have received phone calls now from international investors and rating agencies concerned about Australia possibly reaching -                      The rating agencies have for the first time contacted us concerned about possibly reaching the debt limit in the next few days. It was the Labor Party - the member for McMahon - that introduced the debt limit of $75 billion, pledging it would never be reached. Then Labor introduced a debt limit of $200 billion, saying it would never be reached. Then they introduced a debt limit of $250 billion, saying it would never be reached. Then they introduced a debt limit of $300 billion, and Labor said it would never be reached. Yet they budgeted a debt limit of $370 billion peak debt and, at the same time, the member for Lilley laid on the table of this parliament advice to say that there has to be an additional $60 billion buffer. So I would say to the members opposite: this is the debt that Labor created. Labor is offering a partial solution of a debt limit of $400 billion when they left us with a debt -                      that is well going to exceed, as the Secretary of the Treasury advised the Senate, over $400 billion.                 The fact of the matter is this. I know the Leader of the Opposition has a shadow Treasurer who does not understand the difference between net debt and gross debt, but I would say to the Leader of the Opposition -                      Come on.                     I would say to the Leader of the Opposition -                      I say to the Leader of the Opposition and I say to the Greens as well: this is unprecedented territory. If the Labor Party is going to prevent us from trying to fix the problems they created then they will wear this. It will be their responsibility. Labor created the debt of over $400 billion, and now at a cost to the nation they are preventing us from dealing with it. This is a test for the Leader of the Opposition.

  New to the question and, I suspect, outside the standing orders. As I have made absolutely crystal clear, the $1.2 billion that the Leader of the Opposition ripped out of school funding just prior to the election is being fully restored by the coalition, because the difference between us and members opposite is that under us there is a system which is national and fair - national, fair and that we will fully fund to the tune of $2.8 billion. That commitment we will fully fund, unlike the Leader of the Opposition.

  I wish to make three points in response to the member. First, Australia will act to protect our national interest and to protect our citizens. We always have under governments of both persuasions; and, as far as I am concerned, we always will. We will act to protect our national security, and we will act to protect our national security using agencies such as ASIO and ASIS.                 The second point I want to make is that our security agencies operate under very strict safeguards. They operate under the scrutiny and the supervision of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security and under the scrutiny and the supervision of the Inspector General of Intelligence and Security. These are strong and effective safeguards.                 The final point I wish to make is that it has not been the practice of any government of either persuasion to comment on operational matters.

  I am very pleased to be able to inform the member for Ryan that, following the press conference that the Prime Minister and I have done today, Queensland will gain $794 million in extra funding for their school students over the next four years. Queensland is one of the three winners from the coalition extending our commitment beyond matching Labor's level of funding before the election. You would remember that Labor took $1.2 billion from the school funding model in the pre-election fiscal outlook. They ripped it away from Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. I am very pleased to be able to say today that Queensland will gain almost $800 million for their school students because this government are not only keeping their commitment to match Labor's funding but are going beyond that commitment with $1.2 billion of new money. We were left a complete mess -                      by the previous government. The previous minister for education, in the short tenure the Leader of the Opposition had in that role, ripped $1.2 billion out of school funding and he left a national model that did not include three of the most important jurisdictions in Australia. So there was no national model. He took $1.2 billion from the model. We on the other hand will keep all of our commitments. We are putting $1.6 billion in that Labor promised; we are putting in an extra $1.2 billion that Labor took; we are delivering a national model that includes every jurisdiction; and we will dismantle in the Australian Education Act the red tape and the regulations that Labor built in that made the model almost unintelligible and incapable of being delivered. We will not have a federal inspectorate, we will not have a school performance institute and we will not have all the levels of ministerial intervention from Canberra in our state and territory schools, so that we can say with absolute confidence that, following this commitment, no school can be worse off because of anything that the Commonwealth does.

  We are actually doing better, because the money that the Leader of the Opposition ripped out we are fully putting back, so we are more than keeping our commitments. We will always keep our commitments. In this case, we are doing better than simply keeping our commitments.

  I am delighted to get another question from my own side with respect to the government's announcement today, and I am shocked, surprised, that the opposition has not been able to summon up the courage to ask me a question about school funding. Ataturk said that when the battle changes a good general changes their battle tactics. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition is still using last week's questions pack and asking the same questions he would have asked before the government's announcement before question time, but I guess that will change with experience in opposition.                 I have good news for the member for Swan. In fact, Western Australia will gain remarkably from the announcement that we made before question time. Over the next four years they will gain $120 million more in extra funding that was ripped away by the former minister for education, the Leader of the Opposition, before the election. In the pre-election fiscal outlook, the former minister for education, now the Leader of the Opposition, took $120 million from Western Australia - punished them for the good outcomes that they are achieving - because Labor do not like the independent public schools model in Western Australia. They ripped that money away and the coalition today announced that we are putting that money back. We want the debate to move from this debate about school funding to something that really matters in education beyond school funding, and that is quality and standards - teacher quality, parental engagement, a robust curriculum and more local decision making -                      And, yes, phonics. The member for Ballarat raises phonics. Yes - the coalition is deeply committed to orthodox teaching methods and phonics, because we want students to leave school being able to read and write. The member for Perth, very respectfully, has written on this subject and said exactly what I am saying today - that things like phonics are exactly the way to improve the literacy and numeracy of our students. She said it. She said modern fads are teaching our students to hate school, and I agree with the member for Perth about that and I am glad to have her on our team.                 Western Australia will win from the decisions that we have made today. We are putting back the money that Labor ripped from schools in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, and the Western Australians will be able to get on with that excellent work they are doing in giving more autonomy and local decision-making to independent public schools, which is transforming public schooling, not just in the schools but in the communities in which those schools reside.

  I am delighted to get another question, this time from the Northern Territory, about the government's education announcements today.                      I am very surprised that the Labor Party has chosen to ignore the Minister for Education on such an important day for schools. I can tell the member for Solomon that the Northern Territory will gain $272 million from today's announcement.                     That is $272 million that will, from 2014, flow to Northern Territory schools - schools that have their own particular challenges in supporting those students that the Giles government -                      is trying to help. It is $272 million for the Northern Territory that the former Minister for Education, now the Leader of the Opposition, ripped away in the pre-election fiscal outlook. This government is not only keeping the commitments it made before the election to have the same funding level as Labor of $1.6 billion; we have gone further. We are putting an extra $1.2 billion into school education. I can understand the embarrassment of the Labor Party - because they think education is their issue. It must really stick in their craw that it is the coalition government that is spending more money in school education over the next four years than Labor would have had they been re-elected. If Labor had been re-elected, schools would be $1.2 billion short on the funding they expected over the next four years. If Labor had been re-elected, there would be no national school funding agreement. But I have delivered a national school funding agreement. I have delivered what the Leader of the Opposition was incapable of doing. I have delivered an agreement that includes every jurisdiction - state and territory, Catholic and independent -                      and I have delivered it with $1.2 billion more money, which means we can move on to debates about teacher quality, about curriculum, about engaging parents and about more local decision making. It is no surprise that the Premier of New South Wales said today:                 This measure alone -                  our announcement of $1.2 billion -                  means schools students are in a better position now than they were before the election.                 He said - and it is worth repeating:                 Mr Abbott should be commended for restoring the $1.2 billion of education funding which was deceitfully removed by the Labor government in its dying days.                 Deceitfully removed by whom? - by the former Minister for Education, the now Leader of the Opposition, who has remained very silent about his $1.2 billion cut. Unfortunately for him, it is now writ large for all to see.

  What we see again is more shameless effrontery from members opposite. Let us be clear about what they are doing. Members opposite are complaining because we are putting back in the money they ripped out. They are unhappy about that. The truth is that the people of Australia can trust us in a way they could never trust old 'Billion Dollar Bill' over there - $1.2 billion ripped out of school funding.                     To assist the House, I am happy to withdraw. In fact -                      Madam Speaker, of course I should not have used that phrase to describe the Leader of the Opposition, because it was $1.2 billion, not just $1 billion, that he ripped out of school funding. We will change the Australian Education Act passed by the former government to end the Canberra command and control system that was put in place by members opposite.                     This government will run a consultative and collegial system. We will end the blame game and we will work cooperatively with the states, and I believe that the states will honour their commitments to spend more money on schools.

  I did notice the comments from the chairman of Rusal Australia, and members of the opposition should have noticed the comments from the chairman of Rusal Australia. For the record, Rusal is a part owner of the QAL alumina refinery in Gladstone - 1,000 employees and another 300 contractors. This is what the chairman said in The Australian Financial Review last week:                 Rusal Australia made it clear over the past three years in meetings with, and briefings to, the previous government that its investment in the _ (QAL) refinery at Gladstone was being put at risk by the government's unilateral carbon tax and energy policy.                     The chairman went on to say:                 We will not invest another cent in major capital improvements until Labor agrees to the repeal of the carbon tax _                 That is a major investor noting that they would not make another cent of investment until the carbon tax was repealed. That warning has been given in crystal clear fashion over the last three years. Significantly, the member for Isaacs asks about the environment. That is interesting, because during the course of this article the chairman of Rusal goes on to say:                 A tonne of alumina produced in Australia emits on average 0.85 tonnes of CO2, while in China the average carbon emission from production of a tonne of alumina is 1.35 tonnes.                 In other words, the policy of those opposite costs Australian jobs and costs Australian investments, but it also sends up global emissions. For a policy designed to help the environment, it does damage on jobs, it does damage to investment and it does damage to the environment. But it is more than just the member's own area of Flynn and Gladstone. The Queensland Treasurer recently said:                 By the modelling done for the previous State government, Queensland could lose up to 21,000 jobs by 2020 and Gross State Product could fall by $9.6 billion thanks to the carbon tax.                  Gladstone - pain; Queensland - pain. As the Minerals Council in its submission recently told the Senate:                 _ for the mining sector the combined costs of permits, higher fuel costs and pass through of carbon costs on gas and electricity was an added burden of about $1.2 billion.                  So let us be clear - this tax does damage to jobs, damage to investment and it sends emissions up and overseas.

  This government will never honour the promises of people smugglers, because what people smugglers promise is permanent residence in Australia. It does not matter whether that promise was made three years ago or three days ago, this government will never honour the promise of a people smuggler. That is why this government has honoured its commitment to restore temporary protection visas. It moved swiftly to do that, and on 18 October they came back into being. That happened because more than five years ago the previous government abolished temporary protection visas, and we know what happened after August 2008 when they abolished temporary protection visas. We know that more than 50,000 people turned up illegally on boats.                 We also know - and I draw this particularly to the attention of the Leader of the Opposition, who has had a bit to say today about the impact of temporary protection visas on children getting on boats - that, when more than 50,000 people turned up illegally on boats, that included more than 8,000 children. More than 8,000 children arrived after they abolished temporary protection visas, because when you say you are going to honour the promise of a people smuggler what happens is that people come, and they come, and they come, as they did in their hundreds and their thousands and their tens of thousands, with over 800 boats arriving under the previous government. So we have taken action to restore temporary protection visas. The opposition might like to know that since we have done that, 181 people who were sitting in the community on bridging visas waiting around for a permanent protection visa from the previous government have decided to go home. They have decided to leave because there is no point hanging around for a temporary protection visa, because they will not get what the people smugglers promised them. This afternoon the opposition will be tested, because in the Senate they will have to vote on whether they are going to join the Greens yet again to disallow the introduction of temporary protection visas.                   The member for Rankin then left the chamber.                     What we have to understand is: will they make the same mistake again? It is the same mistake that led to more than 1,100 deaths. Are they going to join with the Greens? Or should they take the advice of former Senator Carr, whose one piece of advice to the ALP was for there to be no daylight between Tony Abbott and Labor on irregular immigration. Maybe they thought Senator Carr was referring to Christine Milne or the real shadow minister for immigration, Senator Hanson-Young, because this afternoon the Greens and the Labor Party will come together to repeat history and to try and deny this government its election mandate for temporary protection visas to be back in business.

  These questions were no good yesterday, and they are even worse today. We were on a unity ticket with the Labor Party when the Labor Party was promising $2.8 billion over the forward estimates. What happened was that just a few weeks before election day the member opposite ripped $1.2 billion out. They ripped $1.2 billion out and now they are complaining because we are putting back the money they ripped out.                     So, members opposite broke the unity ticket. They broke the unity ticket. They abandoned the dream team when they deceitfully and disingenuously ripped $1.2 billion out of school funding.

  I thank the member for his question and his interest in this issue. In August 2008 the former government made the worst decision that it made in government in abolishing temporary protection visas. And last night Labor and the Greens did it again. The definition of stupidity is doing the same thing twice and expecting a different result, and those opposite might wish to take that counsel.                  The previous government, when they abolished temporary protection visas, gave the people smugglers a product to sell, and that product was permanent residence in Australia. Last night in the Senate they teamed up with the real opposition - the Greens, the ones who are directing the opposition in the Greens - and they decided that they were going to seal the deal, that they wanted to honour the deal that people smugglers had made. People smugglers had made promises to the 33,000 people who are here - the 33,000 people who arrived under their watch - and they wanted to seal the deal with a promise of permanent residency.                  The result of that decision, as the member has asked about, was chaos, cost and tragedy. Over 50,000 people arrived - more than 8,300 children - after they abolished temporary protection visas, at a cost blow-out of $11.6 billion. The results were catastrophic. The lesson is that you have to stand for what you believe in when it comes to border protection, and no self-respecting government would ever honour the promise of a people smuggler, but that is what the opposition did last night in the Senate with the Greens.                     Thank you, Madam Speaker. I know the Manager of Opposition Business is very sensitive on this point as he has the worst record of any former immigration minister on illegal arrivals to Australia by boat. That is quite an achievement, because all the worst immigration ministers are still sitting on that side of the House. I will give them some advice in terms of the lessons - and it does not come from me; the advice comes from none other than former Senator Bob Carr, who said this: 'Not a bit of daylight should there be between the ALP and Tony Abbott on irregular migration.'                  I have some advice for those opposite. This is the Prime Minister, Tony Abbott. This is what he looks like. This is the one you should be following because he has the strongest border protection measures that this country has ever seen. This is the Leader of the Greens. This is not the person you should be following.                      This is the Prime Minister you should be following. The opposition should note that. Last night the Greens and Labor teamed up to repeat their failed history once again, but the government will not bow to people smugglers. We will not honour their promise.

  I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that I am responsible for what the Commonwealth does; the states are responsible for what the states do.                     I will also remind -                      I will also remind the Leader of the Opposition that the only state government that has ripped money out of school funding is the South Australian Labor state government, which has ripped $200 million out of school funding under the agreement that the Leader of the Opposition negotiated.                     The Leader of the Opposition just cannot help himself. He is constantly interjecting across the table. He should look at the Adelaide ABC interview from this morning, where the South Australian Labor education minister admitted that she is ripping $200 million out of school funding. I table the transcript of the ABC interview.                  What we are doing is honouring our commitments to the Australian people at the election. I can understand why members opposite are so upset.                      You could not trust Labor, but you can trust this coalition.

  I do thank the member for Denison for his question. It was good of the member for Denison, given the passion and the sincerity that he brings to this issue, to rephrase it in ways which are a little less aggressive towards members opposite.                 The member for Denison knows what it is like to deal with people on this side of the parliament and he knows what it is like to deal with people on the other side of the parliament. The thing that you can be confident of with us is that we will keep our commitments, unlike members opposite, who broke their commitment to the member for Denison. We will exactly keep the commitment that we made before the election when it comes to gambling. Firstly, we support voluntary precommitment. Secondly, we support more counselling for problem gamblers. Thirdly, we will implement stronger restrictions on online gambling.

  I thank the member for Durack for her question. I remember being with the now member for Durack in Geraldton. Those opposite will remember Geraldton. That is where the illegal boat turned up, right in Geraldton harbour. They will remember that place very well, as I know everyone in Geraldton will remember that day. They took me to where they saw the boat and then they saw the rubber dinghy, which was the Border Protection Command under the previous government, go out.                 I have been asked about those 33,000 people. That is the correct number: there are 33,000 people in Australia today in immigration detention, on bridging visas and in community detention. They are 33,000 of the more than 50,000 who turned up under the previous government. Fifteen thousand of them were given permanent visas by the previous government, delivering on the promise of the people smugglers. And the 33,000 others were waiting for that promise to be fulfilled if the previous government were re-elected. They were hoping that the former minister for immigration would be the now minister for immigration, because he promised to give them permanent visas if Labor were re-elected.                 But this government took a different view. This government took the view that it does not matter if you turned up three days ago, three weeks ago, three months ago or three years ago; it is never right to illegally enter Australia and force those claims on this country and demand permanent residence. You either believe that or you do not. The people smugglers always knew that, whatever they did, the other side did not believe it. Those opposite always had to be dragged kicking and screaming.                 To answer the member for Durack's question: to stop the boats and remove that incentive you have to have the right policies and you have to have them in the right hands. Before the last election the previous government had to be dragged kicking and screaming to put offshore processing back in place. They previously said it was not necessary. They previously said it had no role in stopping the boats under the Howard government. But they were forced, as the political winds blew hard against them - not out of conviction but out of political fear - to reintroduce offshore processing.                 At the last election, the people of Australia made a judgment. They said that they did not trust the Labor Party with border protection policies, even if some of those border protection policies were starting to head in the right direction. They wanted to trust people who believed in those policies and would follow through on those policies. What we saw last night was a very clear indication that the Australian people got it right. They knew that the Labor Party, if they got back into office, would revert to form, revert to the Greens, and seek to undermine the border protection laws of this country. That is what they voted for last night. They ignored the mandate of the Australian people. They gave the two-fingered salute to the Australian people and said, 'We'd rather be with the Greens than with the Australian people.'

  I thank the member for O'Connor for his question. Our plan for a stronger economy is also well known. It has come through in some of the more recent data. We had some promising retail sales data come out today, which was above market expectations. Clearly there is hope out there that we are going to have a good Christmas for retail despite the best endeavours of Labor. We also had a pretty good Dun and Bradstreet business expectations survey -                      come out today which indicates that twice as many businesses intend to hire staff in the new year compared to the last few months of this year.                 We had a very clear plan going to the election. We said we wanted to abolish the carbon tax to stimulate economic growth. We wanted to get rid of the mining tax -                      with its associated expenditure to reduce government expenditure by $13 billion and reduce the debt. We said we were going to get rid of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to reduce government debt. We also said that we were going to make the decisions that needed to be made to fix up the budget and start to live within our means.                 Of course, we were left with a legacy from Labor of a $370 billion forecast peak debt, with a $300 billion debt limit. That is the way Labor are. Labor always leave their problems to other people. They are always inconsistent. They say one thing before an election and something else afterwards. There is no better instance of this -                      Hang in there, China, I know you've only got three years to go!                  Senator Kim Carr put out a press release saying that Labor was so committed to the education cuts before the election that they are going to oppose them after the election! Labor is going to oppose their own education cuts, which they took to the last election. You might say that that is pretty absurd, but before the election Labor said they were going to terminate the carbon tax. Now, after the election, they say that they are so going to terminate the carbon tax that they are going to block it! They are going to block the termination of the carbon tax. I thought to myself, 'Hang on, Labor is saying one thing before the election and then voting against it afterwards. Surely, Labor could not be inconsistent?' Then I picked up the new budget paper from the South Australian government. I looked at page 28, which says that the Labor government in South Australia is booking $32 million from the removal of the carbon tax. So Labor says one thing before the election and another thing afterwards. But don't worry, they will bank the money that does not exist.

  I am delighted finally to be asked a question by the opposition on an education issue. It is the first one in this parliament, in fact. I am very happy to answer it. The government announced yesterday that we will put back into school education the $1.2 billion that the previous minister for education, the now Leader of the Opposition, took out. For Queensland that means $794 million more over the next four years that they can spend on schools and on school students. I am very pleased to be able to say that John-Paul Langbroek, the Queensland minister for education, put out a statement yesterday saying that that money would be used for improving principal autonomy, discipline in schools and teacher quality, according entirely with this government's priorities and, most importantly, the priorities of parents and grandparents for their students in schools.                  Parents and grandparents are not interested in the petty political games being played by the opposition on this issue. They are much more interested in results for their students - for their children and grandchildren. They are much more interested in quality and standards, which is what this government is interested in. We say to Queensland: 'We will treat you like an adult government. We're not going to have central command and control of your school systems from Canberra.' There is a very good reason for that. We do not own or operate any schools in Queensland. I know that will come as a shock to the shadow minister for education, who has only a passing interest in education, herself, personally -                      who has had only a rudimentary association with education. This will come as a shock to her - I am going to let her in on a secret - the Commonwealth does not own or operate any schools. I know it is a shock. The states operate schools. They own schools. They employ teachers. This is what the Commonwealth will do: we will do our bit. We will play our part. We will put Commonwealth resources into our priorities, the states' priorities and territories' priorities to get the best results possible. But we will not have the red tape, the regulation, the school performance institute and the management plans by ministers from Canberra - Canberra central command and control. In closing, the Leader of the Opposition agreed with us. Before the election, in his deal with Victoria, he convinced Dennis Napthine to sign up. Dennis Napthine said:                 At the last minute, very late, even as late as Saturday night, we had an agreement, finally, from the federal government that they were prepared to amend the Education Act to confirm the autonomy of Victorian government schools.                 You are hung by your own words.

  I thank the member of Banks, who represents thousands of small businesses and who is right to raise their concerns in this House against the contempt shown by those on the other side for small businesses with legitimate concerns about cost pressures. That which the member for Banks raised has also been raised by the Australian Industry Group. The Australian Industry Group identified from its surveys a 14½ per cent electricity price impact on its members as a consequence of the carbon tax. Let me repeat that: there is a 14½ per cent increase in electricity prices for the Australian Industry Group's manufacturing and small and medium business base. But it is more than just that. It is also about gas prices, which we know will come down by seven per cent, on average, when the carbon tax is removed. It is also about refrigerant costs. In particular, we know that if the Leader of the Opposition is elected as Prime Minister we will see a new trucking tax for carbon.                     The trucking tax is part of their policy. Here is a chance for the Leader of the Opposition or any other member to rule out once and for all what they took to the election. Do they stand by the new trucking tax, which will hurt small businesses and owner-operators, or will they rule it out? We know also when we look at the situation of Clean Brite, which has been affected by higher electricity prices, that it is part of a $4 billion hit on electricity prices around the country, according to the Clean Energy Regulator. Those electricity prices are felt by mums and dads, pensioners, seniors, small-business owners and large-business owners. That is why the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council, the Minerals Council and ACCI have all called for the removal of the carbon tax immediately.                  So the question goes to whether or not there are any obstacles. At the moment in the Senate there is a filibuster going on. What we see is that the friends from the Labor Party are debating the carbon tax bills by dividing them, by splitting them, by amending them, by seeking to have them run well beyond Christmas, so as to take away the removal of the electricity price benefit which would come when these carbon tax bills are gone. Right now, there is an obstacle to the carbon tax. It sits in front of us. It sits in the Senate. As the Treasurer set out, even the South Australian government is banking the savings for better health, better education and better police services by removing the carbon tax.

  Thank you to the honourable member for her question. I am happy to answer it. What we announced yesterday was that we would put back the $1.2 billion into the school funding model that Labor took from it, including the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party, who was then a minister in the government, who signed up to ripping $1.2 billion from schools. We put that back yesterday, because we thought it was important for school students around Australia to have certainty, to have the resources necessary in every state and territory. We did not believe that there should be second-class students in Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia.                  After spending 11 weeks working with the ministers in the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland, I was very pleased to be able to announce that we had reached a national agreement with those three jurisdictions to incorporate the $1.2 billion to ensure that every student -                      Thank you, Madam Speaker. Of course, what has happened since I reached a national agreement with Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory is that I have asked my officials and their officials to finalise the details of those agreements. But, broadly, what we will do is exactly what we promised before the election.                      Before the election, we said that we would remove the command and control features from Canberra.                      I know they are terribly excited, Madam Speaker.                      They are very excited, especially the member for Melbourne Ports. He rarely gets a go in question time, so we will mention him. We will put him in the Hansard. Madam Speaker, we said that we would dismantle the command and control features from Canberra, and we will. We said that we would remove the red tape and regulation, and we will. Importantly, we said that we would do that for all jurisdictions, but because these new jurisdictions that have signed up to the national agreement start from a clean slate that is exactly the kind of agreements we will put in place. And then next year we will return to the parliament, we will amend the Australian Education Act to do that for all the other jurisdictions that are signatory states. We will remove the red tape and regulation. We will remove the command and control from Canberra. We will ensure that our priorities align with the states and territories priorities, which is teacher quality, parental engagement, principal autonomy and a robust curriculum, because the most important outcome for students is quality and standards.                      The member for Kingston is terribly excited. Maybe that is because she was not mentioned in the Hansard, but now she is! So we will make sure that our priorities and their priorities will accord -                    The member for Kingston then left the chamber.                     Hear, hear! We will treat states and territories like adults, because they are adult governments answerable to their voters in the same way that we are answerable to our voters at federal elections.

  I thank the member for Herbert for his question. I recognise the role that he plays in supporting his local defence community and for the strong advocacy that he demonstrates in pursuing their interests. I congratulate him for that work.                  First, I would like to acknowledge the role that Queensland and Townsville play in defence planning and in supporting our alliance with the United States. The member has referred to the RAAF base in Townsville. That is the primary staging base for the deployment of the ADF overseas and foreign units as well. The member also referred to Australian soldiers in 3rd Brigade, again based around Townsville. These soldiers are deployed all around the world, including alongside our American allies in Afghanistan. It is worth noting that Queensland and Townsville have also been host to the largest joint exercise that the US and Australia undertake - in fact, that the US undertakes - Talisman Saber, which involves about 28,000 personnel. The last joint exercise was conducted in July-August this year.                  The coalition has made a very strong and early start in reaffirming our commitment to the US alliance. The Minister for Defence and I attended the AUSMIN conference, which is the highest level bilateral dialogue that we have with the United States. We were in Washington on 20 November. Senator Johnston and I met with our counterparts, Secretary of State Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. We discussed a whole range of issues to enhance our joint cooperation in the area of defence and security. In particular, we affirmed our commitment to the joint force posture initiatives that were announced by President Obama in November 2011, on which there is bipartisan support -                      If that rude member would just let me finish. We also took the opportunity to sign a statement of principles which underscores the arrangements that will see this joint vision come to fruition. The Minister for Defence also signed a memorandum of understanding for the relocation of a US space telescope to my state of Western Australia. So we get a look in, as well, member for Herbert.                 Over the last few weeks since coming to government we have made sure that Australia's commitment to the US alliance, forged in the Second World War and formally signed under the Menzies government in 1951, remains the bedrock of our national defence and security.

  The only con was Labor's pre-election con to take $1.2 billion out of school funding. That was the con, on top of the $3.8 billion it had earlier taken out of education funding and the $1.6 billion that it had earlier taken out of hospital funding. That is the con, but that is what we expect from members opposite after their great carbon tax con before the 2010 election.                     If I may conclude my answer: unlike members opposite, this government completely keeps its commitments.

  I thank the honourable member for his question. I say to the honourable member that the principal measure that we are undertaking to correct the misleading statements made by the previous government, and continued by the Labor Party about the NBN, is to set out the facts and expose the spin that they have been perpetuating about this project.                 It did not just finish at the time the election; it did not just finish with the end of the Conrovian era. We saw it yesterday at the doors. The member for Blaxland, the shadow minister, was complaining about the coalition's approach to the NBN. An intrepid reporter said, 'But didn't you mess a few things up? Didn't you leave a few problems?' He brushed it off and he brushed it off, but finally - under incredible pressure - he said, 'Yes, there have been problems with the construction. They do need to be fixed, but don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.'                 Really, he should not throw the metaphor out with the cliche, either! This is absolute parrot territory. Really, you can just imagine this process of denial! You can imagine how the member the Adelaide got on with the member the Grayndler, the former minister, when she complained. She said, 'There's no NBN happening in my electorate. There's nothing here.' What did the member the Grayndler say? He said, 'Don't worry, it's not dead. It's just resting. The NBN is just resting.' He said, 'It's just tired! It's had a big squawk lately and it's having a rest!'                 The honourable member asked me what we are doing, apart from exposing their misleading statements. This is what we are doing: we are spelling out every week the rollout statistics of the NBN. We are revealing a statistic that Labor concealed. Labor concealed the fact that one third of all of the brownfield premises they claimed to have passed with fibre could not be connected. There was a rather nice term for it. They were called 'service class zero', because there was zero chance of getting a service.                 That statistic was concealed by the previous government to create the impression that more premises were being passed. They also had this bizarre Orwellian metric, 'premises where construction has commenced or been completed', and 'construction' in the small print was defined as beginning when the plans were first drawn up. This is all stopping. We will shortly be releasing a strategic review which will spell out the objective facts and the truth about this project for the first time in its history.

  I am very glad to have the question from the shadow minister for education. I was asked about Labor's Gonski plan. Can I simply point out that, under Labor's Gonski plan, $1.2 billion had been ripped out. I am very happy to table this graph that I hold: in 2013-14, under the coalition, schools will get $471 million; under Labor, they were going to get $355 million. In 2014-15, under the coalition, they will get $477 million; under Labor, they would have got $258 million. In 2015-16, they will get $736 million; under Labor, they would have got $388 million. And, in 2016-17, the total is $1,111,000,000 - versus the $606 million that they would have got in the forward estimates - in terms of additional funding as a consequence of yesterday's announcement. I table that graph, which the shadow minister might find useful. Under the Gonski plan proposed by the Labor Party, states like South Australia could rip $230 million out of their funding model, and Jennifer Rankine confirmed it today.                 When a Minister is occasionally unable to provide an immediate substantive answer, he or she may either undertake to supply the Member with the requested information in writing at a later date _                  Has the minister -                      You should not reflect on the chair. Madam Speaker, he should not reflect on the chair in the way that he does. It is quite outrageous how rude the Labor Party has become. I was asked about the Labor Party's school funding model. Under the Labor Party's school funding model, South Australia was able to take $230 million out of the funding that they had committed to over the next four years, and Jennifer Rankine said so today. The presenter asked: 'Is it correct, these figures about the $230 million?' Jennifer Rankine: '$230 million we have - that's over a four-year period.' Presenter:                 No, no, no. No, Minister, figures can be very confusing for people listening _ if we can just confirm _ you are planning to cut $230 million from the education budget over four years?                 JENNIFER RANKINE: We have efficiency dividends over _ four years _                 So she confirmed it herself. Under Labor's plan, Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory got $1.2 billion less. Under Labor's plan, states like South Australia could remove $230 million. Under Labor's plan, there was a different indexation rate in every state and territory that had signed up. Under Labor's plan, there was a different percentage of the student resource standard required to be achieved by that state or territory in every state and territory - under Labor's plan. So, with all of this cant and hypocrisy from the Labor Party about their plan versus the new model, the reality is they were taking money -                      It is kind of you to call it the Pyne plan, Prime Minister, but I wouldn't rush to do so! It is more the Abbott plan, or the coalition plan. Under our plan: $1.2 billion more, states being allowed to run their state and territory schools, the Commonwealth delivering its responsibilities to provide support for our students.

  I thank the member for Corangamite, and it is great to have as a new member a champion of the Princes Highway and the Great Ocean Road - and the other parts of the highway network in Victoria. This is a championship which is absolutely essential if there is going to be an achievement of the government's objectives of building the roads of the 21st century, and building them right across the country. She will be very pleased to know that work on planning for the last section of the Princes Highway towards Colac is underway and construction is expected to begin next year. So she will see continuing progress on the upgrading of the Princes Highway.                  There is a similar story in relation to the Great Ocean Road, where the coalition has committed $50 million, in partnership with the Victorian government, to upgrade this iconic road. This of course is one of the great driving experiences of the world, and it is appropriate that this highway continue to be upgraded so that it is safe for motorists and so that the international visitors who come from all over the world just to drive this highway can do so in safety. The member for Wannon will also be interested in this road upgrade, because one of the projects that is going to be constructed is the road close to the Warrnambool cheese factory, which is probably the most famous cheese factory in the world at the present time. This upgrading will benefit the dairy industry and others in that area.                 This is a major construction and upgrading project which has very significant benefits for the local community, the tourism industry and all who want to visit those parts. But it is interesting to note that the Labor Party were not in favour of upgrading the Great Ocean Road. They were opposed to it, and the former member for Corangamite was accusing the coalition of just wanting to dynamite the coast road. We are upgrading it so tourists can enjoy it. But Labor does not want the roads of Australia to be upgraded. We will get on with building the roads of the 21st century and we will do it efficiently and well, in partnership with the state governments.

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh, a great local member. I did a health forum in his electorate just before the election. He showed a great deal of empathy for people who do it tough with their diseases. He provided a way forward for a lot of people. I think he did an excellent job.                 There is a lot for us to argue about in this place, but one of the issues about which I thought there would be no disagreement between the government and the opposition is type 1 diabetes. The previous government announced earlier this year that they were going to provide funding for children who require insulin pumps, children who are suffering the most insidious disease, type 1 diabetes. The former health minister promised that they would be taken care of and provided with funding. After we won the election on 7 September, I thought there would be a lot for us to do in the Health portfolio and I thought the one issue which would have been settled was insulin pumps for those children. I was absolutely amazed and, frankly, disgusted to find that promises had been made to children and to their families earlier this year but a contract had not been signed, that uncertainty had been delivered on those families for all of those months.                 Within five weeks I signed a contract with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation to provide certainty for families. I was absolutely disgusted that the former minister held out hope to families, yet for months and months was not able to put a deal to bed to provide certainty for the families. And it did not stop there, I am sorry to say. The previous government promised money for GP superclinics, which never opened.                     They promised money for programs which never delivered patient outcomes. They promised money to causes and never delivered anything to patients but delivered great big bonuses to union bosses.                     Exactly, right, Madam Speaker. I thank very much the shadow minister for her intervention. She mentions the $35 million that the coalition promised before the election but that Labor never promised. We will deliver that money. Why? Because we want to provide an outcome to those families. We did it in the first instance by providing money for the diabetes pumps, when Labor promised but never delivered. We promised $35 million because we are absolutely determined to have those clinical trials operating, to make sure that we can work towards a cure for those families who are suffering from type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes has an impact not just on the patient but on the entire family.                  Labor promises a lot but never delivers anything. They build up those great big new bureaucracies. We are taking money from them and putting it into clinical trials to make sure that we can get an outcome for Australian families.

  It is terrific to get a question from the shadow minister for clawback! She was always on about that in the last parliament. We are not going to claw back the $1.2 billion that Labor clawed back before the election.                     Assuming the shadow minister is serious, let me say that we will fully deliver the National Disability Insurance Scheme because we want to do the right thing by the people of Australia who have a disability. On schools, those loadings will be fully delivered over the coming four years.

  I thank the member for his question. The draft Productivity Commission report made an interesting observation with regard to labour mobility in that it noted the contribution of labour mobility to productivity. The government is very focused on that. That is why we have committed to introduce a relocation assistance program to ensure that job seekers, particularly young job seekers, have the opportunity to move from an area of low labour market demand to an area of higher labour market demand. That makes total sense, to give job seekers, particularly young job seekers, every opportunity to get a job.                 We propose providing a $3,000 bonus for young job seekers, and job seekers more generally, to relocate to a metropolitan area and $6,000 to relocate to a regional area. But for those job seekers with dependants there is an additional $3,000 payable. I would note, though, this is not just a cash payment; it is a payment that reflects the actual cost for the job seeker to move.                 In addition, we have the job commitment bonus, to encourage young job seekers to get and keep a job. A young person, who is long-term unemployed and who gets a job and keeps it for 12 months, will get a $2,500 bonus. If they remain in employment for two years, they will get an additional $4,000 bonus. These are important programs that help young people to get into work, to enjoy the benefits of work and to spread those benefits of work to the entire community.                 These job programs certainly have a place. But the most important thing that we can do to support job seekers right around the country is to grow the economy. A strong economy creates more jobs and more opportunities for all job seekers and all Australians more generally. That is why we are axing the carbon tax, we are axing the mining tax and we are getting rid of $1 billion worth of red tape. If members opposite were serious about supporting job seekers in need of opportunity, they would get on board with the government and assist us in passing this legislation so that we get these much-needed reforms through the parliament to create opportunities.

  The reason is that Labor left us with $370 billion worth of debt. That is a problem, isn't it? The problem is that Labor spent money in the Health portfolio on building bureaucracies and on services that were not directly benefiting patients. And, yes, we have got tough decisions to make as a government. There is no secret about that. The argument that is being put forward by the opposition really tries to hide the fact that we have not only a Department of Health but also 21 outside agencies, many of them created by the previous government; and, if we want to make sure that we can get money to patients, get better health outcomes and deal with Labor's debt at the same time, then we have to make tough decisions.

  I thank the member for Macarthur for his excellent question and I can inform him that, every day since the election, this government has been cleaning up Labor's mess by keeping our commitments. We are seeking to repeal the carbon tax because that is exactly what the people voted for - a repeal of the carbon tax - and because repealing the carbon tax will help every household in this country to be $550 a year better off. We are repealing the mining tax because that is what the people of Australia voted for and because repealing the mining tax will boost investment, it will boost jobs and it will be a $13 billion boost to the budget bottom line as well. We are attempting to reinstitute temporary protection visas because, again, that is what the people of Australia voted for and because reinstituting temporary protection visas will help clean up Labor's border protection mess. Never let it be forgotten that, under the members opposite, we had 55,000 illegal arrivals by boat, we had an $11 billion border protection budget blow-out and, tragically, we had more than a thousand deaths at sea.                 So we are doing what the people voted for. But it does not matter what the people of Australia voted for; the members opposite are voting against it. They are voting against the carbon tax repeal. They are voting against the mining tax repeal. They are voting against temporary protection visas. But now they are even voting against measures that the former government announced - education measures that the former government announced. Not only are they trying to stop this government from keeping our commitments; they are trying to stop this government from keeping their own commitments. That is the craziness of the current Leader of the Opposition. Today he is out there attacking the government because school education performance declined between 2009 and 2012, as if that is our fault. As if that is our fault! So not only is the Leader of the Opposition in denial about the change of government; he is in denial that he was ever in government! He just does not get it. Don't mind what he says. When it comes to a vote, this Leader of the Opposition always votes for higher taxes and more boats.

  Bad as the Greens are, it was not the Greens who gave us the five biggest deficits in Australian history. It was the members opposite who gave as the five biggest deficits in Australia's history. And, yes, I agree that the Greens have been economic fringe dwellers. That just means members opposite are worse than the Greens when it comes to economic vandalism.

  I thank the honourable member and my neighbour and colleague from the shire for his question. The right policies on border protection are now in the right hands and they are getting the right results. We have had a reduction of more than 80 per cent in illegal arrivals to Australia by boat.                      We are doing that because we are denying people smugglers the product to sell. We are doing that through our deterrence and disruption operations.                      We are doing that by putting offshore processing in place, the way it was designed, not the way the previous government was doing because they had to be dragged kicking and screaming to implement it.                      Here onshore we committed to reintroduce temporary protection visas and we did exactly that. No government that is serious about border protection honours the promises of people smugglers and hands out permanent residency in this country to people who came to Australia illegally by boat. This is what those opposite want to see happen now and that is why they combined together with the Greens the other night to try to keep open the visa shop which they ran for more than five years handing out permanent visas to people who had arrived illegally by boat. Those opposite combined with the Greens the other night to try to open that shop again. That shop is shut. This government has taken action to ensure that, despite the deplorable actions of the Greens and Labor acting in concert, the visa shop for those who have come to Australia illegally by boat is shut. The practice of the previous government was to keep that shop open. The key stewards of that shop sit on the benches opposite.                     There were gold medal performances from many of them. The previous minister for immigration, now Manager of Opposition Business, handed out 539 permanent protection visas during the few short months that he sat in the chair. He also had the highest month of arrivals of any month under their deplorable record in government of 4,239. Then there is the member for Gorton. He handed out 977 permanent protection visas to people who came to Australia illegally by boat, over which time 12,386 people turned up on his watch. His gold-medal performance was ensuring that the boats continued to come on his watch.                      But the stayer was the member for McMahon, now the shadow Treasurer, who handed out 11,122 permanent protection visas to people who came illegally by boat. That is the record. For six years those opposite ran a visa shop for people smugglers. That shop is now shut under this government.

  My advice to the member for McMahon is: don't go into battle with a pocket knife! He has come into this chamber and engaged in debate about debt. Labor is the party of debt. Labor created the debt - more than $400 billion of gross debt - and Labor does not want to accept personal responsibility.                       Here is a revelation: the member for McMahon introduced the debt limit of $75 billion. That did not go too well. Then they increased it to $200 billion, but that did not go too well. Then $250 billion and that did not go too well. Then $300 billion and that has not gone well. Then Labor left us with a debt legacy that well exceeds $400 billion -                      and that is after we left them in government with a net asset position of $60 billion. We left them $60 billion in net assets and Labor has left us with gross debt of over $400 billion. Prime Minister, I never would have thought I would be standing at the dispatch box saying the Greens are proving to be more reasonable than the Labor Party. I cannot believe it. The Greens were business partners with the Labor Party in the last government. They were so close to each other that we were watching the wedding video. Do remember that? That is how close they were. I sense there is now a bit of separation anxiety.                     I say to the member for McMahon: there are no concessions because we believe in transparency. Do you know what? Transparency is foreign to the Labor Party. In the last term of government the Labor Party spent so much time knifing each other in the back that they forgot to run the country. So the debt and deficit blew out and now the Greens are saying to us, 'We recognise that someone needs to accept responsibility for this. We are prepared, in good faith, to help you address the problems that Labor left behind.' So, if the Greens are prepared to be reasonable on a budgetary matter, I am prepared to accept that. Everyone is entitled to a cathartic change in attitude. I welcome that. They are fantastic. I say to the member for McMahon: you left us with your problems; do not stop us from fixing them.

  I thank the member for Fairfax for his question and I congratulate him on his recent election to this place. I hope that he and all members of his group can make a very constructive contribution to the deliberations of this parliament. On the question the member has asked -                      I remind the member for Fairfax, his fellow Independents and the minor party members up there on the crossbenches that it has never been the practice of any government in this country to comment on the specifics of operational intelligence matters. I also make the point that no-one's phone can be tapped - no-one's conversations can be listened into - without a specific warrant. Our intelligence services, both here and abroad, operate under the very strictest of safeguards. Firstly, there is the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Security and Intelligence and, secondly, there is the Inspector-General of Security and Intelligence. So I can assure the member for Fairfax that he can speak in peace, so to speak, without any fear that anything untoward is going on.

  I thank the member for Canning for his question. He has, for many years, been a keen advocate in this place for strong border protection.                  The previous government left behind a considerable mess on many fronts, but there is no greater mess than the one they have left behind on our borders. Over 50,000 people turned up illegally by boat under  the previous government. The secret the previous government never wanted to share with the Australian people before the last election is that 33,000 of those people who arrived on their watch remain onshore, unprocessed and undetermined - leaving behind a massive backlog of chaos to be addressed by an incoming government. They simply wanted to dump the problem on a future government. My colleagues and I are all having to deal with the problems they have dumped on us as we go through the process of seeking to restore sense to government policy, particularly in this area.                  When you leave 33,000 people in immigration detention, on bridging visas and in community detention, that has a profound impact on the way the system works. It draws down heavily on the resources of the immigration department and impacts on their ability to address the many other areas of important work we do. But the single greatest impact on the immigration program caused by the failures of the previous government was that the loss of confidence Australians had in our border protection led to them questioning the immigration program itself. That is a tragedy. What we are doing is restoring that confidence in our borders and restoring that confidence in our immigration program. The way we are doing that is by moving to restore temporary protection visas.                     When, upon coming into government, we announced that we were restoring temporary protection visas, 181 people out of that 33,000 decided to go home - because they were not going to hang around just to get a temporary protection visa. They had been hanging around hoping to get a permanent visa. But Labor and the Greens combined to vote against what the Australian people voted for. They voted to honour the promises of the people smugglers, a promise made on their watch to the people who came here on their watch. Labor and the Greens wanted to close the deal and keep the visa shop open for those the previous government, through their own border failures, had invited into this place.                  But there are many other measures that we are introducing. We are withdrawing taxpayer funded assistance for migration and legal advice on their claims.                      We are ending the tick-and-flick process that led to more than 90 per cent of claims just being rushed through the system because the visa shop owners over there could not be too quick or too hasty to hand out those visas to them.                      We are introducing mutual obligation arrangements for those who remain here and we are working hard to send people who are not refugees home. That is what we are doing; we are cleaning up the mess. This is a mess left behind by the previous government and we are cleaning it up.

  I thank the member opposite for her question. I am very concerned about what this report shows about declining academic standards between 2009 and 2012, when - guess who? - members opposite were in government.                      Who was in government between 2009 and 2012?                     Members opposite, led by their leader, are bellowing, 'No excuses!' I do not intend to offer excuses for Labor's bad performance. They offer excuses; I will not. I must tell the Leader of the Opposition that academic standards declined seriously when he was the education minister, when the former government was in power, despite -                      Academic standards declined when the Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Education despite Commonwealth real spending on schools going up by 10 per cent in that period. They spent more money and got worse results - that is the truth. We will put back the $1.2 billion that they ripped out -                    The member for Isaacs then left the chamber.                     We will put that money back, but it is not all about money. It is also about higher standards and, unlike members opposite, we will work with the states to bring about greater principal autonomy, greater school autonomy, greater parental involvement and higher standards.

  I am grateful to the member for Ryan for asking about this very serious issue. Unfortunately the Program for International Student Assessment results released today are the worst results for Australia since this assessment was created in 2000. They are the worst results by a long chalk. Between 2009 and 2010, Australia's ranking in the PISA fell from 10th to 16th in science, from 15th to 19th in maths and from ninth to 14th in reading - the biggest drops ever in the 13 years of PISA.                     This is despite the fact that over the period of the previous Labor government they spent almost $20 billion in new spending on things like school halls and laptops and computers. Building the Education Revolution cost the taxpayer almost $20 billion. In real terms they increased education spending by 10 per cent, and in that period they were entirely responsible for a drop in the education outcomes of our Australian students. The Leader of the Opposition was out there today blaming the Howard government. Not only is the Leader of the Opposition a government change denier; he is now a Gillard government denier. Apparently it never happened. They are like the Rip Van Winkle years - the last six years never occurred. There was no Rudd government, there was no Gillard government. There is no way that the opposition can get away from the fact that from 2006 to 2013 they were in power. These PISA results were taken entirely when they were in power. It had nothing to do with the Howard government.                  The Leader of the Opposition tried to blame the SES funding model. The SES funding model, which Labor say they hate, delivered 10 per cent more spending to schools in real terms in that period and results declined. Why did they decline? It was because of Labor's complete failure to recognise that money is not everything in education. It is about teacher quality, it is about a robust curriculum, it is about parental engagement, it is about principal autonomy and it is about discipline. Labor always completely misses the point on education. They think if you throw more money at a problem it will be solved. The PISA results today indicate that that is completely false - you can spend more and more money, which they insist on doing, but unless you get teacher quality right you will not bring about better outcomes. PISA also found that in Australia it was teacher quality that was the No. 1 determinant of student outcomes. It said that it did not matter what school you went to; it mattered which teacher your class was allocated.

  The only group that you cannot trust are members of the Australian Labor Party. There was nothing equitable about ripping $1.2 billion out of schools in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. What was fair and reasonable about having a system of school funding that was neither fair nor national? The people of Australia trust this government to keep its commitments to clean up Labor's mess, and that is exactly what we are doing.

  I thank the member for La Trobe for winning back his seat. I am sure that Jason Wood 2.0 is going to be even better than Jason Wood 1.0, because he shares the same values that we all share, and they are that you want to have a strong economy with good jobs growth and you want to give people hope that tomorrow is going to be better than today. Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the September quarter national accounts. This is the final statement on the economy that Labor left behind. It shows that the economy is growing at below trend. It shows rising unemployment and it proves that the deficit has been deteriorating. It also proves that the debt is going to keep increasing. The fact of the matter is that the economy is now going to have to deal with the fact that mining investment is going to come off from around eight per cent of GDP to three per cent of GDP. One of the challenges for us - which we are up for - is that we have to build the infrastructure that is going to help to drive a productive economy over the next few years. It is now time to retool Australia for the challenges that lie ahead. The Prime Minister - the infrastructure Prime Minister - is absolutely committed to that, as are all members of the coalition.                     But there is a roadblock - the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party is blocking initiatives, like the abolition of the carbon tax, that are going to help to grow the Australian economy. This will, in fact, grow the Australian economy because of its abolition. As proven by Treasury data, the carbon tax is a handbrake on growth, there is no doubt about that. But the Labor Party wants to keep that handbrake in place. When you have mining investment coming off, the Labor Party's solution is to do everything it can to keep a tax on mining. When mining investment is coming off, what does the Labor Party do? It says, 'Do everything you can possibly do to make it harder to open a mine in Australia.' That is what it wants.                 Well, that is the Labor Party, because the Labor Party just does not get it. It does not understand that more taxes and more regulation inhibit growth. They inhibit aspiration. They inhibit the capacity of business to employ more people and to give Australians hope that tomorrow will be better than today. The Labor Party thinks of the last six years as a great big black hole. Nothing happened. The problem is the damage that it has done. What it has left Australia with is an economy that is underperforming. It is stuck in second gear. But what I say to the Australian people is: the coalition is up for the challenge. We are ready to help to grow the Australian economy.

  I am grateful to get this question from the member for Parramatta. The government announced on Monday that we would put an extra $1.2 billion into schools in the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia to pay for the loadings -                      We announced on Monday that we would put an extra $1.2 billion into Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland, which will pay for base funding and loadings in those states over the next four years. That is the formula for the model and so, axiomatically, that means that loadings and the base funding will be contributed to by the Commonwealth. That also means that, from 2014 onwards, New South Wales, Tasmania, South Australia, Victoria and the ACT will all have their funding entirely secured. This means that loadings and base funding will also be paid for, contributed to by the Commonwealth in those states and territories. What the government can guarantee is that we are putting $1.2 billion more into the school funding model to ensure that the full amount of money flows to the states -                      One of the members opposite just said, 'Has he even mentioned loadings?' I think if they check the Hansard record they will find I have mentioned it several times already in this answer. If the member for Parramatta knew anything about how the model worked, she would have been too embarrassed to move her point of order, because, of course, the Commonwealth pays the money to the states and territories. The states and territories distribute it to the students and to the schools. This was the model under Labor, under the Howard government, under the Rudd-Gillard government - which apparently never happened - and it is the model under the Abbott government. It is called block funding to states and territories and to the Catholics. The only schools that are directly funded by the Commonwealth are independent schools, and even that money flows through the states first and then to the independent schools. The whole problem with the opposition's position on this is that they do not understand the model. They do not understand the education system. It is very complicated, I grant you, but when the member for Parramatta is given a question by the Manager of Opposition Business in the House she should check it herself. Because by the very fact of putting $1.2 billion in that the Leader of the Opposition ripped out, we are securing the funding for all other states and territories. If Labor had been re-elected, there would have been no conditions, loadings or base funding support for Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory, because Labor was giving them a great big fat zero.                     They were giving them nothing at all. The public will dismiss all the cant and hypocrisy you hear from the other side of the House, because they know that one side is giving $1.2 billion, while the other side was giving a great big fat zero to three important jurisdictions in Australia.

  I thank the member for Casey. He was around when the coalition last took government; he was working in Peter Costello's office. And he will well remember the Beazley black hole - the $10 million Beazley black hole. Well, now we have a Bowen black hole that is far larger than the Beazley black hole, and it continues to grow. The Labor Party has not only bequeathed us a budget with deficits as far as the eye could see - and when we release MYEFO in the next few days, you will see just how bad the books have been under Labor - but it goes beyond that: the Labor Party is so determined to wreak havoc on the Australian budget - from opposition - that they are opposing not only the savings that we took to the last election but also the savings that they took to the last election. Hang on, they not only want us to keep our promises, but they want us to break their promises. That is exactly what Labor wants. Not only are they saying, 'Well, we are not going to allow you to reduce the debt by $13 billion, by getting rid of the mining tax' - no, no - and, 'Not only are we going to prevent you reducing the debt by $7 to $8 billion, by getting rid of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation'. Oh no: they want to prevent us from reducing the debt because they want to go against their own election savings. They announced the savings to fund the Gonski education reforms. Let's get this right: Labor wants us to keep their policies when it comes to expenditure but they do not want us to keep their policies when it comes to the savings to pay for that expenditure. That is pathetic. It is genuinely pathetic. You know, in opposition, you actually have to have economic integrity - and the Labor Party has none. It had none in government. It has none in opposition.                     I see a chortling member for Lilley over there - what a cracker! I want the member for Lilley to stay in this parliament as long as possible. That is what I want. Don't go away, Wayne! We know he is shopping his CV around every headhunter around the Southern Hemisphere but I say to the member for Lilley: don't go away - because the member for Lilley is going to be a constant reminder of the hypocrisy of Labor. He stood at this very dispatch box, beat his chest and said, 'It is outrageous, isn't it? - it is outrageous that we want to try and run a reasonable budget and the opposition over there is stopping us'. I would say to the member for Lilley: whisper in the ear of the Leader of the Opposition and explain to him that economic credibility comes from doing the hard yards.

  The good news for the parliament is that the coalition announced on Monday that we would spend $1.2 billion more on school education - so that students in Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia were not treated as second-class citizens. We expect the states to make whatever contribution their budget allows them to towards the entire funding - to the loadings and to the base funding for the new school funding model - because we intend to treat the states and territories like adults. We do not believe in the central command and control model that Labor believes in - running things from Canberra. As I explained yesterday to the member for Adelaide - and it is no wonder she has given this question to the member for Parramatta today, because yesterday the member for Adelaide was delivered a lesson on how the system works in Australia - there are state schools and there are non-government schools. The non-government schools are run by Catholics, Lutherans, Anglicans, and independent Christians; there are Jewish schools; Muslim schools; and some are entirely non-denominational. And then there are state schools. And they are owned and operated by the states and territories. So we have decided that a good way to fund schools is to treat the states and territories like they are adults. The Commonwealth will make its contribution; in fact, we will go even further than the promise Labor made in the election. Labor wanted to give $1.6 billion -                      to schools; we will give $2.8 billion to schools over the next four years. We have put $1.2 billion in; Labor ripped out $1.2 billion. The member for Parramatta talks about strings being attached to New South Wales funding. The Labor Party's model was not that it had no strings attached - it had no money attached! If I was a state Treasurer or Premier, I would prefer the money to the strings. The coalition will provide the money to the states and territories, and we will treat them like adults, as they deserve. And they will be answerable to their electors at their election times in the same way as we are answerable to ours.

  I am surprised and delighted to get a question from a Queensland Labor member about the school funding model, because the Manager of Opposition Business is setting up a number of his colleagues today. Under the Labor Party, Queensland would have been denied $794 million in funding.                     If the member for Rankin were sitting on this side of the House, he would be saying to the students of Woodridge High School - I think it was - 'We're going to leave you $794 million short across Queensland.' What an own goal! He is not exactly a neophyte in this building. I think the member used to work for the Treasurer, and so something has rubbed off on the member for Rankin, and it is not good. The former Treasurer used to stand up and drop a few clangers in this place and the current Treasurer used to pick him up. The poor old member for Rankin has been sent out there and told to run in front of that vehicle to see if it runs him down. If it doesn't, and you get up, we'll look after you.                     The member for Rankin mentions disadvantaged children and it is a very good question, because every child in Queensland would have been disadvantaged under the Labor Party if they had been re-elected. Every single student in Queensland -                      Every single student in Queensland would be a disadvantaged student under a Labor government, but under the Abbott government, they are $794 million better off. The Labor Party talks about 'no strings attached', and the member for Rankin made the same error. Under the Labor Party, there were strings attached for Queensland, but there was no money for Queensland. Let me pull the member for Rankin up. The Leader of the Opposition, before the election, did a deal with Victoria, and Denis Napthine pinged him, because he said at the last minute - as late as Saturday night - 'We had an agreement finally from the federal government that they were prepared to amend the Education Act to confirm the autonomy of Victorian government schools.' In other words, the Leader of the Opposition planned to remove the so-called strings attached before the election. Now, after the election, he is trying to pretend that he was standing up for disadvantaged children. Only one side of the House is standing up for disadvantaged children and it is the one that has put $794 million back into Queensland so that Woodridge High School students get the fair deal they deserve.

  I thank the honourable member for his question and recall the broadband forums we have held in consultations in his electorate. I can say that the coalition is acutely aware that many parts of Australia have no broadband at all. In fact it is estimated that about two million premises have no broadband at all, which is exactly the same number as in 2007. So, after six years, nothing has been improved. That is why, by the end of the month, I will have a report from my department setting out the ranking of Australia's neighbourhoods in order of their broadband needs, and the NBN's rollout will be prioritised accordingly. So neighbourhoods in the honourable member's electorate which have a high-priority need will be dealt with in priority, as opposed to the current case where, as the member for Chifley knows well, the fibre network is being rolled out in areas of his electorate where there are not one but two high-speed broadband services already available.                 One of the problems in the central business district of Townsville is that the previous government, for purely ideological reasons, refused to allow NBN Co. to connect its fibre to a multiplex in the basement of an office building or a block of apartments and then connect to the copper network in the building, which in modern buildings is of very high quality. This is pure ideology. As a consequence, nearly half of all the premises in Townsville that are supposedly passed with NBN fibre cannot connect at all. We are trialling the fibre-to-the- basement technology, which is commonplace everywhere else in the world, and that will ensure that the CBD of Townsville gets connected in a timely way.                 The Labor Party has often struggled with getting over these final hurdles, such as actually connecting people to the network. So imagine my surprise yesterday when the former NBN Co. CEO said, 'Were it not for one more problem and the network could have been built on time and on budget.' He said, 'I didn't think we were going to have a problem with digging holes in the ground.' Given that the project involved digging holes in every street and every front garden in Australia, it is remarkable this problem came as a surprise. It does cause me to wonder what the proponents of other mismanaged ventures could have said as they reflected on the failures: 'I didn't think we would have problems with icebergs' - captain of the Titanic. 'I didn't think we would have a problem with frostbite' - Napoleon.                  All of this disastrous mismanagement is a consequence once again of Labor not doing their homework, and once again it falls to the coalition to clean up Labor's mess.

  I thank the member for Adelaide for her question, but I must admit it is starting to feel like a turkey shoot up here. I am almost feeling sorry for the member for Adelaide, because she spent all last week saying we were not putting enough money into education, then we put $1.2 billion into education and now she is saying we are putting too much money into education. What is it? Is it too much? Is it too little? The previous government put 10 per cent more into education. They put $16.4 billion into school halls.                   The member for Sydney then left the chamber.                     They put $2.6 billion into laptops in schools. Is the shadow minister now saying that that was all wasted money? We thought a lot of it was wasted. Like the member for Perth, we are suddenly on the same team again. This is like being attacked by a pot plant! But I will treat the question seriously. The member for Adelaide asks us about whether we are putting too much money in.                      So in effect she has admitted that the previous government took the $1.2 billion out; we have put it back in. We always said we would keep our election commitments, and we have. We have gone further than our election commitments. We have put $1.2 billion more in, but we have always said that funding is only one element of education, which is something Labor has not caught up with.                      We have talked about curriculum -                      we have talked about autonomy, we have talked about teacher quality, we have talked about parental engagement -                      All of those priorities are shared by the states and territories, by the non-government sector, whether it is independent or Catholic. I look forward to working with all my state and territory colleagues, with the Catholics and with the independents to bring about better quality and standards for our students. At least one side of the House takes education seriously. It is this side of the House.

  I thank the member for Leichhardt for his passionate advocacy for those living in his electorate, across Australia and in our region, particularly PNG, who are suffering from these debilitating diseases. The Australian government joins with successive governments in investing heavily in the care, prevention and cure of these debilitating diseases. Over a decade, in relation to HIV-AIDS alone, Australian governments have invested about $1 billion in our region. In relation to malaria, the Prime Minister recently led the way in establishing the Asia Pacific Leaders Malaria Alliance to continue to battle these diseases. Indeed, overnight the Australian Ambassador to the United States, the Hon. Kim Beazley, gave the Australian government's pledge of $200 million over three years to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.                  Two-hundred million dollars is precisely the same amount that the Labor government delivered in the last three years. One would have thought, given the deterioration in the budget over the last three years - the fact that five record budget deficits were delivered by this opposition when in government, the fact that the debt is now skyrocketing past $400 billion - that we would have heard bipartisan support for this significant pledge over three years of $200 million. It is precisely the same amount that Labor delivered.                 But no. The now absent Deputy Leader of the Opposition went on the attack and tried to turn our three-year pledge into a political pointscoring exercise. Her mischief knows no bounds. Not only has she been kicked out of the House but what she did not say to the Australian people is that Labor broke their pledge to the global fund. In fact, in 2010 Labor pledged $210 million over three years to fight these diseases and then a couple of years later, when they thought the global fund was not watching, they ripped $10 million out of the global fund commitment. It is not only the Australian people who cannot trust Labor; the global fund and the international community cannot trust Labor.                 But it gets worse. At the last election, when Labor left office, not one dollar, no money at all, was allocated in the aid budget forward estimates. They left office without a dollar in the aid budget forward estimates. That is such hypocrisy. It is about time the Labor Party took responsibility for the mess in which they have left our economy.

  I thank the honourable member for his question and must note that we have adjoining seats. One of our towns is Urbenville. On the way to Urbenville, from either my side or his side, you go past lots of what Paul Howes from the AWU would call ma and pa farms. It is an absolute insult that this has been turned into a pejorative. It is something that reflects in excess of 95 per cent of Australian farming.                 But at Urbenville we could talk about the things that the coalition are doing for farming, such as the farm finance package which we have got out today. We have managed to sign off all the mainland states and territories so that we can provide a product that the Labor Party were unable to provide. We would be able to talk about getting the live cattle trade up and running again -                      and how we have managed to put a floor back into the cattle market after we found out one night that the country was not being run by the government; it was being run by Four Corners. It was an absolute disaster for the people in that trade.                     We would be able to talk about the election promise we made about the white paper and how we are looking forward to a great future for all farming families in this nation. We would be able to talk about the Northern Australia white paper and how we see a new economic horizon for farming in this nation. We would be able to talk about inland rail and how we are developing major infrastructure to absolutely increase the capacity for the logistics in inland Australia.                 But I think it is extremely important that we also talk about Mr Paul Howes, because Mr Paul Howes was instrumental in both the selection and the execution of two former prime ministers of this nation. I find it an absolute insult that, from his lofty heights, he would make a disparaging comment about all family farms. I would like to know if this is the view of his colleague in the AWU, the Leader of the Opposition. Does he also believe that this is the end for ma and pa farms? Is it the end for farming families? Is that the view of the AWU? Is that the view of the Australian Labor Party?                 After we get rid of ma and pa farms, are we going to get rid of ma and pa suburbs? Are we going to get rid of ma and pa small businesses? Are we going to put in their place a corporate farm where the future for the sons and daughters of the people who are listening to this is swinging a spanner on someone else's farm? The vision we in the coalition have is that we will own the farm - the Australian family will own the Australian farm. There is a great future for Australian families, and there is a great future in the Australian farm.

  I thank the honourable member for her question. This is an incredibly important issue for all Australians. About 150,000 chemotherapy patients each year in our country need infusions. The government provides a great deal of support to those services and to the delivery of those drugs. Sadly, those patients were left in great uncertainty under Labor. This is an issue that should have been put to bed a long time ago by the previous government. The problem is that the Labor Party created a difficulty for the delivery of those chemotherapy services. It caused enormous disruption; many providers said that they would withdraw their services. The previous government put in place some funding, but only six months worth of funding. The most offensive part is that the funding was to have run out on 31 December this year. Potentially, families were facing the dilemma that, over the Christmas break, they were going to have their chemotherapy services cut in the New Year. It was unconscionable. It was one of Labor's worst acts in government. If people think that the Labor mess only extends to education and the way they ripped money out of the economy and wasted billions of dollars, they are wrong.                 I am sorry to say that the health portfolio is littered with difficulties of Labor's creation. Last Saturday, the Prime Minister and I went to Sydney, where we made an announcement that we would put in $80 million to provide certainty to those chemotherapy patients. We said to those patients that they could have a Christmas and New Year of certainty knowing that they will be provided with those chemotherapy services. There is certainty for those families. We found a mess of Labor's creation. We fixed it up. We provided certainty to those patients. We will continue until we get better outcomes and more certain futures for Australian patients.

  I thank the member for Braddon for his question and I can assure him that we are cleaning up Labor's mess by keeping our commitments for the benefit of families and small business in particular. I can inform him that, on day one of the new government's life, we saved the car industry from Labor's fringe benefits tax hit, and we saved nurses, teachers and tradies from Labor's hit on their self-education expenses. We have announced that most of the former government's 100 announced-but-not-enacted tax changes will not go ahead, because that will lower taxes and reduce paperwork. We have closed 21 non-statutory bodies as a downpayment on our commitment to reduce business red-tape costs by $1 billion a year.                 The carbon tax repeal legislation has passed through the House of Representatives, as has the mining tax repeal legislation, and there are bills before this parliament to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which will be a strong cop on the beat in a tough industry. The Commission of Audit is well underway, and the son-of-Wallis inquiry into the financial services sector is about to start.                 Yesterday I released draft terms of reference for the first big review of competition policy since the Hilmer review two decades back. Handled properly, competition policy reform is an important microeconomic advance and the Hilmer reforms added some 2½ per cent to Australia's gross domestic product. As well, big infrastructure projects like WestConnex in Sydney, the East West Link in Melbourne, the Gateway Upgrade Project in Brisbane, the north-south road in Adelaide, the Perth Gateway and the Pacific Highway and the Bruce Highway upgrades are being accelerated.                 We are dealing with Labor's debt legacy. I congratulate the Treasurer for his successful negotiations. He could not get responsibility out of the Labor Party but he did get responsibility out of the Greens. What a miracle worker this Treasurer is. And we are fixing the National Broadband Network, which was billions over budget and years behind schedule. We are playing our part to improve schools, which have gone backwards academically over the last five years despite Labor spending 10 per cent more in real terms. We are doing the job we were elected to do for the benefit of Australia's families and small businesses.

  It was a terrific plan that we went to the election with. Madam Speaker, you would be aware of it. It was a terrific plan that focused on building a stronger economy, on getting Labor's budget deficit under control, on putting in place a program to start to pay down Labor's debt, on removing regulation which is a handbrake on the Australian economy and a handbrake on so many businesses, and on giving Australians more control over their lives and not having Canberra second-guess every aspect of their being.                 We put in place a policy program which focused on removing those handbrakes by getting rid of the carbon tax. Getting rid of the carbon tax is going to grow the Australian economy. It is going to help every household in Australia by $550 a year. The Labor Party said they were going to terminate the carbon tax but they are so determined to terminate the carbon tax that they have voted to keep it! That is the Labor Party. We should not be surprised about that because they were so appalled at the failure of the mining tax to raise any money that they want to keep it. The mining tax itself is a cost to the budget of over $13½ billion, but the Labor Party has decided that it wants to deepen the deficit and increase the debt that was the legacy of Labor. They want to do it in opposition was well as having done it in government. That is quite an achievement.                 We had the courage to go to the election with $42 billion of savings. We were upfront with the Australian people. That is a courageous thing to do. In politics to go to an election with $42 billion worth of savings is not terribly popular but it is the right thing to do. Labor also went to the election with savings, like $2.3 billion on higher education cuts to pay for the Gonski education proposals. I am reminded of the statement by Craig Emerson, the former minister for education - he even had a great graph showing how the Labor Party was increasing expenditure on education despite the cuts. Labor is now so concerned about the cuts they announced that they are going to oppose their own cuts. The Labor Party is so determined to ensure that we keep their policy on Gonski that they are going to vote against the funding of it. That is Labor Party hypocrisy. The problem is that the Labor Party had no principles in government and it has no principles in opposition. It is only good at stabbing itself on the back and now it is very good at being a hypocrite.

  I am honoured to become a North Queenslander. I did not know, however, that there was going to be an entry tax of a billion dollars for a Pentland project! But there is no doubt that it is only the coalition that cares about North Queensland. I know the member for Kennedy cares about North Queensland from the numerous occasions I have been there and the numerous occasions he has bitten my ear off. From the meetings I have had with him and various others in North Queensland, I know that the north of Australia has the capacity to become the engine room of the Australian economy in the 21st century. There is no doubt about that and it is something the Prime Minister has embraced. Our commitment is reflected most immediately in the fact that, under the free trade agreement announced by the Prime Minister today, sugar exported from Australia to Korea will have no tariffs on it. That is a huge win for North Queensland and a huge win for Australia. So we are delivering the goods. In relation to the particular project the member for Kennedy asked about, I defer to the Deputy Prime Minister and ask him to add to the answer.

  I particularly want to acknowledge the member for Bass, who, as a former head of the Australian Parachute Training School, knows more than a little bit about aviation.                     He knows his way in and out of a plane! This question comes on a day on which a thousand job losses in the aviation sector have been announced. A thousand job losses were announced by Qantas before question time today. So the Australian aviation sector is clearly a sector under real pressure. In Qantas's annual report of 2013, released the day before the election, they acknowledged:                 The introduction of the carbon tax drove up operating expenses by $106 million.                 The Virgin Australia annual report of 27 September 2013 said:                 The company was also impacted by the carbon tax during the 2013 financial year, with a $47.9 million cost of which we were unable to recover _                     These costs are real - $106 million in the case of Qantas and a $47 million hit in the case of Virgin airlines, which they themselves said in their own annual report they were unable to recover. Those opposite can sit there in denial, but the costs are real. It goes on: Air Ambulance Victoria was hit with a $205,000 carbon tax cost. The costs are real. This is not surprising, because from the other side we get statements such as this from the member for Port Adelaide:                 _ Labor supports terminating the carbon tax.                 We have the member for Wakefield saying:                 I think we should abstain in the Senate, allow the Abbott government to implement its policies _                 Senator Mark Bishop said:                 The strong public position of the ALP prior to the election and in the election was completely rebuffed by the electorate.                 What did the chairperson of Rex Aviation said when Rex had to face this? He said:                 However, there is little we can do when the Federal Government -                  he was talking about the ALP -                  appears to be hell-bent on destroying regional aviation and along with it, pretty much the rest of the economy.                 We can fix aviation, but get out of the way.

  The Leader of the Opposition is right in one sense - we have relied on the Greens to pass one particular piece of legislation. Members opposite relied on the Greens to survive in government for three long years. The hypocrisy and double standards of members opposite are extraordinary. We have come to an arrangement with the Greens on this particular subject because it was impossible to come to a sensible arrangement with the Labor Party, and when it comes to economic responsibility the current Labor Party is worse than the Greens.

  I thank the member for Dobell for her first question, after a magnificent first speech. One of the things that the electorate on the Central Coast knew was that a vote for Karen McNamara and the coalition was a vote to put the business back into small business. I have seen the article to which the member refers. It captures the challenge faced by outer metropolitan areas and areas such as the Central Coast where small business is the economy. This is where small businesses provide the livelihoods, the vitality in the community, the chance for young people to get a start. This article captured how under the last years of the Labor government the small business economy had frozen and opportunities were being lost. Local traders were reflecting on electricity costs doubling, freight costs spiralling and other costs of doing business increasing, and were saying to themselves that they were surprised more businesses had not shut under Labor.                 At the election there was a choice - a choice for the people of Dobell to have more of the same, where 412,000 jobs had been lost in small business under Labor; where at the end of Labor there were 3,000 fewer small businesses employing people than was the case when Labor was first elected. The people could choose whether they wanted to stop the decline in the employment provided by the small business sector. Fifty-three per cent of all employment in the private sector workforce when Labor were elected was provided by small business. By the time they left, it had gone down to 43 per cent. So there was a choice, and I am pleased to say that in vast numbers the people of the Central Coast said it was time for a change, time to put the business back into small business. There was a comprehensive small business plan, some of which Labor had voted against twice. Do you remember ending the pay clerk role with the paid parental leave? Labor had voted against that twice. They argued it would have been a devastating blow. But in a thought bubble, trying to come up with some small business policy, they tried to pinch the coalition's policy. They came in here yesterday arguing that we should go and change the very policy that they defended for six years.                 This article connects with the real life of small business. The carbon tax has been absolutely punishing for small business. Not only did Labor want to keep the tax but they wanted to see it go up and up. Labor's strategy proposes to extend it to freight costs - one of the concerns raised in this article. We are coming up to Christmas. The opposition leader has some choices. Does he want to deliver a $550 Christmas benefit each year for Australian households and help restore consumer confidence? He can do that by axing the carbon tax. Does he want to help the small business community of Dobell? He can axe the carbon tax. The message from small businesses across Australia is: Bill Shorten, axe the carbon tax.

  I thank the member for Durack for her ongoing interest in this issue. I know her constituents are very interested in ensuring that we get strong borders back in place in Australia, because the borders we inherited from the previous government were in serious disrepair. She will be pleased to know that the number of people who have arrived illegally by boat since Operation Sovereign Borders began has fallen by more than 80 per cent. That compares with the period after the regional resettlement arrangement, which is nothing more than a hollow shell that we inherited from the previous government - a shell that we have had to deal with with underfunding and lack of capacity. It was not surprising that we inherited such an empty shell because it was a policy -                      It was a policy introduced under protest by the previous government, because for years and years when they were in government they said offshore processing should not be reintroduced. They actually abolished offshore processing. They said that it would never work and that it was something that we should never reintroduce. Under protest - after being dragged kicking and screaming - it was restored. But it had to be left to this government to do it properly.                     Under this government, the quick, rapid exit to Nauru and Manus Island of people who come to Australia directly has been put in place. We are actually putting the substance that is making the difference into that arrangement, because the right policy is now in the right hands and it is getting the right results.                 The other thing that we did to get these results when we came to government was to introduce temporary protection visas. When we did that we were honouring the promise that we made to the people of Australia to deny permanent residency to people who came to Australia illegally by boat. This was endorsed by their mandate at the election. Those opposite teamed up with the Greens. They voted to honour the promise of people smugglers to people who had come illegally to Australia by boat. What those opposite did not understand was that you cannot say you are not going to resettle anyone in Australia permanently and then, at the same time, hand out permanent protection visas to people who came illegally to Australia by boat. The previous minister for immigration, the former Manager of Government Business in the Senate, handed out 539 permanent visas to people who arrived illegally by boat. That was 269 on average per month. The member for Gorton handed out 195 per month. That was 977 in total. But none was better than the member for McMahon who had a total of 11,122, with an average - a gold medal performance - of 384 per month. You cannot have policies that work against each other. It was a government that was divided against itself. It was divided on borders, and that was why they were such a sorry show.

  The government appreciates that these are not easy times for many Australian manufacturers. We appreciate that some iconic businesses such as Qantas are under significant competitive pressure. We appreciate that, and obviously we grieve for every worker whose job has been lost. We grieve for them, and we appreciate just how difficult this is for them and for their families. The best thing that we, as a government, can do for the workers of Australia generally - and particularly for the workers whose businesses are in trouble - is do our best to create a strong and prosperous economy. I do not say that that is easy, and I do not say that there is any one measure which is some kind of magic wand. But there are things which good governments can do purposefully, carefully and methodically which will improve things. We have to get taxes down. We have to get regulation down. We have to have predictability and consistency in decision making. That is what this government is determined to provide. We have made a very good start and it would be even better if members opposite would not constantly try to oppose the policies that we took to the election.                     The Leader of the Opposition, who never shuts up, is sitting in that chair there saying, 'I know how you feel.'                 Well, there is this difference. When the coalition were in opposition -                      When the coalition were in opposition, we fought to prevent a government from breaking its commitments. This opposition is fighting to prevent a government from keeping its commitments. That is the difference.

  I thank the honourable member for Dawson for his question. Of all of the examples of Labor mismanagement, the Mackay soccer fields are certainly amongst those with the prizes. This is a $1 million commitment that the Labor Party gave to the Mackay football playing fields project. They made that commitment before the 2010 federal election, but nothing happened for three years, until finally the then minister for regional development wrote to the Mackay football club and said, 'I am pleased to advise you that I have approved funding of up to $1 million, GST inclusive, under the Community Infrastructure Grants Program for the Mackay regional football playing fields project.' That letter was dated 5 August 2013, after the election had been called, but it did not arrive at the soccer club until 23 September, two weeks after the election had been held. So Labor promised this project three years ago and promised it again, but the letter to say it was going to happen arrived two weeks after this government came into office. Isn't that typical! Labor promises and fails to deliver. The coalition will deliver this project.                     The member for Dawson is able to assure his constituents that the project will be delivered. But of course there are dozens of those projects. Labor are telling everyone -                      that the coalition should be honouring nearly 1,000 election promises that they made during the period of the election campaign itself or in the lead-up. If the Labor Party actually believe that one party should honour the other party's promises, why aren't you voting for the abolition of the carbon tax? Why aren't you voting for the abolition of the mining tax? Why aren't you continuing to vote for your own promise to cut university funding? This is hypocrisy on a grand scale. The Labor Party expect us to honour their promises, even though they vote against it. We will deliver our own promises, but now we have to also help out the former 2010 Labor government to deliver some of theirs.

  Thank you to the member for Deakin. It is great to have a great member back in Deakin. He is a good man. He is working hard for his electorate already. He is very, very concerned about the health needs of the constituents in his electorate. I knew that he had an interest in this electronic health record, or the PCEHR, as it is known.                 I knew that we should try and answer this question in a meaningful way, so I said to my department, 'Let's work out on a percentage basis how many of his constituents can turn up to an emergency department and have their electronic health record accessed on the computer system there.' The first thing, of course, was to establish how many people are in his electorate: 126,672, according to the latest census. But there was a problem. There was a big problem. The department said, 'Minister, we cannot provide you with a percentage figure.' I said: 'Surely it's easy. We now know the population. We want to know how many people can access the computer system in the public hospital when they turn up' - not a big ask, I thought. So I said to the department, 'Please, we have to work harder on this.' They said, 'Minister, it can't be done.' I said, 'Let's apply more resources to it.' In any case, they came back to me and said, 'Minister, the reason that it can't be done is that the former government forgot to talk to the hospitals or the doctors about how these systems should work in the public hospitals,' so the answer of course is that zero, not one, of those 126,000 people who might turn up to the local public hospital in the member for Deakin's electorate can get their record accessed on the computer system within that hospital.                 The level of incompetence knows no bounds when it comes to the Health portfolio during the time of the previous Labor government. The previous minister looks bewildered. She looks bewildered and befuddled. But it is true, Tanya. It is true. You forgot to talk to the doctors and hospitals.                     Of course, Madam Speaker.                     I say to the member for Sydney, who looks befuddled and bewildered: it is true. You did not talk to the doctors.                     To try to provide some enlightenment to the former minister, I will leave her with these facts. They announced the personally-controlled electronic health record three and a half years ago. Eighteen months ago the former minister jumped up and said that the system -                      The system was going live and this was a great time for our country. A billion dollars was spent by the previous government, and 10,000 Australians out of 23 million have a record for which a doctor has uploaded a summary of their health information. Do the maths for a second, and it works out to $100,000 per patient.                     There is shock on this side, but by that side's standard it is not a bad outcome, I suspect.

  Thank you to the member for Lyons for his question. How good it is to have a Liberal back in this House from Tasmania - and not just one, but three. Last week it was terrific to spend a day with the member for Lyons travelling down the Midland Highway. We saw how important it was for Tasmania that this road be upgraded. I can say to the member for Lyons that it is part of the Prime Minister's task to be the infrastructure Prime Minister and we will be upgrading the Midland Highway with $400 million. I am surprised that the one remaining Labor House of Representatives member in this place is opposed to that upgrade, and maybe that is why the people of Tasmania swung so heavily to the coalition in September. We all know that Tasmania is going through economic difficulty and we all know that is being caused by 16 years of bad Labor-Green administration. Hopefully, in March next year the people of Tasmania will change the composition of the Tasmanian parliament, because that state needs the investment; it needs the job creation; it needs to be part of the Roads of the 21st Century, which we will deliver under the stewardship of the infrastructure Prime Minister.                 This is a very important project. The Midland Highway is a major freight and passenger route. It carries over two million tons of freight per year, valued at $2.3 billion and it is forecast to double by 2038 to 4.4 million tonnes. We will deliver these upgrades - $400 million worth of upgrades - as well as our package across the country. The WestConnex in Sydney is a project 30 years overdue. The boss of Bill recently supported the East-West Link in Melbourne with the comment that it is a project that needs to be delivered. The secretary of the AWU made the comment that East-West must be delivered, and, given he has given the instruction to his operator here, he must also back that project.                     Sorry, Madam Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition has close ties to the AWU in Melbourne, and the AWU secretary in Melbourne said the East-West project is a project that must be delivered. Under the infrastructure Prime Minister, it will be delivered. Given the AWU's behind it, the Leader of the Opposition will be behind it and the Labor Party will be behind it. This is part of our agenda to deliver the Roads of the 21st Century under the infrastructure Prime Minister. Vitally important to Tasmania and its people is the package of $400 million for the Midland Highway.

  It is a pleasure to take a question from the member for Robertson - her first question on the day of her first speech. I listened to the speech and reflected on her commitment to her constituents, particularly her view that flexibility in child care is incredibly important for those on the Central Coast who make that long commute to Sydney and for whom Labor's red-tape mess in child care has forced costs up and made much of the child care in Robertson either unavailable or unaffordable. We went to the election with a strong commitment about red tape. We intend to honour that, and we have made a very good start.                 I would like to report to the House that at the education ministers meeting last week I sat down with state and territory ministers and talked about reducing the red tape in child care. Under those opposite, this red tape has been a burden for far too long. Unfortunately, when red tape goes up, common sense goes down. Nobody in the Labor Party is the least bit interested in this, because the Labor Party treats red tape like a security blanket, something to wrap around the work that they do not do, the innovation that they do not support, the services that they do not care about.                   The member for Moreton then left the chamber.                     At the moment under Labor's red tape mess there are 58 elements in the quality standard that centres have to pass in their assessment and rating process. Some centres report that it can take up to 200 days to get a draft report back to the centre. The problem is with the inconsistency of this assessment and rating. Centres email me daily with their experiences - experiences which I have to say are ridiculous.                 Last week I reported to the House on the expenses that centres are facing around the carbon tax. One centre got a 'working towards' rating - which is, let's face it, not very good - because they were too dark, because they turned the lights off for an hour so that the children could recognise Earth Hour. They did not exactly get the best rating that they could. Childcare centres just cannot win under Labor's hypocrisy. Another example is that you cannot administer first aid on school sites if you are not an educator, even if you are the school nurse. That is another example of Labor's completely ridiculous red tape and regulation. Who can forget the birthday cake example, where the member for Adelaide and the member for Sydney talked about the individual cupcakes with an individual candle because they were too worried about germs in childcare centres? What about the sanitising every time you get in and out of the sandpit? There are sanitiser stations sprinkled around the yards.

  Plainly, whoever hands out the questions to members opposite does not have the Leader of the Opposition's best interests at heart, because it was the Leader of the Opposition who first asked for this subject to be reconsidered; it was the Leader of the Opposition who first put this subject on the table. The double standards and the hypocrisy of this opposition and this Leader of the Opposition know no bounds.                     The difference with the coalition is that, when we were in opposition, we fought to make a government keep its commitments. That opposition over there is fighting to break government commitments. That is the difference. We are always prepared to look at integrity measures in our tax system, but we will absolutely honour the commitments that we have made to the Australian people.

  I thank the honourable member for his question and recognise the very keen interest his constituents have in ensuring that the NBN is actually delivered as opposed to being the subject of one misleading press release after another, as it was under the previous government.                 On Tuesday the former chief executive of the NBN Co., Michael Quigley, was asked whether he thought, on reflection, that he should have set targets that were somewhat more conservative, because all of the targets the NBN Co. set were missed. Indeed, by 30 June next year, the NBN Co. will pass with fibre something in the order of 20 per cent of what the previous government had said in its first corporate plan in 2010 would be achieved by that day. So it has been a colossal shortfall. Mr Quigley said: 'You do think, should I have been more conservative? But the timescales are already set for you, the time frames are already put out for you, so there is not much you can do.'                 The previous government forced the NBN to tell the government what it wanted to hear, and there is no worse investment than paying people to tell you what you want to hear. They set unrealistic targets, the company was afraid of telling the truth, and again and again they missed those targets. To the Labor Party, the only thing that mattered was the announcement, the media opportunity, the press release. So again they misled the Australian people. Never forget that, at the time Senator Conroy was telling Australians this was a great investment and mums and dads would line up to invest, they had in their cabinet room a report from Lazard that said the value of the project was a negative $31 billion. It would destroy $31 billion of value.                 We are being thoroughly transparent. Next week we will release the strategic review. We are publishing every week the actual rollout statistics. Instead of fudging and hiding and dissembling, they are being published every single week.                 I have a challenge for the Leader of the Opposition. He says that their government had good reason to embark on the NBN and that it was just a bit of a mishap that things did not go quite as they might have done. There is an opportunity for the transparency from us to be matched by Labor. The Leader of the Opposition can agree to the cabinet papers relating to the formation of the NBN being released. What does the opposition leader have to hide on the NBN? Plenty, I fear.

  I am delighted to be getting so many questions from the opposition today because it certainly makes for a very swift and efficient question time, doesn't it, Madam Speaker? It makes for a very swift and efficient question time. I think there will be a record number of questions answered today.                 Our fundamental commitment was to stop the boats. That was our fundamental commitment. While I would not want to pretend to this parliament that the boats have entirely stopped, they certainly are stopping. Aren't members opposite so embarrassed that their shameful record on border protection is rapidly becoming a thing of the past under this government? This government are cleaning up the border protection disaster and absolute mess that we inherited. Never let it be forgotten the record of members opposite - 55,000 illegal arrivals by boat, $11 billion in border protection blow-outs and, tragically, 1,000 deaths at sea. We stand by all our commitments. We stand by all our policies. Above all else, we stand by the commitment to stop the boats.

  I am very pleased to get a sensible question on education today from the government because I can point out that the government's policy on implementing an independent public schools program across Australia will have a major impact on outcomes and results for students. This side of the House believe that quality and standards should be our watchwords in all things to do with school education.                 In fact, in the Adelaide Advertiser today support came for the coalition's position from a source that we do not normally have in our corner, and that was the South Australian Association of State School Organisations. The director, David Knuckey, said that the Debelle inquiry shows schools cannot depend on the Department for Education and Child Development and that research shows self-governed schools have better outcomes. He went on to say:                 OECD research shows that schools run by the local community are more efficient, have improved financial management, reduced bureaucracy and are more innovative.                 In fact, on the weekend, in a very excellent column in the Weekend Australian written by Kevin Donnelly, he set out much OECD international and domestic research which shows that school autonomy has a major impact on school outcomes for students.                   The member for Chifley then left the chamber.                     I am not surprised that the opposition are so loud and confused about this particular issue. They have been confused about independent public schools from the beginning. The previous prime ministers, Rudd and Gillard, were in favour of independent public schools. The current Leader of the Opposition says independent public schools are privatisation, indicating his fundamental misunderstanding.                 This is not the only issue of confusion for the opposition on school funding. They supported $2.3 billion of cuts to higher education when they were in government. They proposed the cuts ostensibly to pay for the Gonski model for school funding. Then they took $1.2 billion out of the school funding model in the pre-election fiscal outlook. So they not only robbed Peter to pay Paul; they then mugged Paul afterwards in order to get the money from him as well. That is how confused this opposition are. They took the money from Peter to pay Paul and then poor old Paul never got it. They made sure in the pre-election fiscal outlook that they were taking it out of school funding. That is how confused, hopeless and pathetic this opposition are.

  I thank the Treasurer for his question - I mean the shadow Treasurer: he was the Treasurer for much of the time in question. In fact, the foreign investment application in question lay on his desk for months. He says, 'It should have been approved.' He had months to do it and he did not.                     Thank you, Madam Speaker. Let me make it absolutely crystal clear: of 131 significant foreign investment applications, 130 have been approved. By any standard, Australia is open for business. The Minister for the Environment has in the last eight weeks given environmental approval for projects worth $160 billion. By any standard, this country is under new management, it is open for business and the only people who are trying to shut it down are members opposite.

  I thank the member for Solomon for her question. I was very pleased to be able to join her during the recent election campaign and to fund three projects of significance within Solomon that she had been lobbying very hard for. The projects are for three sets of CCTVs that will make her electorate safer.                     This commitment is part of our $50 million Safer Streets policy. This policy is designed to support communities to address crime and antisocial behaviour by funding measures such as CCTV and lighting. This funding will target crime hot spots in local communities, based on the advice that we get from those local communities in conjunction with local policing services.                 Of the $50 million funding for this program, $41 million is coming from the National Crime Prevention Fund and $9 million from proceeds-of-crime money. We made this policy announcement in October 2012 and made very clear where the money would come from. That money had at the time been frozen within the budget. Traditionally, proceeds-of-crime money has funded crime-prevention projects, but the Labor Party in its desperate search for savings said that it was not going to honour what previous governments had done and make sure that proceeds of crime were actually invested in crime-fighting projects. We did not think that that was a smart thing to do. We said that we would take that money and invest it around Australia in projects that the community thinks are important to tackle crime in their local area.                 Subsequently, the Labor Party had a change of heart. They said that they were now going to take that money and invest it in crime-fighting projects through the national crime prevention program. After freezing that money, they made announcements between 7 August and 19 August this year. We had already allocated that funding to our Safer Streets project. The Labor Party made those commitments in the full knowledge that if they lost the election the commitments could not possibly be honoured, because we had allocated that money to the Safer Streets program. They misled - wilfully misled - very good community organisations -                      Madam Speaker, it is very hard to know how to characterise running around Australia telling community organisations something that you know not to be true. Unfortunately, that is what the Labor Party did. As they have done in so many portfolio areas, they have left us with a significant problem.                     We have excellent community organisations who have been expecting funding that the Labor Party knew full well would not be committed if they lost the election. We will deal with this as well as we possibly can.

  The future of the car industry is in the hands of the car industry.                      It is in the hands of the car industry in the same way that it was under Labor. It was February 2008, from memory, when Mitsubishi closed and Labor was in government. It was Ford that announced that it was closing its Australian operation when Labor was in government. Is that a vacuum? Has that gone into the black hole of the six years that never existed? The fact is that, from 2015 onwards, we have committed $1 billion to help the car industry. But, ultimately, the thing that is most going to help the Australian motor vehicle industry is Australians buying their cars. That is what happens. It is about buying Australian cars. I would say to the members opposite: 'Please don't engage in hypocrisy on this. Don't be A-grade hypocrites when it comes to the motor vehicle industry.'                      It was the Labor Party that introduced a fringe benefits tax on motor vehicles - a $1.8 billion hit, which the member for McMahon was so proud of before the election. The best way you can help the Australian motor vehicle industry is impose a $1.8 billion tax on it! That was the Labor way of thinking. Then the Labor Party said that they would have a green car fund and then they cut the green car fund -                      I forgot cash for clunkers. That was another great initiative from the Labor Party. But the carbon tax itself adds to the cost of producing motor vehicles in Australia - a carbon tax manufacturers do not pay if the cars are built in Thailand or anywhere else. The Labor Party believes the best way you can help manufacturing in Australia is to tax it to death. That is the Labor Party way. I would say to the member for Wakefield: the Australian automotive industry survives today despite the Labor Party, and the best thing that could happen for the Australian motor vehicle industry today is for the Labor Party to help get rid of the carbon tax.

  I thank the member for Dawson for his question. The sugar industry is certainly one of Australia's great agricultural industries. Last year, it exported about $1.4 billion worth of product to the world. We are the third largest exporter of sugar and, for that reason, the international competitiveness of the industry is absolutely critical. Australian sugar growers are the only ones in the world that are paying a carbon tax, the only ones in the world that have their cost base increased every day as a result of the carbon tax. Whether they are buying their water or their fuel, whether they are transporting their products to the market - whatever they do - there is a carbon tax built into the cost of their production. In spite of that load that the Labor Party has put on the industry, the industry has sought to grow its export markets around the world.                 The news of the free trade agreement with Korea is particularly important to the Australian sugar industry. Korea is our No. 1 market for sugar exports. The lifting of that tariff immediately upon the implementation of that agreement will be a huge boost to the industry. But, as long as Labor defend their carbon tax, the industry will still have to bear a cost that its competitors anywhere else in the world do not have to bear. On top of that, unlike in other countries, the Labor government imposed the tax on the food-processing sector as well, and that includes, obviously, the crushing industry. It has to meet those sorts of costs as a result of Labor's carbon tax.                 The sugar industry has done remarkably well, but it could do even better if Labor got out of the way and voted to get rid of the carbon tax. They have said they do not want it but they will not vote to take it out of the Australian equation. The best Christmas present that Labor could deliver to the sugar farmers of Australia would be to help to abolish the carbon tax and let them get on with building a profitable sugar industry.

  The incoming Australian government, as the Treasurer has just told the parliament, has put aside substantial amounts of financial support for the Australian car industry. There is still significant financial support available before 2015, when the second $1 billion that the Treasurer referred to kicks into action. We want a strong car industry in Australia. Holden has been very much a part of the Australian way of life for as long as all of us can remember, but Holden also needs to be up-front with its workers and tell them what its intentions are for the Australian car industry.                 The review that we are undertaking will help to plot a future for the industry. It will endeavour to look at ways in which that industry can prosper in the future. But, certainly, it would help the car industry enormously if the carbon tax were to be abolished. By abolishing the carbon tax, you save about $400 on the construction costs of each vehicle, and that would really be something worthwhile.                     If the Labor Party were serious about the objective of having a strong car industry in Australia, they would not have imposed a $1.8 billion fringe benefits tax on the industry. They would not be imposing a carbon tax. They would be getting on with the business of giving the industry the environment in which they can grow and prosper, and that is what this government will do.                     I have finished the answer, Madam Speaker.

  It is a terrific question from the -                      He wrote it! It is a terrific question from the unforgettable member for Wannon; thank you. He cares about our economy and he recognises that, if we actually abolish the carbon tax, we will strengthen the Australian economy - because the previous government's own economic modelling showed that the carbon tax would increase inflation by 0.7 per cent in this year; it would reduce GNI, gross national income, by 0.8 per cent; and, after 10 years, the level of real wages would be 1.1 per cent lower across the country. It is a pretty significant impact.                 Just about every business leader in Australia and a few around the world have said, 'This is just bad policy,' whether it be David Murray, the former head of the Future Fund; Jeanne Pratt, the head of Visy, who just opened a shiny new factory in China - very impressive; or Don Argus, former BHP boss. Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemicals - and he is on President Obama's manufacturing council, not necessarily something that is closely aligned with us - said:                 A carbon price in isolation in the absence of an energy policy is nonsense.                 Also there were John Hannagan from Rusal Australia; John Pegler from the Australian Coal Association; David Peever from Rio Tinto; Marius Kloppers, former head of BHP; Geoff Plummer, Chief Executive, OneSteel, who heavily criticised the carbon tax; the Business Council; David Byers from APIA; Stephen Cartwright from New South Wales Business Chamber; and, Christophe de Margerie, Chairman and Chief Executive, Total, who said:                 The message is that climate change, which is a problem, which is a concern to all of us, cannot be solved by one or two countries even if they are huge countries. Just for Australia trying to sort it out is for me a little bit strange.                 And it went on. The Labor Party said they were going to terminate it. Remember that? Before the election, they were going to terminate the carbon tax. Where have I heard that term 'terminate' before? I thought of Arnie. I did not realise that there had been five films in the Terminator series:No. 1 The Terminator, No. 2 Terminator: Judgment Day, No. 3 Terminator: Rise of the Machines, No. 4 Terminator Salvation and No. 5 'Terminator, the carbon taxbackflip'.

  I thank the member for his question but at this stage we are not working on the pretext that Holden is leaving the country; we are working on the pretext that the industry will continue. If the Labor Party were so concerned about the car industry's future, they would not have sat quietly by while Mitsubishi left the country, while Ford announced that they were leaving the country, while they introduced a $1.8 billion hit -                    Thank you, Madam Speaker. I do not address hypotheticals but I am addressing the issue of the car industry - and the Labor Party has a very poor record when it comes to the car industry. The reality is that those of us on this side are working to give the car industry a future. We have a purposeful, methodical, measured approach to assessing the future of the car industry in Australia. Those who sit opposite just want to politicise the issue; they just want to frighten people about how many jobs might be lost if the chicken crosses the road. We are working on a solution for the car industry and we will continue to do so.

  I compliment the honourable member on her maiden question. It is important that we talk about how we can build better futures for people who live in regional Australia. This government has a very substantial commitment to delivering for regional communities. The honourable member made the obvious point that this government has decided not to honour Labor's election promises made in round 5 of the RDAF. These were promises made in the days leading up to the election and during the election campaign itself and, in some instances, never announced at all.                     The honourable member said they were commitments in the budget. The expenditure was in the budget but certainly the income was not; it was coming out of the mining tax, which did not raise any money. So these were not only election promises; they were also unfunded election promises. The honourable member will, however, be aware that the coalition government did make a lot of substantial promises to the electorate of Indi and we will honour those promises. They were our election promises. We will be delivering the $50,000 for the CCTV cameras in the Alpine Shire, the $5 million for a cardiac catheterisation laboratory in Albury-Wodonga, $150,000 towards a feasibility study for the Bright hospital, $1.4 million for local roads, and a Green Army project in Lake Hume, the Murray River and the Kiewa River. They are just a few of the things we have committed to specifically in Indi. We will also be funding the round 3 RDAF project in the member's electorate, which was not contracted by the previous government.                     It was announced but never contracted. We are anxious to work with people of goodwill to deliver better outcomes to those who live outside the capital cities and our own National Stronger Regions Program will continue that good work into the years ahead. I would expect that next year we will have details of how that program will be operational but in the interim there are around 250 election promises which we have made for specific projects in local regions, which we will be delivering to electorates like Indi and others around the country.

  I understand the member for McPherson is concerned, as is her constituent from Central Engineering, about over-inflated electricity bills - about puffed-up electricity bills - and we are determined to do something about over-inflated electricity bills. Let me make this point: Central Engineering has been hit with a $3,000 impact - on the best advice that we have available - precisely because of the carbon tax, which those on the other side of the chamber say they are opposed to but which those on the other side continue to support through their votes and their actions.                  But Central Engineering is not alone. Central Engineering is one of tens of thousands of small businesses around Australia affected by the carbon tax. The Australian Industry Group has noted that approximately 14½ per cent represents the average increase in energy costs as a result of the carbon tax for their manufacturing businesses.                      It is great to hear from you! You wanted a zero carbon tax. Captain Zero, over there, is back. He wanted a zero carbon tax, but for six months. What a great achievement -                      I respect your admonition. Our good friend over there, the member for Grayndler, when he was vying to be the Leader of the Opposition, wanted a zero carbon tax for six months, when it would go straight back up to $38. That is the great deceit in this debate. The opposition want to change its name, but in every respect it is the same carbon tax with a different name. They took to the election a tax which, according to their own pre-election economic forecast, will hit $38 within five years.                      I want to repeat this: their tax, with a different name, would amount to $38 within five years. That is why the head of Origin Energy wants it gone. That is why the head of Alinta Energy says that they will pass through the entire reduction in electricity prices. That is why the head of AGL has also said that they will pass through all of the electricity costs. That is why the had of the ESAA - the Electricity Supply Association of Australia - has said that they will pass through all of the electricity costs as a result of the abolition of the carbon tax. That is why the head of the ACCC has said that what goes up can come down and will come down - in other words, over-inflated electricity bills will come down. So for Central Engineering there is relief in sight, and that relief will come when the Senate votes to repeal the carbon tax. In the meantime there is a go-slow in the Senate. Stop the go-slow, get out of the way and allow the carbon tax to be removed.

  I am so pleased to get a question from the opposition which is at least a little bit positive. Do we support Holden remaining in Australia? Absolutely. Are we doing something about it? Absolutely. What is the Labor Party doing? They have imposed a carbon tax, which they are now refusing to take off. As the Deputy Prime Minister said, that carbon tax is adding up to $400 per vehicle.                      That is true; and the Labor Party, as they sit in here and behave in this pious fashion, are opposing the removal of that carbon tax in the Senate. If they want to keep Holden here they should take the carbon tax off today.

  Yes, Member for Mitchell, I am very aware of - horrified, in fact, about - that international ranking of how our economy goes compared to other economies in terms of the regulatory burden within which businesses have to try to create wealth and opportunity. Imagine being impeded by a needless, over-arching red-tape and compliance burden that sees us ranked 128th in terms of regulatory imposts in global economies. So many other countries are doing better than us. We have just heard how the carbon tax is acting as a reverse tariff: as lead in the saddlebag of our industries, particularly the car industry. But let us not overlook the incredible burden and the demoralising impact of the way in which regulatory imposts gum up the economy, sap enterprise, and deny us opportunities to grow and prosper. We are starring in that contest, but that is not a contest we want to win. We need to change that. We need to be far more competitive in terms of the regulatory burden we face.                 The Productivity Commission has estimated that about four per cent of our GDP goes to meeting regulatory compliance burdens - four per cent just to meet those imposts! It is anticipated that savings could be of the order of 1½ per cent of our GDP if we could unleash that capacity, where people could invest time and effort in their businesses and enterprises and create opportunities. What an enormous benefit that would be. I am pleased my friend and colleague Josh Frydenberg, the member for Kooyong, is all over this; good luck to him with that work.                 In recent times we have seen a belated recognition from Labor. At a time when it implemented 21,000 new and amended regulatory imposts it also went about ignoring all the advice that was available. It also ignored the rigor that needs to come with deciding to implement a regulatory imposition - those impact statements.                  Did you know, Madam Speaker, that the previous government exempted itself from about 80 examples where a regulatory impact statement should have been implemented but was not and was simply bypassed? One of the ones I find most staggering is in the paid parental leave scheme. The acting opposition leader, amongst her colleagues, said that they would introduce a paid parental leave scheme and make sure there was no administrative complexity for small business. They failed to do that, and then they boasted about the design of their PPL scheme, deliberately incorporating a burden on small businesses. We went twice to this parliament to have a vote to relieve that regulatory burden on small business and let Centrelink's family assistance office make those payments. The very model that Labor boasted about was so successful in its first six months and Labor voted against it twice.                     It accused me of being disruptive: that I was trying to confuse the scheme. In fact, the then minister said it was disappointing we were trying to release small business from that regulatory burden. Well, lo and behold, in the election, what happens? Labor announces the policy, which is exactly -                      the same as the coalition's. Shame on you. You should back our other policy measures and cut the carbon tax as well.

  I thank the member for his question. It seems the peak of arrogance that the members opposite can stand there and claim to be concerned for auto workers in this country at a time when they tax every unit that comes off the production line. They are only pretending to be concerned for the auto industry. If they were concerned for the auto industry they would get behind the government and help us in our work to axe the carbon tax, to axe the mining tax, to cut red tape and to create opportunities for Australian workers. The opposition is all about pretending; they are not about acting in the best interests for auto workers.

  I know the member for Hinkler was not around when they were handing out $900 cheques, but they are still handing out $900 cheques. Five years after the stimulus was called for, nearly nine million $900 cheques went out - and they are still going out. We are going to stop them. What a waste of money. It was the member for Lilley who was the architect of that.                     He must be rather proud of that. I picked up on the weekend, in a report from his favoured journalist -                    The member for Wakefield then left the chamber.                     I picked up on the weekend that the member for Lilley is now writing a book. He said: 'Mr Swan, who remains in the parliament,' - could have fooled me - 'has signed a book deal with publisher Allen &amp; Unwin with a working title Australian Treasurer. Let go, Wayne, let go!                     The architect of the $900 cheques, the member for Lilley, sent 16,000 cheques to stimulate dead people. He sent 27,000 $900 cheques to people overseas, to stimulate the Australian economy. That should be a breakout in the chapter on stimulus.                     I was asked about the waste. I refer to an article from The Age, by Tony Wright. He said that talk-back callers proved a little more reckless with the money:                 Someone called Denise said she'd spend the cash on a new tattoo to match the wolverine job she has on one foot.                  This was from $900 cheque at work. I think that, in the book, there have to be pictures; it cannot be just a lift-out about Denise, whom the member for Lilley should track down -                      We need to have pictures -                      The Tweed Daily News -                      I would refer him to the pictorial. You have to have pictures in a book, and I am sure there will be plenty in that book. I would ask him to take a photo of this:                  Mr Cullen, who took over Number 33 - formerly the Sanctum - at the start of the year, even ran cheeky newspaper advertisements about the stimulus package, encouraging people to 'Get more bang for your buck'.                  He said the economic downturn had certainly taken its toll on the sex industry.                  'It is very quiet at the moment,' Mr Cullen said.                 Thank God for the $900 cheques!                 'The stimulus package helped a bit. Around the time the money started to come in business picked up.'                 The problem is that it is taxpayers' money that went out: $900 cheques - borrowed money from the next generation - that the member for Lilley and the Labor Party just splashed around without regard. It is only the coalition that is going to stop the waste. It is only the coalition that is going to stop the mismanagement. What a disgrace from Labor.

  We heard in question time today about the 200,000 jobs that Labor lost while it was in office. There were 200,000 people added to the unemployment queue because of Labor's policies. When it comes to, say, the car industry, Labor gave Ford $34 million saying that it would create 300 extra jobs, but eight months later 330 employees lost their jobs. That was the effectiveness of Labor's policy. They gave $215 million to Holden, saying it would secure their future in Australia until 2022, but within months 670 jobs were lost.                 The reality is that Labor's inconsistent and incoherent industry policies were a constant threat to the jobs of Australian workers during their entire time in office. What we are proposing for Australia is a different direction: a country that is governed logically and sensibly; that deals carefully with the decision-making processes; that has plans to deliver a stable environment so that people will want to invest in this country - a country free of carbon taxes and mining taxes which have led overseas investors to say that this is not a country where you can invest with any degree of security.                 By providing the kind of environment that rewards investment and rewards achievement we will encourage Australian businesses and Australian industry to employ more Australians. That is our commitment - the commitment we made at the time of the election and the commitment we intend to deliver.

  I can inform the member for Forrest that, unfortunately for the Higher Education Support Act, the bill is stuck in the Senate while Labor and the Greens continue to refuse to pass it. We are in the ludicrous position in the current parliament where Labor are now voting against the savings measures they proposed whilst in government. They are also voting against increasing the debt ceiling limit. So we have the ridiculous situation where Labor had savings measures that they now oppose. They are adding to the debt limit, they are adding to the deficit and they are voting against the bill to increase the debt ceiling limit. That is how economically illiterate Labor have become.                 I notice that Paul Keating the former Prime Minister is in Canberra this week to talk to the caucus about economic matters. I am sure he would have some advice for them, because Labor are tremendously confused at the moment. They are very confused economically. They want to have their cake and they want to eat it too. They want to add to the debt, they want to add to the deficit, they want to vote against savings measures they proposed, and they want to also vote against increasing the debt ceiling limit bill.                 We have the ridiculous situation where Labor not only are opposing our program and frustrating the abolition of the carbon tax and the mining tax and savings measures but also voting against their own program when they were in office. No wonder Labor voters are confused. First they are told that Kevin Rudd is the Messiah; then he is the monster. Then they are told, three years later, that Julia Gillard is the Messiah; then they are told that Julia Gillard is not the Messiah but a liability, and they have to go back to the monster.                     I will, Madam Speaker, and I am trying to explain so that it is easy for the opposition to see how confusing their position is on the debt ceiling limit bill and on the savings measures that they proposed and that they now oppose. This is but a piece of Labor over the last six years. They are so bad economically and so juvenile economically that they are now making the flat-earth Greens look economically literate. I am hoping that Paul Keating this week might be able to give them some good advice, because Paul Keating was a member of a government - the Hawke government - which actually made a difference to the economy in this country. They would never have proposed the savings measures and then opposed those same savings measures. They would never have said that the debt ceiling limit should not be raised but then voted against measures that would reduce Commonwealth debt. When Mr Keating comes I look forward to his pearls of wisdom informing the Labor caucus about how to be a legitimate and economically literate opposition.

  The 27 people whom the shadow minister referred to are very lucky to be alive. They could have met a far worse fate, because the warning that is there to people who are thinking of getting on boats on the eve of the monsoon is this: there is no big safety net waiting on the other side. They are very fortunate that they did not encounter a fate far worse than the one that they found.                 I note those opposite have sought to draw attention to this matter. They must have collective amnesia about the previous six years. If they want to understand what failure looks like, it looks like this: over 50,000 arrivals; over 1,100 people dead; over 15,000 people who were given permanent visas, denying those who are waiting offshore. That is what failure looks like. That is not a failure this government is going to repeat, because this government is putting in place the measures that have led to a more than 80 per cent reduction in illegal arrivals to Australia by boat since that operation was put in place. Those opposite do not like to hear that figure, particularly the Don Bradman of border failure, the Manager of Opposition Business, because he holds the record for the highest level of illegal arrivals by boat of any immigration minister in our history. He even surpassed the member for Gorton and the member for McMahon. The member for McMahon was a steady performer on failure - I will give him that - but he never was able to meet the heights that the Manager of Opposition Business was able to reach.                     I go back to the incident which we reported on Thursday evening. I took the opportunity to personally brief the shadow minister that night. I am surprised that, when he would have been of the understanding that nine people were still missing and there was a search operation underway, he chose to go out and make political mileage out of this issue on that morning. But, for those who want to think about what the previous government did, I remember not just the Geraldton incident -                      I note the interjection from Labor's people's choice for opposition leader over there, but I can tell you what the people did not choose: a continuation of the border failures we saw on the previous government's watch. They hit a high note when, I recall on one occasion, a vessel came into Flying Fish Cove and, instead of doing what this government did, which is have an incident assessment done for something like this, they announced that the vessel had been intercepted - by the wharf!

  I thank the member for Barker for his question. I congratulate him on his first speech, in which he demonstrated what a passionate advocate he will be for his electorate. I can confirm to him that the Australia-Korea free trade agreement that was announced on Friday is undeniably good news, not only for agricultural producers in his electorate but also across Australia. It is going to help grow our economy, it will provide certainty for investors and it will certainly create an environment for more jobs in Australia. This Korea-Australia free trade agreement will lift key tariffs off key agricultural products. Some Korean tariffs are as high as 300 per cent and we will see a number of them reduced to zero on key agricultural products, particularly beef. Beef producers were estimated to be losing $1.4 billion because the agreement was stalled under Labor. Tariffs also go to zero on wine, wheat, canola oil, seafood, tomatoes, grapes and others.                 I point out that the Australian government has now delivered on an election promise to complete this agreement. Within 100 days of coming to office, we have concluded this agreement - something that the Labor Party could never do. We were able to make a pragmatic decision and put aside Labor ideology. We put the interests of the exporters and producers first. I congratulate the Minister for Trade and Investment, Andrew Robb, on an outstanding job in concluding a comprehensive, high-quality agreement with our third-largest export partner, our fourth-largest trading partner. It is a quality agreement, not only in agriculture but also in resources and energy and manufacturing. It creates a new market for services. In fact, this is the best free trade agreement that we have concluded in relation to market access for services - an outstanding outcome. It is also reducing investment barriers.                     So this free trade agreement, which was concluded by Minister Robb and which could never have been concluded by those opposite because of their ideological barrier, will create more jobs and grow our economy. It is an outstanding win for an Australian minister, it is an outstanding win for the Australian government and, most of all, it is a win for the Australian people. This will create jobs. I congratulate Minister Robb.                     No, it was a point of order.                     It was a request to table a document to which he was referring.

  I would have to check the record, but that vessel that came to Geraldton on that day probably would have been vessel 750 something, I suspect, at that time. It came to the mainland of Australia, not to Christmas Island. It was sponsored by Deutsche Bank, I think, from memory!                   The member for Moreton then left the chamber.                     To assist the member: in October, November and so far in December there have been 14 boats that have arrived including the one where 27 people were very fortunate to get ashore and not perish at sea last Monday evening. During the same period last year under the former government's policies, 97 vessels turned up in the same period. I know that those opposite are very sensitive on this point. I welcome the fact that they wish to come in here on multiple occasions and ask questions about these matters. I am happy to answer because their record speaks plainly for itself - that is, they have the worst record of border failure of any government in our history. The Australian people voted for a change, and they are getting that change: there has been an 80 per cent reduction in illegal arrivals to Australia by boat since operation sovereign borders.                 I notice that the manager of opposition business continues to protest. But the facts speak for themselves - he was the biggest failure on our borders in our nation's history.

  Thank you, Madam Speaker. I cannot help being passionate around you! I thank the member for Mallee for his question. The member for Mallee comes from an area where one of the great products amongst many around Mildura is potatoes: spuds. There was about a 303 per cent tariff on spuds into Korea before the coalition came in. The coalition were instrumental in reducing those tariffs. I think we should start this answer by basically ticking the boxes of the things we have done in the first 100 days.                 When we arrived there was no farm finance agreement; but there is now, so we can tick that box. When we arrived there was no free trade agreement with Korea; but we have that now, so we can tick that box. When we arrived the former government had destroyed the live cattle trade; but we fixed that up, so we can tick that box. But it is not just what we have done in the first 100 days; it is our plan for future decades. This white paper is so important because, if our nation is to be a nation with many strings to its bow, then we must have a strong agricultural sector. If we live with mining, then we are going to live in a boom-bust cycle. If we deliver services, then we are just one click away on the internet from competition at probably a lower wage rate and, in many instances, a lower standard of education. But in agriculture we have a great strategic advantage to pursue.                 This paper will have three stages. The first stage, the issues section, is where we right now are collecting all the ideas and are out there giving the Australian people the opportunity to contribute. The next section is the green paper, where we have a range of alternatives. The final stage, the white paper, is where we can select those alternatives. This gives the Australian people a sense that we will be part of an Asian future. We will be delivering an outcome, and we will be getting a better return to the farm gate because we have a proven track record in the past and we have a proven track record for the future.                 I am looking forward to working with my counterpart on the other side. He wrote a very good media release today. He was getting stuck into me a little bit, but I am willing to work. I am looking forward to explaining to the Australian people how we have a great future in agriculture under a coalition government.

  I thank the member for Grayndler for his question. It is a good question. We are committed to being the infrastructure government, led by the infrastructure Prime Minister. We will spend many billions of dollars improving productivity, particularly in my home state of South Australia, which has one of the worst economies in Australia. It has had the despicable combination of 12 years of a very bad state government under Labor and six years of a very bad federal government under Labor.                     Audition No. 5, Anthony! How many Managers of Opposition Business are there?                     I was overruled. Burkey, that is what you are meant to do when he gets up every time: overrule him. You are the leader, mate. Take responsibility.                     It was nice to hear from the member for Chifley arguing against the WestConnex proposal in Sydney today - extraordinary! What I can say is that the coalition at the election were very clear about our policy, and the people chose us.

  I very much thank the member for Reid for his question. He is particularly interested in getting better services for the people of Reid. I have been able to detail some of the achievements of the former health minister - or, rather, the Acting Leader of the Opposition, with all the qualities of Julia Gillard sitting in that chair. She is fully behind the leader She is fully behind Bill Shorten - just like Julia Gillard was behind Kevin Rudd! Remember him?                     A fair point of order, Madam Speaker. The member rightly points out that in his electorate he has 95,000 people who hold private health insurance. Bear in mind that the member for Sydney, the former health minister, claimed that it was a great day for the country - the rollout of the personally controlled electronic health record, referred to affectionately as the PCEHR.                 When you consider that 95,000 people within just the electorate of Reid have private health insurance, you would have thought that one of the achievements of the member for Sydney would have been that private health insurance patients, when they went into a hospital, could have had their record accessed and updated in that private hospital. We know that around 40 per cent of hospital patients are treated in private hospitals. And yet I explained to the House last week that, in the formation of the personally controlled electronic health record, the previous government forgot to speak to doctors and public hospitals about this record. But now it turns out that they forgot to speak to private hospitals. I will ask for the help of my colleagues here: you would have thought that, of 95,000 people, what - 50,000?                     No! Let us say 20,000 of the 95,000 -                      Do you think 20,000?                     No! They are too generous; not even 10,000, not even a thousand, not a hundred, not one - not one patient! Unbelievable! Do you know that this former government, this former minister who wants to be the Leader of the Opposition, spent $1 billion on the personally controlled electronic health record. About 10,000 Australians had a record uploaded by their doctor. But we know that people who go into emergency departments and people who go into private hospitals cannot have their record accessed, in many cases, except in, out of the 150 electorates, just one electorate -                      Now my colleagues ask, 'Which electorate?' It was one electorate: the electorate of Sydney. But they did not get around to the other 149.

  I take it from the question that the opposition does not support the views of the United States, Japan, the Philippines, the European Union, Canada and others, who have all raised their concerns, along with Australia, about the announcement without warning or consultation -                      So I take it from the question that the opposition have walked away from their position that we would have concerns about any unilateral action or any action taken without warning or consultation in relation to the East China Sea. That was the position of the Labor Party when they were in government. What the coalition have done is restate our concerns over action taken by China that has in fact regrettably led to consequential steps taken by other countries. South Korea has now announced an air defence identification zone in retaliation. This is a concern and all parliamentarians should join with the government in ensuring that we make our concerns known. We are not afraid to stand up for our values and our interests. We are not afraid to state Australian foreign policy even if it does not agree with the outlook of some of our friends and partners. We are proud of the position we have taken. We do not resile from it.                 Perhaps I could remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition what one would not do in relation to the China relationship, as set out in David Marr's 'Power Trip' article in the Quarterly Essay of June 2010. I remind the deputy leader that the man she chose to be Prime Minister over Prime Minister Gillard referred to the Chinese in less than flattering terms in an article that sets out precisely what former Prime Minister Rudd said about the Chinese interlocutors at the Copenhagen climate change conference.                 I remind the shadow minister that the relationship that we inherited had a number of deep concerns. I had a four-hour meeting with Foreign Minister Wang Yi and at the end of that meeting we restated our commitment to the strategic partnership. I am looking forward to the visit of Prime Minister Abbott to Beijing next year. The strategic partnership is strong and firm, but that does not mean that we agree with every point of difference raised by the Chinese nor with any other of our friends and partners. I table this document to remind the shadow minister of the way the Labor Party dealt with China. The 2009 white paper caused enormous challenges -

  I thank the honourable member for his question because I know that there is considerable anxiety within the motor vehicle manufacturing industry about the future of General Motors in Australia. The comment made this morning by Mr Devereux, the general manager, that no decision has been made at this point just adds to the uncertainty. What this government have said is that we want a clear commitment that General Motors will remain active in Australia. The statements today include no clear commitment to stay in manufacturing in this country, yet it was only two years ago when Holden said it had achieved 'sustained profitability in Australia'. So just two years ago the company was reporting sustainable profitability and now it has not ruled out abandoning manufacturing in this country.                 This government are doing their part to endeavour to create a better atmosphere for manufacturing in Australia. As far as the motor vehicle industry is concerned, we have got rid of the $1.8 billion changes to the fringe benefits tax which were going to have such an enormous impact on the motor vehicle manufacturing industry. Of course, we have legislation in the parliament to get rid of the carbon tax, which adds to the cost of every vehicle made in this country.                 Holden is an Australian icon, and we want to have a nation where companies such as Holden can prosper and achieve their objectives in manufacturing. So today I have written to the general manager of Holden, Mr Devereux, asking General Motors to make an immediate statement clarifying their intentions in this country. They owe this to the workers of General Motors. Let us not go into the Christmas period without General Motors making a clear commitment to manufacturing in this country and responding to this government's endeavours to improve the manufacturing environment in Australia.                 The government is committed to making Australia a place where manufacturing can prosper and where we can work together as a society, as a community and as an economy, not to just allow manufacturing jobs to drift away as they did under the previous regime, but instead to work together to find ways to make sure that manufacturing continues to employ people in this country and that we have a strong and robust manufacturing industry for future generations of Australians.

  The best return on investment that you can have is for a business to invest its own money, make its own profits and remain sustainable. That is the best return of investment you can have. It is a foreign concept to the Labor Party. I was looking at the frontbench yesterday, and I was wondering: who has ever worked in the private sector in the Labor Party?                     Two - two people have!                     Three - come on, Joel, don't embellish it! Sorry, it is three. On the whole frontbench of the Labor Party, three people have ever worked in the private sector. How many have worked in the private sector in the coalition?                     There you go - we know what return on investment looks like. Return on investment comes about by doing the hard yards; by having a government that can accommodate investment and risk and that does not look at someone who is profitable and say, 'I want that,' which is what Labor does. Labor does not ever witness a profit that it does not want to take off a hardworking employer or a hardworking employee.                 As the Deputy Prime Minister said, 'we want to have a strong manufacturing industry in Australia'. But we have inherited an economy where one job in manufacturing was lost every 19 minutes under Labor. Under Labor, Ford closed their doors and Mitsubishi closed their doors. How about that? Talk about return on investment! That is what you judge to be a good return on investment, is it? Labor's answer to everything is just to throw more money at it. Their response is always to put their political interests ahead of the commercial interests of individual companies.                 So I would say to the Leader of the Opposition: put Australia first, put the workers first and join with the Acting Prime Minister and the government in calling on Holden to come clean with the Australian people about their intentions here. We want them to be honest about it - we want them to be fair dinkum - because, if I was running a business and I was committed to that business in Australia, I would not be saying that I have not made any decision about Australia. Either you are here or you are not.

  I am aware of the news that the Wilkie Creek coalmine, in the member's electorate, is to close. It is an electorate where drought has affected agricultural production and where there have been a number of other setbacks over recent years. To lose these 120 jobs just a couple of weeks before Christmas is very bad news indeed.                 The reality is that these are some of many jobs which were lost in the mining industry over the term of the previous government. In fact, if you go to the ABS statistics of August this year, you will see that they confirm that, since May 2012, 7,100 jobs have been lost in the mining sector - 7,100 jobs have been lost in the mining sector alone.                 As the honourable member mentioned, when commenting on the closure Peabody referred to the carbon tax. They acknowledged other things that affected their profitability, but they said that the carbon tax 'represents a substantial burden on an export-driven mine'. This comes after Origin Energy's managing director also expressed concerns yesterday about the imposition of this damaging tax. The reality is that the carbon tax destroys jobs; it takes jobs away, particularly in the mining sector.                 This should not come as any surprise to the Labor Party, who introduced this tax. It was the objective of the Labor Party to close coalmines. That was one of the purposes of the carbon tax. The Greens rejoice every time there is a lost job in the coalmining industry.                 The reality is that this is a part of Labor's mess which we must now work to fix up. The government have been active in getting new projects moving forward. More than 100 significant projects, worth hundreds of billions of dollars, have been approved by this government since we came into office, and many of those are in the resources sector. So it is possible to approve these projects and get them moving again, but many of them will falter while the carbon tax is still in place. If members opposite want jobs created they can start by approving the abolition of the carbon tax forthwith. If they are serious about jobs, they will get rid of the carbon tax and encourage employers to invest in this country and create those jobs.

  No. The only future-killers in this building are the Labor Party. Let me give you some facts. The net combined assistance to the automotive manufacturing industry in 2011 was $1.1 billion of taxpayers' money - $1.1 billion in one year. The average assistance per manufacturing employee is $48,000 of taxpayers' money.                 We have put another billion dollars on the table, from 2015. A hell of a lot of industries in Australia would love to get the assistance the automotive industry is getting. A hell of a lot of other businesses, and foreign owned businesses, would love to be able to remit money from Australian taxpayers to head office in Detroit, London, Tokyo or anywhere else. There is no shortage of money that has been going to the motor manufacturing industry. If all those assistance measures have worked so well in the past, why have Ford and Mitsubishi left Australia? If all that money has made a difference, why have two of the four major manufacturers left Australia? And why are we in a position today where the third manufacturer, Holden, is refusing to confirm it is around for the long term, even though there is an additional $1 billion on the table? I will tell you why. It is because the Labor Party has made it so damn hard to make anything in Australia. Labour costs are one great example.                 If you really care about the motor vehicle industry, I say to the Labor Party: ring up your good mates at the AMWU and tell them to recommend to the workers at Toyota that they should accept the deal offered by Toyota on Friday. This is where the rubber hits the road. Toyota has an additional cost for manufacturing in Australia of $2,800 per vehicle. They have gone to their employees and said, 'We need to have this deal go through to help to manage - just to manage - the cost of employment in Australia so that we can go back to Tokyo and say to them in good faith that the workers of Australia really do want a manufacturing business.' So the best thing the Labor Party can do is put aside the politics and ring up its mates at the AMWU and tell them to accept the deal being offered by Toyota, which will give them job security.

  If the honourable member for Melbourne really cared about the budget, and I am hoping that he does, but he was in a partnership with the Labor Party whilst in government -                      Listen mate, you were the one who went up to the altar with him!                     The fact of the matter is that the Greens and the Labor Party have formed a partnership in the Senate to block $20 billion of savings. They are not savings we have announced since the election. There are $15 billion in savings we took to the last election and there are $5 billion in savings the Labor Party took to the last election, and the Labor Party is now opposing them. So the Labor Party and the Greens are opposing their own savings, which would improve the bottom line and reduce government debt. The Labor Party and the Greens are so appalled at the state of the budget that they are going to oppose everything we are trying to do to fix it. I tell you what: they are hypocrites writ large.                 So I say to the member for Melbourne: if you really care about the budget, back what the coalition is doing. And if you do not have it in you to back what the coalition is doing, back what the Labor Party promised at the last election, because not even the Labor Party has the guts to stand by what they promised the Australian people at the last election when it comes to fixing the budget.

  There you have it: for a Labor Party that might be remotely interested in jobs, there is evidence of the impact of your job-destroying carbon tax. It backs up all the other case studies that have been brought to this chamber and shared with Labor time and time again, case studies of how the carbon tax that you promised not to implement but went ahead and implemented has cost jobs in the Australian small business community. But you did not want to know about. There are 412,000 Australians now not employed in small business -                      This is continuing evidence of their indifference to the economic plight of small business in this country. Here is a case study of the cost burdens that the carbon tax that you promised not to introduce has had on Australian small businesses. You went around saying -                      The Labor Party went around saying -                      Madam Speaker, you know that 412,000 jobs were lost in small business under Labor and you know the impact that the carbon tax has had. You know that small business is asked about Labor's contribution to the success of their enterprise; and the Sensis Business Index time and time again identifies that small businesses view Labor's contribution as being negative to their economic prospects. Here they go: you do not want to hear about it, do you, Albo?                      There is the evidence for the indifference Labor has to the women and of small business.                 We have seen in the most recent Sensis survey a 62 per cent positive turnaround in the sentiment of small business towards Commonwealth government policies. What do they talk about? They say: 'Support amongst SMEs for the federal government improved dramatically following the recent federal election, bringing this indicator to the highest point it's been since November 2007.' They go on to describe this as a turnaround of 62 percentage points following the federal election. The reason for that is that the coalition took a small business policy to the electorate. The coalition bothered to engage with the men and women of small business. At the heart of that agenda was the abolition of the carbon tax.                 You have heard from Mr Parsons at Little Creek Cheese. We have heard of examples right across the place. Why don't you just sit down?                     Here we have at the heart of our policy the abolition of the carbon tax. All the Abbott government wants to do is get on and implement its policies. What a novel idea that would be after Labor came to office promising not to do something and then went ahead and did it. What we say to Mr Parsons and all of those small business men and women is this: we are on your side; we are your best advocates; we will not rest until we get rid of this carbon tax - the carbon tax that Labor promised not to introduce and then went ahead and introduced that contributed to the loss of 412,000 jobs in small business. Shame on you, Labor. At least get out of the road so we can get on with our job.

  I thank the member for Capricornia and the work she has been doing with the dairy farmers at Port Curtis. I let the dairy farmers know of the correspondence has come to my office by reason of the member for Capricornia. She is a diligent and hard worker for that area. But of course the dairy farmers of Capricornia have a range of issues that they need to deal with - and I commend the work that the Minister for Small Business, Bruce Billson, is doing to make sure they are treated fairly as well. One of the things we can change is the excessive costs that they are having to deal with. If we go through the life of a dairy farmer: with a dairy farmer, if it is steel posts, they have to pay the carbon tax on those - or the steel mill does, if the steel mill is in Australia; if the steel mill is supporting Australian working families, they have to pay the carbon tax. But, of course, if the steel comes in from overseas, they do not pay the carbon tax. They have to pay the carbon tax on the wire, if it is from Australia, if it is supporting Australian working families; but, if it comes in from overseas, they do not pay the carbon tax.                 In the shed, they have to pay the carbon tax when the electricity is going, so it is going to cost more to milk. And then when it gets to the processor, did you know that down south at Murray-Goulburn they paid $14 million in carbon tax in 2013? This is the sort of cost involved.                 Even when you get to the end of the cow's life, and they take it to the abattoir, which supports Australian working families - who, you would think, would be supported by the Australian Labor Party, but they are not: they want to move Australian jobs overseas, and they have been doing a very good job of it - they pay the carbon tax. If you emit 24,999 tonnes of carbon, you do not pay the carbon tax. But if you emit 25,000 tonnes of carbon at that abattoir - like you would at Casino, to the south of you, member for Capricornia - then you do pay the carbon tax, at $24.15 per tonne. In fact, that beast that goes through and triggers the 25,000 tonnes at $24.15 is a $603,000 beast! And where would a lunatic policy like that come from? From the Australian Labor Party! Why don't you stand up for Australian working families - get rid of the carbon tax, stop wrestling with your mates in the Greens and look after Australian working families.

  I thank the member for Pearce for his question and I congratulate him on his outstanding maiden speech. He is absolutely right: there are obstacles. The biggest obstacle is the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party is now blocking $20 billion of savings that would improve the budget bottom line and reduce Labor's legacy of debt.                 What is surprising - and it would be surprising to most - is that Labor are now opposing their own savings. The latest one came just last night - a $1.1 billion change to research and development tax changes. On 17 February this year Julia Gillard announced that she was changing research and development tax changes to save $1.1 billion to pay for a plan for Australian jobs. She went on to say: 'This is going to actually be a benefit to the Australian economy and obviously the budget.' Last night in the House the shadow assistant Treasurer stood up and said they would not support those cuts they announced in February.                 Then the Labor Party announced on 13 April this year - only a little bit after April Fool's Day - $2.3 billion in savings from cuts in higher education to pay for their Gonski education reforms. And then Senator Kim Carr - Kim il Carr - said that they will not -                      I withdraw. It was so offensive! The $2.3 billion that the Labor Party announced to pay for Gonski, they are now opposing. They still want us to deliver their election promise to spend the money, but they do not want us to deliver their election promise to save the money. And then of course there was the $1.5 billion in the reversal of tax cuts that Labor promised as compensation for the carbon tax they were going to terminate.                 So, on one hand Labor is saying, 'You should be more responsible with the budget' and on the other hand they are opposing everything we are doing to get the budget bottom line back in shape. And the Labor Party is now opposing everything they were doing to get the budget bottom line back in shape. There is a little message here: if you want to be a credible opposition you have to have some core principles. I know the Labor Party had no consistent core principles in government. But give it a shot in opposition, because hopefully you will be there a long time.

  I congratulate the member for Moore on his outstanding maiden speech yesterday as well.                 I will release the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook next Tuesday at the Press Club, and I will there lay down before the Australian people, in all of its detail, the state of the budget that we have inherited from Labor and the state of the economy that we have inherited from Labor. That will illustrate to the Australian people that that government was the most reckless government in modern Australian history. It was a government with absolute disregard for Australian taxpayers' money. And the waste - the entrenched waste that was part and parcel of six years of the worst government of Australian history - is going to be revealed in all of its graphic detail. The outlook will also have the appropriate forecasts for the Australian economy. And it will show, based on the September national accounts, the fact that at the moment the Australian economy is locked in below trend growth.                 We have rising unemployment. We have falling terms of trade. There is no act of self-delusion as existed under Labor, but we have a plan. We have a plan to get it back. We have a plan to fix the budget. We have a plan to start living within our means. We have a plan to grow the economy. We have a plan that focuses on getting rid of the carbon tax, getting rid of the mining tax, rolling out an agenda for infrastructure that helps to stimulate job growth. We have a plan that gets the balance right in relation to workplace relations, bringing back the Australian Building and Construction Commission, with all of its powers and resources, to stand up to the thuggery of the mates of the Labor Party. We have a plan that focuses on building the infrastructure that is going to drive a stronger economy: better competition laws, a better financial services regime. We have a plan that needs to be rolled out - and it is not just that it can be rolled out; it must be rolled out. When I reveal the mid-year budget numbers next Tuesday - no matter how bad they are, no matter how alarming they will be - I will say emphatically to the Australian people, there is only one way to fix it: give the coalition a free hand to fix the budget, give the coalition a free hand to fix the economy and get the Labor Party and their mates in the Greens out of the way so that we can get our legislative program through the Senate.

  These WA projects are important, and the North West Coastal Highway is an important project. The Deputy Prime Minister has made that point too. But you funded it, member for Grayndler, from a tax that did not earn any revenue - the mining tax. So, all I would say to the member for Grayndler is: stay tuned.

  I am pleased to table my ministerial review of the Early Years Quality Fund - another sad chapter in Labor's narrative of union distortion and slush funds. The independent review has found that the Early Years Quality Fund was deeply flawed, deeply unfair and a front to boost union membership. Now, I want to make it very clear that we will honour our election commitments. We will pay the contracted funds. I have told the 16 service providers exactly that. However, I have invited them to participate in the coalition's professional development fund - a better way that looks after every educator, every centre and every child. It does what Labor's flawed fund could never achieve: it lifts the quality standards in the sector as a whole.                 We know that Labor looks after their union mates, because that is just what they do. We know that every member of the Labor Party in this place owes their existence to a union. But never before has $300 million of taxpayers money being used in the pursuit of this disgraceful aim. It was dangled as a bribe in front of every childcare worker by the member for Adelaide in her position as minister at the time. Union members invaded the lunch rooms of workplaces across this country, insisting on signups. 'Sign up, because if you do, you'll get the money. Sign up, because, without being a member of our union, you won't have an opportunity to participate in this fund.' This was the minister at the time, desperately scrambling in the week before the election to sign these contracts. Why did she leave this fund open so long? Why didn't she administer it properly? You know why, Madam Speaker. Because every second it was open there was more opportunity for union sign-ups. There was more opportunity for members to be tricked into joining the union. This minister sat by and let it happen.                 When the union that I talk about came to see me about 18 months ago, I said, 'Why not take this case to the Fair Work Commission, the independently constituted body that deals with wages, created by Julia Gillard.' Do you know why they did not to it? It was because they needed this process to sign up more union members. Members of the Labor Party and ministers in position at that time allowed this to happen, and they did not even have the decency to put a message on the website to say that the fund was exhausted in just 12 hours. And what should make us feel really sick is that this was never about the early years, this was never about quality, this was never about educators, this was never about the children. This was only ever about the union. Shame, Labor, shame!

  I thank the member for Grayndler for the question, and we hope today that the member for Grayndler will support our Infrastructure Australia bills which are in the parliament. They will strengthen the independence of that body to ensure that a stronger outcome for infrastructure is achieved by the infrastructure government led by the infrastructure Prime Minister. Urban rail projects are important, and we believe the state -                      You have had your go, Albo.                     Yes, endorsement from you is okay, Tania, I do not mind that.

They are very substantial projects.                     They are substantial projects, and the state government should invest in them.

  I can inform the member for Eden-Monaro that the government is progressing the Registered Organisations Commission bill, but not with the support of the opposition, unfortunately. It is surprising, and unfortunately I have to report back to the parliament that Labor is not supporting the protection of workers' dues under the Registered Organisations Commission. There is almost nothing worse than stealing from low-paid workers to fund living high on the hog for union bosses - almost nothing worse. What we have seen over the last few years is example after example of some unions and some union bosses deliberately setting up organisations or structures that steal from the workers that they are supposed to represent. I think the worst example has been the Health Services Union in recent times, where the former president of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Williamson, pleaded guilty to four very serious charges of defrauding his members by $1 million. And, of course, the former Labor member for Dobell is in the courts right now defending charges that he defrauded members of the Health Services Union.                 I know that there are very good members on the other side of the House, and this side of the House, who are as appalled as I am by the behaviour of Mr Williamson, the alleged behaviour of Mr Thomson -                      Unfortunately, it goes to the sensitivity of the new member for Newcastle that he would be seeking to interrupt a very serious answer about a very serious issue. There are good people on the Labor side from the union bosses, from the union party, who do recognise that stealing from workers is the worst crime of all. We have seen it with the Health Services Union, the Transport Workers Union, the CFMEU and the National Union of Workers. All of their slush funds have been under a cloud - IR21, Industry 2020, Building Industry 2000.                 All of these organisations' slush funds, examples of stealing from the workers that the union bosses are meant to represent, would be dealt with by the Registered Organisations Commission. The Registered Organisations Commission would stand up for workers. What this proves to me is that, yet again, it is the Liberal and National Parties that are the friends of the workers. It is the Liberal and National Parties that seek to protect the workers against rapacious union bosses who steal their money and use it to live high on the hog, and I am proud to be part of a party that genuinely stands up for workers - that does not just use them to win preselection and to get elected.

  Is that right, Member for Lilley - all the correspondence between the member for Lilley and the Reserve Bank has now been released? Is that right? Just nod your head. Has he released all the correspondence where the member for Lilley certified to the Reserve Bank that he would not take a dividend out of the Reserve Bank? Then he went and took a dividend of $500 million out of the Reserve Bank. Has he released that correspondence? Has he released all that correspondence - because, I tell you what, you have been caught out on this -                      I am happy to finish it, because I was asked about the Reserve Bank. I would say to the member for Lilley, as I say to all members over there: there are two things that they need to know about this issue -                      What was that?                     There are two issues that need to be addressed. No. 1: the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund never went below 10 per cent when we were in government. That is my best recollection of it: we never went below. And we had consistent dividends taken out of the Reserve Bank during that time. Then, again from memory, in 2008-09, the then Treasurer took $5½ billion out of the Reserve Bank -                      When the previous Treasurer, the member for Lilley, took $5½ billion as a special dividend out of the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund, the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund, which is a contingency fund set off against the riskiest assets of the Reserve Bank, fell to 3.8 per cent. In the interim, the member for Lilley, concerned about going to 3.8 per cent, gave a pledge to the Reserve Bank that he would take no more dividends; he would allow them to replenish the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund. Then, in his desperation to deliver a surplus, which of course Labor never delivered - and, I tell you what, he talks about telling porkies: he made 300 promises to deliver a surplus and not one of them was delivered - he took half a billion dollars out of the Reserve Bank.                 I flagged in February this year that I was concerned about the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund. I raised it publicly. One of the first things I did was contact the Governor of the Reserve Bank and the Secretary to the Treasury and say to them, 'Do you have all the resources you need to deal with any challenges that might emerge over the next few years?' They came back and said they wanted 15 per cent in the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund, $8.8 billion. Contrary to what the L-plate treasurer over there does not understand, the $8.8 billion is a grant within government. If he has not worked out that it comes back with dividends then he should not be there.                 Leave granted.

  It is a pleasure to take a question from the member for Fisher, a previous childcare minister in this place, who would be horrified, after reading the report that I have just tabled in question time, at the behaviour of the Labor Party with respect to the hardworking educators of this country.                 We have a better plan and, importantly, I want to mention some aspects of our plan. Our plan is to professionally develop the entire childcare sector and to use the funds that Labor had allocated to its slush fund in order to do exactly that. It is really important that we recognise that $30 million of our professional development fund will be allocated to vulnerable and disadvantaged children, children who are struggling to get a start in Australia today. I am proud of that.                 But we do need to remind ourselves of some of the behaviour of unions in the creation of the Early Years Quality Fund. We did not have to look very far, because, very helpfully, the President of United Voice, Michael Crosby, appearing before a Senate committee some little while ago, in response to the question, 'Are you using this fund to sign up members to your union?' said:                 Of course we are. We have signed up workers all the way through the _ campaign.                 _   _   _                 Yes, it is true: we want to be a powerful union in this sector.                 But what disturbed me and what is reflected in the report is this, and I want to quote a couple of examples:                 Staff reported being told by union reps that unless they joined [the union] they wouldn't get _ funding and they're letting down everyone else at their centre.                 Peak bodies also reported that staff at member service providers were phoned at home late at night, causing 'distress, angst, and disruption within our workplaces'. There is evidence, clearly delineated in this report, that the requirement to have an enterprise agreement was used by United Voice to increase its membership.                 The department advises that it monitored all media streams relevant to the Early Years Quality Fund and that the Big Steps Facebook page made several statements that staff needed to join the union in order to be eligible for funding. A couple of examples that I am also going to table include:                 Unions are pushing their way into services using the threat of the fund to make us sign up - a tactic which our staff find appalling as the fund should be distributed evenly _                 Also:                 The union representative who came out insisted on speaking with every educator and telling them if they did not sign up on that day, they would cause our centre to miss out on the pay rise.                 Who presided over this shambles? The shadow minister, the member for Adelaide: no leadership, no advice; just sat there, a puppet of the union movement, using something and pretending - and using a group of vulnerable workers to achieve -                      Madam Speaker, to assist the House, I do withdraw.

  No. I will tell you why. Because the budget is presented on a four-year basis - he was the Treasurer! He was the last Treasurer! This is a revelation - a four-year basis. Secondly, we inherited a budget that did not properly reflect what was actually happening in the public sector.                     Oh! How about that? What a surprise. So we could not trust the Labor Party when they were in government, but now they are asking for a big trust -                      I do not think there were two people more relieved at a change of government than the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of the Department of Finance: 'Phew, what a relief! We've got rid of that mob!' I will tell you what: when the MYEFO is released next week, it will show, to the shame of the Labor Party, the true state of the budget. Let us go back to this issue of the Reserve Bank. Somehow they think this is a game -                      a game that we put $8.8 billion into the Reserve Bank. They are all about arguing the process. The bottom line is that they are not arguing the policy because they do not understand it. They are not that sophisticated over there that they should know. There are three major potential risks next year to the world economy: No. 1 is tapering; No. 2 is the stress tests on the European banks, which are significant; and No. 3 is the risk to the debt limit in the United States. They do not understand the ramifications of that in the Labor Party. They did not understand it when it happened before and they do not understand it now.                 We have made sure that our institutions are at their strongest to deal with whatever lies ahead. I have put $8.8 billion into the Reserve Bank on behalf of the coalition government to make sure the Reserve Bank has all the ammunition it needs to deal with the challenges that lie ahead. That is what a good government does - it makes sure that you are at your best and can possibly withstand whatever the world throws at you. That is a good lesson for Labor. They did not get that in government. They did not understand that you have to be at your strongest. They took it for granted when they had a river of surpluses coming forward. They took it for granted when they had pockets full of money thanks to John Howard and Peter Costello. They took it for granted when they had an unemployment rate with a four in front of it.                 What have they left? They have left endless deficit and debt that exceeds half a trillion dollars. They have left an economy with falling terms of trade and rising unemployment. The only thing holding it up are the expectations from the community that the coalition can do it better, and we will.

  I thank the member for Boothby. He understands the seriousness of this issue in South Australia and the impact that this congestion is having on South Australia and Adelaide in particular. The member for Hindmarsh also knows. He is constantly lobbying to ensure that South Road is upgraded within a decade, as the infrastructure Prime Minister has committed to.                 We are getting on with the job. I have been working with the South Australian government on getting a Darlington study underway. We are funding the Darlington study to ensure that the plan is in place to be able to follow through with our $500 million commitment. This is what this government will do. The Abbott government made a commitment at the election, and we will follow through with it. That is a novel prospect for some on the other side, but we will follow through. As the infrastructure Prime Minister committed to, we will upgrade the north-south corridor in a decade. We will get on with the Darlington project. We are working with the state government to do so but we will move on with the Torrens-to-Torrens project as well because it is an important project.                 There have been some ill-informed claims made by some interested in this issue. What the Prime Minister said very clearly in South Australia last month was that we believe we need to give South Australia that productivity boost to bring the economy out of the doldrums, where the South Australian Labor government after 12 years had dumped it, in combination with six years of a terrible federal Labor government. As the Treasurer just said, the coalition will put in place an infrastructure agenda - which we will have much more to say about very soon - which will ensure that we build the roads of the 21st century. We will address the issues that the RAA has raised that the member for Boothby focused on. We will address the issues the member for Hindmarsh is focused on and we will ensure that Adelaide retains its title of the '20-minute city'.

  JB Rousselot and I are very flattered to learn that the opposition regards our ancient couta boat as a yacht. It was built in 1923, and it is, in fact, the same age as my father-in-law, who insists, however, that he has more of his original parts then does the boat. JB Rousselot has done an outstanding job in heading the transformation and review at the NBN Co., and I would have thought that the honourable members opposite would have had a little bit more class than to sink to the character assassination practised by Senator Conroy in the Senate committee. It is a low effort to impugn JB Rousselot's ability.                 Unlike Mike Kaiser, who was employed by the Labor Party at the NBN Co., JB Rousselot is, in fact, qualified to work at a telco. He has worked in telecommunications for over a decade. He is an engineer. He has a degree from one of the oldest engineering schools in the world, the Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussees - which, as Mr Ripoll would understand is a school of bridges and roads - which was founded by the King of France, Louis XVI. He is a highly qualified individual, and the best that the Labor Party can do is combine with Senator Conroy in a desperate effort to smear the work that is being done on the strategic review. The truth is that the Labor Party have misled, spun and deceived on broadband for four years. They know that there has been an objective review undertaken by KordaMentha, Deloitte, Boston Consulting Group and leading executives at the NBN Co., and the shadow Attorney-General does not want you to -                      Tomorrow we will see the truth about the NBN. The Labor Party do not want to hear it. They do not want to know how many billions of dollars they have wasted. They do not want to know how many falsehoods they have told. They do not want to know about how distorted a reality they still live in on this great project. The truth will out, and it will be out tomorrow.

  This example is just so typical of what is happening to businesses right across the nation. The impact of the carbon tax on their costs is costing jobs, it is costing competitiveness, and it is making Australian industry think twice about whether they can invest in this country. The meat processing sector is one of those that is affected perhaps worse than most by the carbon tax because they are hit in so many different ways. Someone like Homebush Export Meat Company is affected as a result of the carbon tax that they pay on their direct emissions. They pay it on their electricity. They pay carbon tax on their gas. They pay carbon tax on their water. They pay carbon tax on their refrigerants. And, of course, if the Labor Party has its way, they will also pay carbon tax on transport. This all makes the Homebush Export Meat Company, like all other meat exporters in Australia, just so much less competitive than they otherwise would be. There was $6,000 on his electricity bill alone. But he would also be paying much higher refrigeration costs for his refrigeration needs. In fact, the unit price for the gas that is used in his refrigerants and his freezers has gone from $129 to $2,492. The unit price has gone from $129 to $2,492 as a direct result of Labor's carbon tax. This is the kind of burden that Australian meat exporters can ill afford and have to try and address.                 The carbon tax will be a hindrance to everyone in business until it goes. Unfortunately, we have an opposition that has not listened to what the people have said in their judgement on the carbon tax. This tax has to go. We have a mandate from the people to get rid of it. The Greens and the Labor Party have enough termination notices on their CV as it is as a result of this carbon tax, without resisting the legislation even further. It is time we get on with the task of getting rid of this carbon tax so Australian businesses can be properly competitive.

  I thank the member for Hinkler for his second question to me this week. He recognises how important it is for the parliament to repeal the carbon tax legislation, to get rid of the carbon tax, and how important it is for Queensland families and Queensland small businesses, because the carbon tax increases the cost of everything. Particularly, it increases the cost of doing business in Queensland.                 Over the last two years the average Queensland family has paid more than $300 in carbon tax on their electricity bills. With the carbon tax removal, the typical Queensland household would save $116 next year, and the average family of four would save $174. That would go up to $240 with the abolition of the carbon tax - on just their electricity bills next year. Of course, on average, Australian families would be $550 better off next year with the abolition of the carbon tax.                 So why are the Labor Party blocking this? The Labor Party said they wanted to terminate the carbon tax. The legislation is now in the Senate, and the Labor Party are opposing their own policy to terminate the carbon tax. A typical Queensland small business would save $152 next year in electricity prices if we got rid of the carbon tax, if they did not have that burden on their business. And that is just electricity - of course, it flows through to every part of the business. For example, for operators on the Barrier Reef, it flows through to the cost of fuel for their boats. It flows through in tourism to the electricity bills in the hotels, and that then flows through to every hotel bill.                 So I would just say to the Labor Party: if you care about economic growth, the best thing you could possibly do at this moment is support the repeal of the carbon tax, because getting rid of the carbon tax, according to Treasury's own modelling, will improve economic growth. So, if you want to grow the economy, get rid of the carbon tax. If you want to help families, get rid of the carbon tax. If you want to help small businesses, get rid of the carbon tax. As we approach the release of the mid-year budget next week, surely the Labor Party will come to realise the best thing they could do for Australians is get rid of the carbon tax.

  About 10 minutes before question time I spoke with the Chief Executive Officer of General Motors in Australia, Mike Devereux, and he informed me of the company's decision, made in Detroit, that they would be closing their operation, or a significant part of their operation, in Australia and New Zealand by the end of 2017. I did not speak about it earlier in the House because Mr Devereux is at this moment addressing his employees and I felt that the employees had a right to hear it from their own management rather than through the media or reporting of question time.                 Naturally, like all members in the House, we regret the fact that GM is to phase down its operations in this country. Holden has been an iconic national brand for Australians, a part of our heritage.                     It has meant a great deal to Australians over several generations. Many of us have had the pleasure of travelling in and owning Australian-built Holdens, and it is a pity that that will not continue into the future. This government indicated right from the very beginning that we wanted Holden to remain manufacturing cars in Australia.                     We want to have a strong and active motor-vehicle-manufacturing industry in Australia. We, unlike Labor, do not believe that manufacturing ought to be yesterday's industry in this country. We want, in fact, to see a manufacturing sector that is strong, vibrant, and able to stand on its own feet and make significant contributions to Australia. That is part of the reason we acted to get rid of the fringe benefits tax impost that Labor had imposed. That is why we want to get rid of the carbon tax now so that car making can be more competitive in this country.                 On this day, though, we are most concerned about the capacity of those who have been working in this industry - some 1,600 at the Elizabeth vehicle-manufacturing plant and 1,300 at the Holden Victoria plant - who will no longer be employed by that company sometime between now and 2017. The government stands ready to work constructively with General Motors to support these people through this difficult time. We will do what we can, with General Motors, to achieve the very best possible outcomes for these people.                 Holden will still have a significant presence in Australia and we want to make sure that their dealers and their employees are supported through this transition. But this is a difficult day for Australians, particularly for the Holden employees. And we will stand with them to work constructively to make sure that they can transition into good jobs in other parts of our industry.

  I thank the member for Denison for that question. It is a good question, and I acknowledge that his home state has been subject to very serious bushfires as recently as this year. One capability that we have in Australia to address what is always an ever-present danger is firefighting aircraft. They remain a very important tool for us. We know a lot about this. We have been using firefighting aircraft in Australia since the 1920s, and we have been using water-bombing aircraft since the 1960s. The consensus among the experts is that we get a better bang for our bucks by leasing those aircrafts. That allows us the flexibility of taking advantage of emerging technologies as well.                 Currently, in Australia we have a very significant fleet, and it covers a vast geographical area. It includes such things as the Erickson Air-Cranes - mentioned in the member's question - which are better known as Elvis, even though there are quite a few of them, and a number of heavy-lift helicopters as well as surveillance and intelligence-gathering aircraft, which assist us with hazard mapping.                  Leasing aircraft allows us to acquire more aircraft and expert crew for our summer season. Purchasing a standing fleet of aircraft would be incredibly expensive and not considered to be good value for money, because of the extensive costs associated with maintaining that fleet of fixed-wing aircraft and also maintaining and supporting pilots, engineers and specialist support crew.                  We do have a very significant capability. We work at it in conjunction with our state and territory colleagues through the National Aerial Firefighting Centre. This centre leases specialist aircraft for us, and brings them to Australia for our summer season. The Commonwealth government contributes about $14 million per year for that capability. The states and territories contribute a similar sort of amount.                 To help the member for Denison, and to highlight the cost of fixed-wing aircraft - a lot of this information is commercial-in-confidence - to purchase one Canadian fixed-wing aircraft would cost us about $40 million. You could understand that the numbers of aircraft deployed to deal with emergency situations could be quite significant. In New South Wales, during the recent bushfire emergency about six weeks ago, the New South Wales Rural Fire Service deployed about 90 aircraft to deal with the height of that emergency. So you could understand that maintaining a fixed fleet of that large volume of aircraft would be incredibly expensive. And it is not considered to be good value for money.                 The other point I would like to make is that we have looked at using larger fixed-wing aircraft for this sort of work. We have trialled RAAF C-130s, and also, more recently, a DC-10, but the expert consensus still remains that, because it is very difficult for those larger fixed-wing aircraft to operate in difficult geographic locations -

  I thank the member for Wright for his question and congratulate him on what a fantastic job he does. He is my neighbour, so I guess I am a bit biased, but the member for Wright does a fantastic job in his electorate. Not only did he have a very difficult start in that electorate because of the floods, but he has gone on to make sure that he is there for every issue that the people in his community face.                 The issue that his community is facing at the moment is a cost-of-living pressure coming from the carbon tax. We did not need this report in the Courier Mail today to know that electricity prices are going up because of the carbon tax. But this report today in the Courier Mail highlights the fact that Queenslanders can expect an increase in their power bills of $270 per annum.                     I do not mind taking that interjection, because if anyone is out of touch it is those who sit on the other side. How out of touch can you be when families are facing power increases and the Queensland Competition Authority says that without the carbon tax the increase will be more than halved?                  How out of touch can you be when faced with those statistics that you continue to support a tax on households, when the people of Australia have given those on this side of the chamber a mandate to remove the tax? That side is so far out of touch that they do not know the pain that families are going through at the moment in relation to increased electricity prices.                     The figures released today by the Competition Authority show that removing the carbon tax would cut the increase in Tariff 11 prices, from 13.6 per cent to 5.4 per cent. That is more than half - halving the increase is something that is important to every Queenslander. Of course, it does not just relate to Queenslanders; it relates to every household and every business in Australia. Every household and every business in Australia is being choked by this carbon tax. We want to start 2014 with some momentum in business. We want to start the year with some confidence. We need to get rid of this carbon tax. We need to make sure that households can see an end to the tyranny that the Labor Party imposed upon them through higher taxes, higher carbon taxes and higher electricity prices. The people who sit opposite are committing Queenslanders and all Australians to higher electricity prices.

  How quickly the opposition degenerate to raw politics. When the workers of the Holden factory are going through an extraordinarily traumatic time -                      there is not one word of sympathy from those who sit opposite. There is not one word of 'We'll cooperate with what this government puts in place, to ensure the industry and economic diversity of Adelaide is continued.' Not one word. Straight to the politics - the problem that they created. They were the ones who were in power for the last six years -                      They were the ones who oversaw the industry lose two manufacturers - half the manufacturing capacity. They are the ones who laid the foundation for this closure. They are the ones who failed to address the fundamental economic issues that are affecting Holden. They are the ones who would not even revoke the carbon tax to try to help Holden. They would not even be a part of that. I am asked specifically about cuts in funding. It brings to mind -                      if I can get a word in edgeways -                      Excellent.                     Keep going. Are you going to warn him, Madam Speaker?                     Those who interject the loudest have the most impact on this decision. They are the ones who were in government for six years. Let me just outline to the House, for their benefit.                     When I left this portfolio there were 335,000 cars being made in Australia and when I resumed it, after the Labor Party, that number had dropped to 221,000.                      They continue to interject, but I will keep going. The reality is that the number of businesses involved -                      had dropped from 200 to 150 under their watch -                      The amount of money taken out of the car sector was $1.23 billion by the Labor Party, two tranches of $400 million out of the green car fund and then finally the coup de grace of $430 million out of the Cleaner Car Rebate Scheme - $1.23 billion taken out by that government. We know, just to finish the industry off, they introduced a $1.8 billion fringe benefits tax, which drove sales, including Holden's, through the floor.                     They are hypocrites. They did nothing for six years and now they want to politicise the payment to the workers who have suffered today.

  I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for his question.                     Now that Mike Devereux has had time to speak to his workers, it is appropriate for us -                      Obviously, they are not taking it too seriously. Now that Mike Devereux has had the chance to speak to his own workers, I want to provide -                    The member for Isaacs then left the chamber.                      There wasn't that outrage around when, under Labor, Mitsubishi left and Ford left! Where was that outrage? Where was that outrage from Labor? What a surprise! Ford left and Mitsubishi left and Labor wasn't too outraged then.                     We are the ones who are concerned about the workers not only at Holden but at all of the components manufacturers associated -                      Now that Mr Devereux has had -                      Now that Mr Devereux has had the opportunity to speak to his workers, I say on behalf of the government - together with the Minister for Industry, the Acting Prime Minister, the member for Sturt and all members - that we will work closely with the government of South Australia, the opposition in South Australia, the unions and all of the stakeholders to ensure that the fact that Holden are leaving in 2017 will not lead to a significant economic downturn in South Australia or Victoria. We will do everything we can to assist during this transition. This is hugely important and we will do it, because it is not a surprise that this should have happened. The members know it is not a surprise - and why? An OECD report to the member for Lilley in 2012, when his own former chief of staff was at the OECD, recommended:                 As underlined by the authorities, there is a case for help to smooth the transition, but not preventing it, when its pace and scale make it difficult to absorb, for instance at the regional level.                 That was written in relation to the closure of car plants in Australia.                 The facts are that the car industry in Australia has had enormous financial support from taxpayers. During the period when there has been a significant reduction in activity in Australia, the government - whether Labor or Liberal - has provided enormous financial support: over $1 billion a year. But the net result is that we have seen a halving in the production of Australian cars on a world scale. These are the things that we have to deal with in order to address some of the challenges for Holden -

  Obviously I am not competent to comment on the statements of a Holden spokesman; that is a matter for them.                   The member for McMahon then left the chamber.                     I did indicate yesterday that I thought it was important for Holden to make their position clear so that Australians knew whether they intended to keep manufacturing in this country or not. Holden have made that statement now and, whilst I regret the nature of the statement and the fact that Holden are to downsize their operations in Australia, they have at least delivered certainty to the Australian marketplace and, in particular, certainty to their employees. Holden will continue to have a large number of employees in Australia but some will no longer -                    The member for Charlton then left the chamber.                     be needed because of the closure of their manufacturing operations. This downsizing is going to occur over a period of four years and, for that reason, we as a government will stand ready to work with them -                    The member for Moreton then left the chamber.                     to try and make this transition as smooth as possible. There is one other thing I would like to convey to the House from my discussions with Mr Devereux. He said in his statement that he would not be seeking to blame governments, either state or federal, for the decision that Detroit has made. They have - to use his words - confronted a perfect storm of events which are affecting their decisions about their future as a company, not just in Australia but in other parts of the world. The reality is that there are a number of things that have happened over a number of years which have made vehicle manufacturing in Australia less competitive than it once was. It is self-evident to us all that wages paid in Australia are much higher than wages in other parts of the world; costs in Australia are much higher than in other parts of the world. On the other hand, this is a country with a skilled workforce and the natural advantages of working in an environment where there can be a supportive community and people live in a pleasant lifestyle.                   The member for Parramatta then left the chamber.                     This government has sought to work with the motor vehicle industry to make its environment as satisfactory as possible so that they can manufacture and do so in a profitable way. I am not going to take the opportunity again to refer to what happened over the last few terms of government. The reality is we must face the situation as it is now and get on with helping the Holden workers to make a transition and helping the economy of South Australia to move into new areas where it can prosper and provide work for its people.

  I thank the member for Macquarie for her question. The challenges we face in relation to the budget are obvious, given the fact that we now have $20 billion of savings - $5 billion of the $20 billion was actually announced by Labor - that are held up and blocked in the Senate by the Labor Party and the Greens. Of course, the Australian economy is facing challenges. That is what we have inherited from Labor.                 The challenges identified by the chairman and CEO, Dan Akerson, today in Detroit are the same challenges that many other manufacturers and businesses in Australia are facing. I quote the CEO of General Motors Holden in Detroit. He says:                 The decision to end manufacturing in Australia reflects the perfect storm of negative influences the automotive industry faces in the country, including the sustained strength of the Australian dollar, high cost of production, small domestic market and arguably the most competitive and fragmented auto market in the world.                 He says that and he is right: it is a challenging market in which to operate. And it is a market that has been heavily subsidised by Australian governments - in the case of Holden, $1.8 billion between 2001 and 2012. But, if money were the issue as to why Holden is leaving Australia, then why did Ford leave and Mitsubishi leave whilst Labor was in government? The money was flowing, but they decided to leave.                 One of the things that needs to be noted is the high cost of production. I say emphatically to the workers at Toyota, who are due to make a decision this Friday about a proposal put to them by the management of Toyota: please vote for your jobs this Friday. The AMWU is recommending a vote against a proposal put forward by Toyota to try and have a fairer arrangement in the workplace. For example, Toyota exports 70 per cent of its produce to the Middle East. At the moment, Toyota has to close its plant for 21 days over Christmas. How does that work when you are trying to export to the Middle East, where they do not celebrate Christmas? And now Toyota has gone back to the workers and said, 'Please reduce this to 10 days so that we can have consistent supply,' and the AMWU is recommending a vote against it. The AMWU would not even meet with Toyota management, because the AMWU wanted to have 53 people turn up -                      to a meeting with Toyota management in order to negotiate the deal. So the destiny of other manufacturers in Australia is inevitably in all the hands of all the stakeholders, including in particular the union leaders.

  I thank the member for his question. This is a very important issue that confronts us, ensuring that we have competitive industries in this country. It seems passing strange that the member can feign support for these workers at a time when the opposition are standing in the way of this government making Australia a more competitive place, because that is the key to ensuring the future of jobs, ensuring that we have a competitive economy that is in fact operating at a world-class level. So rather than the assistance of the members opposite, we have the gaggle opposite just standing there and moaning rather than getting behind the abolition of the carbon tax, the abolition of the mining tax and the government improving the efficiency of this economy.                  But with regard to the matters that the member raises specifically, I would say that any worker made redundant in the automotive manufacturing industry will receive immediate access to intensive employment assistance support through the Automotive Industry Structural Adjustment Program. This program is delivered by Job Services Australia and provides support for job seekers at a stream 3 level. That is support. But the best way that we can ensure the future of these workers is to make the Australian economy as competitive as it can be. So it is about time members opposite got out of the way of this government and allowed us to make Australia the efficient economy that it should be.

  I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. As a senior South Australian in the parliament and as the Minister for Education representing the Minister for Employment, can I say that it is a very sad day for South Australia that this announcement has been made by General Motors in Detroit. Nobody should be making light or politics about this decision. This is a decision that affects thousands and thousands of South Australians and Victorians. It is a tragic situation that Australia is in the position that it is. It is the kind of country that makes it very difficult, very difficult to manufacture such high-end products as motor vehicles because of our labour costs; because of the way that we do business in this country; because of our high Australian dollar; because of our lack of export markets, particularly for Holden; and because of decisions that have been made beyond our shores that we have had very little, if any, control over. South Australians have been well aware of this for a long time. South Australians understand how important the car industry is to our state, but they also understand how fragile it has been for a very long time. This government, as the previous government did, tried to keep those operations in South Australia and Victoria because we always put people first - never ideology, always people. The Deputy Prime Minister has outlined very well the difficulties that Holden and other car manufacturers have faced. Mitsubishi faced these difficulties and Mitsubishi closed. It does not matter on whose watch it closed, Mitsubishi closed.                     Ford faced these problems and Ford closed.                     Again, it does not matter on whose watch Ford closed - Ford closed. Holden is closing in 2017. So this is not a day -                    The member for Corio and the member for Adelaide then left the chamber.                     for political point scoring. It is a day to think about the workers and families of South Australia and Melbourne who will be affected by this decision. This government stands ready to do everything in its power to support the employment of workers in Victoria and South Australia. We will announce over the coming months and years ways to ensure that we can -                      Well, that is right, because it is closing in 2017 - ways to support the workers and their families in South Australia. I just quote the statement:                  The decision to end manufacturing in Australia reflects the perfect storm of negative influences the automotive industry faces in the country, including the sustained strength of the Australian dollar, high cost of production, small domestic market and arguably the most competitive and fragmented auto market in the world _

  The question indeed contains a great deal of argument which I would dispute. The reality is that this government has taken substantial steps in the short time it has been in office to actually improve the environment for the manufacturing industry in Australia and, in particular, for the car-manufacturing sector. It is unfortunate that I have to report to the House that it is well known to everybody who has been observing what has happened in the parliament over the last few weeks that the opposition, who, today are feigning concern about the fate of the industry -                      I do not wish to, in any way, downplay the concern that members opposite feel on this occasion, but please do not impugn our motives either. We have worked constructively to try and provide a better environment for the car industry in this country. You have had the opportunity to indicate support and to take a significant cost, around $400 a vehicle, off that industry by supporting us in our endeavours to get rid of the carbon tax. You would not have sought to put a significant tax on fringe benefits, had you been really concerned -                      So I take offence at the way in which the opposition is seeking to imply some kind of ill intent on this side towards the car industry which we as Australians admire, and for which we as Australians have worked together and are determined to do what we can to make it a better industry for our nation as a whole.                     In addition to the matters and the initiatives that I have mentioned earlier, let us never forget that there is still more than $1 billion in the Automotive Transformation Scheme which has not been allocated. So there is significant funding there, still available, to assist the automotive industry in this country. So suggestions that reductions of $500 million, or whatever it might be at some stage in the future, have made any impact in relation to the industry at this time are clearly nonsense. There is substantial funding still available.                 It may be forgotten that the original question was actually about the welfare of the workers, and let me assure you that we share those concerns. As I said earlier, we will be working with the South Australian government and the industry itself and all other interested parties to try and find new workplace opportunities, and we call on the opposition to work with us constructively to create the kind of environment in this country which encourages manufacturers and supports those who invest in this country.

  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question because this is a very serious subject. As I have said before and will say again, these are sad times for everyone associated with Holden - the workers, the families of the workers and the communities where the major Holden installations are based.                 As members on both sides of the chamber would know, governments of both persuasions have offered very considerable support to the motor industry over the years and certainly this government stood ready and stands ready to continue to offer very significant support to the motor industry. The difficulty is that, as the local MD of Holden, Mike Devereux, made clear on radio today, Holden's difficulties have been building up over many, many years. The truth is, as the Holden spokesman said publicly yesterday, 'It would be wrong to simply attribute their departure -                      As the spokesman for Holden said yesterday, 'It would be wrong to simply attribute it' - that is to say, this impending closure - 'to action or inaction on the part of the government.' So there we have it: 'It would be simply wrong to attribute it to action or inaction on the part of the government.' I am not seeking to play the blame game here, I am not seeking to play politics here and I think it would raise the reputation of the Leader of the Opposition if he did likewise. I had several meetings with the motor industry as Leader of the Opposition, including with Mr Devereux, and since the election there have been regular meetings between the Minister for Industry and the Holden company.

  I do thank the member for Boothby for his question. I appreciate that the future of the motor industry is something that he has been grappling with as a local member and as a member of the coalition for several years. This is a sad time for Holden workers, their families and their communities. I want to make it very clear to Holden workers and to the people of Australia that the difficulties which Holden is now encountering is no reflection on Holden workers, who are good workers, who have worked well, and it is no reflection on this country. What Holden announced yesterday is part of a worldwide reorganisation and, amongst other things, involves the closure of plants in Korea and the withdrawal of the Chevrolet brand from Europe. It was, as the managing director of Holden Australia has made clear, a perfect storm. It has been building up for a long time -                      It has been building as a result of Australia's high dollar, high costs and low volumes. At a time like this, we need to be conscious of the limitations of government, as well as of the government's potential. The then government was unable to prevent the departure from Australia of Mitsubishi in 2008. The then government was unable to prevent the imminent closure of Ford, in 2016, when this matter came before it some time ago. The then government, in March last year, believed that it had secured the future of Holden for a decade. But, despite the investment by the then government, of an additional $275 million, the future of Holden was not secured.                 Our job now is to build on our fundamental strengths. It is not to play politics, it is not to indulge in the blame game and it is not to peddle false hope. That is why, in coming days, the government will announce new measures that focus on the strengths of the regions most impacted by Holden's departure in 2017, because there are great strengths in these regions - strengths in export education, R&amp;D and niche manufacturing. We will not let these people down. But our challenge is to get them from one job to another job and we will not fail.

  I thank the member for Grey for his question regarding this very important issue. I note that he, as a fellow South Australian, recognises that South Australians are not interested in the doom and gloom being preached by the opposition on this issue. Nor are they interested in the political pointscoring being taken by the Premier of South Australia, Jay Weatherill, who has been in government for 12 years in that state and has made no effort to diversify the economy.                  Only three months ago the South Australian public elected a new government, full of promise, with a positive attitude about the future. Of course, while they are disappointed about the decision that General Motors made in Detroit, they are well aware that that decision could have been coming for some time.                      Under the previous government, they sat there and watched what happened to Mitsubishi.                     And they watched what happened to Ford.                     And they know that when the head of General Motors says:                 The decision to end manufacturing in Australia reflects the perfect storm of negative influences the automotive industry faces in the country, including the sustained strength of the Australian dollar, high cost of production, small domestic market and arguably the most competitive and fragmented auto market in the world.                   The member for Wakefield then left the chamber.                     When they hear the head of General Motors say that, they know it is true. But they also expect the government to have a positive, energetic, enthusiastic attitude to the future of South Australia and the job prospects in our state. This government is getting on with the job of putting into place exactly those policies that will guarantee jobs for the future in South Australia. We are introducing policies like one-stop shops for environmental approvals, scrapping the carbon tax and the Minerals Resource Rent Tax - the job-destroying taxes.                     We are scrapping Labor's plans for a $1.8 billion tax on fringe benefits, which would hurt the car industry. We are reducing red tape and regulation in the higher education sector. Most importantly, we are improving productivity in states like South Australia through transport infrastructure - the North-South Corridor.                     We are putting in place the kind of stable decision-making for government that gives companies like BHP Billiton the confidence to re-examine increasing expansion of the Olympic Dam mine in South Australia.                     Under the previous government companies like BHP Billiton made decisions not to go ahead with mines like Olympic Dam, because they could not rely on the government of the day to keep policies from one moment to the next.                     This government is putting in place the foundations that will give South Australians long-term job stability, and I am pleased to be part of it.

  We did not ignore the business case.                     If members opposite are such geniuses when it comes to saving car companies, what happened to Ford and what happened to Mitsubishi? I am not in the business of playing politics here but, if members opposite are, I pose this question to them: if it is so easy to keep companies in this country, what happened to Ford, what happened to Mitsubishi and what happened to the $275 million former Prime Minister Gillard said had saved Holden?                     What happened to the promise that Julia Gillard had saved Holden with $275 million of taxpayers' money?                     The truth, as the Holden spokesman said publicly yesterday:                 It would be wrong to attribute the decision to government action or inaction.                 Yes, there are good things that government can do, and we will do the good things that can be done to help manufacturing in this country.                 To follow up on the excellent answer from the Leader of the House a few moments ago, he talked about consistency and stability in government decision making. I refer members opposite to Senator Kim Carr, the former industry minister, who said in his book, when he was being truthful -                      I was asked what government has been doing for the car industry. Let me quote Senator Kim Carr: 'International company executives wondered just what they had to do to get a consistent government policy commitment in Australia under the Labor government.' This is when Kim Carr was the minister for industry.

  I thank the honourable member for his question and recognise his keen interest in the economic development of his area and indeed all parts of Victoria and, for that matter, all other Australian states. The coalition is getting on with the business of providing the economic infrastructure that is so important to building a strong economy and a strong nation.                 In the member's home state of Victoria there have already been a number of significant announcements about major new road projects. The East-West Link to which the Commonwealth has committed to provide $1.5 billion will certainly make a big difference to traffic flows in central Melbourne. That is an important project that is illustrative of the work that we intend to do to help make our economic infrastructure able to support stronger economies, jobs growth and additional community infrastructure right across the state.                 In South Australia, we have also made announcements in relation to the north-south road and our commitment to improve that corridor and make a real difference to Adelaide and its capability to service growing industry. They are part of a comprehensive national plan. We intend to make further announcements about our commitments to economic infrastructure over the days and months ahead to build a strong national road and transport network that can deliver the very best possible results for our nation.                 The coalition has also announced $342 million worth of projects under our community development grants program. That includes 86 projects worth $53 million in Victoria and a further 19 projects worth $26 million in South Australia. Those sorts of projects will help local communities to get some of the important economic and social infrastructure that they need to be strong even when their communities suffer setbacks, and particularly setbacks associated the closures of important industries.                 The question asked about the impediments that there are to delivering this kind of important economic infrastructure, and they are obvious. There are impediments like the mining tax and the carbon tax, taxes that we are trying to get rid of because they hold back industry in this country but taxes that the Labor Party seem to want to entrench in our economy. Labor seems to have lost track of the fact that if you want to have a strong economy it has to have strong economic infrastructure to support it. It needs the taxes that impede industry removed. It is time that Labor got out of the way and let us deliver on this important economic reform.

  There has been no reduction in car industry funding. There is the same car funding available today as there has been. Let me refer members opposite to a statement by the former Prime Minister, Ms Gillard. She said:                 It gives me great pleasure to be able to say to the House that we have worked together with Holden and we have secured Holden to manufacture cars in Australia for the next decade. Holden will be manufacturing two new-generation motor vehicles here in Australia for the next decade.                 I simply make this point: how can it be the job of this government to save Holden when the former government said it had already been done?                     The former government committed an additional $275 million to Holden. Unfortunately, it was not enough. I have no desire to play politics on this, but if it was so easy to save Holden why was the former government not able to deliver on its commitment? If it was so easy to save Ford, what happened under the former government? If it was so easy to save the motor industry, what happened to Mitsubishi under the former government?                 What we are going to do is put in place the economic fundamentals that will give the manufacturers of this country the best possible chance to survive and to flourish. We will reduce taxes, we will reduce regulation and we will add certainty to government decision making. Unfortunately, the Labor Party is against all of those things.

  I thank the member for Barker -                      I thank the member for Barker for his very good question, because he wants to get rid of the carbon tax, and Mr Warren McLean from the Master Butchers Co-op wants to get rid of the carbon tax - in fact, Australia wants to get rid of the carbon tax. The only people who don't want to get rid of the carbon tax are the Labor Party and the Greens, who want to keep the carbon tax in place.                 What is true, what is irrefutable, is that the carbon tax adds to the cost of business in Australia. As General Motors said yesterday, we have become a high-cost country for production. And as the Master Butchers Co-op have said, they are having to deal with a $330,000 increase in electricity and gas bills because of the carbon tax.                     That is in 2012-13. According to MBL that equates to $15,000 per employee. That is their carbon tax bill. If they cannot pass that on to customers, particularly in a global marketplace - the way, for example, Virgin said that they could not pass on the carbon tax to their customers -                      and Qantas said they had to absorb overwhelmingly the cost of the carbon tax. If businesses need to absorb the cost of the carbon tax, it increases the cost of production, it reduces the profitability of the business and then people start to look to invest elsewhere. It is a no-brainer.                 The Labor Party does not understand that, if you keep laying taxes and more regulation on Australian businesses, sooner or later they will look for cheaper places to go and work: they will look into Asia; they will look into other parts of the world where there is no carbon tax, where there is no excessive regulation, where there is no union militancy, where there is an environment that is conducive to investment and growth.                 The fact is the coalition knows this. We know that the best way to remain competitive, the best way to meet head-on the challenges of the world, is to reduce the cost of doing business in Australia - get rid of the carbon tax, get rid of the mining tax, get rid of the regulation. The Labor Party want to keep all the impediments to business growth and then they want to cry crocodile tears when people go and invest elsewhere and turn away from Australia. I say to the Labor Party: get real - if you want to really help production in Australia, get rid of the carbon tax.

  All of us in this House, on this side no less than on the other side, are devastated that Holden has gone. We are all united in our disappointment and anguish at the demise in 2017 of our oldest, and for much of its history our largest, motor manufacturer - we are all devastated. But if Holden was so easy to save - and I do not want to play politics here - why didn't members opposite save it? Let's face it: they had six years to do so. And they are asking us to do, in less than three months, what they were incapable of doing in six years.                   The member for Parramatta then left the chamber.                     It should not be necessary for us to save Holden, because, according to members opposite, when they were in government, they had already saved it. And if the $275 million more that members opposite tipped in in March last year was not sufficient to save Holden, what on earth do members opposite expect us to have done? To have doubled the money? Seriously: what exactly do they expect us to have done? How much money does the Leader of the Opposition think taxpayers should have put in? For how long should taxpayers have put in that extra money?                 We made it absolutely crystal clear that we were prepared to continue to offer Holden a generous level of support, and we deeply regret that that has not been enough. So, the challenge now is to take appropriate steps to build on our nation's enduring economic strengths to try to ensure that our economy is as flexible and as low-cost as possible. That is why we are cutting the carbon tax. That is why we are abolishing the mining tax. That is why we are cutting regulation. And we just wish members opposite would get out of our way and let these sensible measures go ahead.

  I thank the new member for Barton for his question. Well done - what a great victory that was. It is vitally important to be very honest about the state of the budget and the state of the economy. The member for Barton might have heard of it, but he was not here: on more than 500 occasions the previous government promised a surplus. It is hard to believe, isn't it? The member for Lilley is not here at the moment; he is obviously having lunch with Paul Keating, giving Paul Keating some wisdom.                     Oh, his daughter's wedding - well, I am very happy for him. I wish him well, and I wish her well. We have great faith in the member for Lilley, because the member for Lilley was consistent with Labor values of not being quite as transparent as they could be about the real state of the budget or the economy.                   The member for Rankin then left the chamber.                     Why would Labor, on more than 400 occasions, promise a surplus that they never delivered? Well, the revelation has come out today. I picked up on this stray email from a Mr John McTernan. Remember him? We do! It is an email to chiefs of staff and media advisors, and it goes like this:                 We know from the groups that voters see surplus as an emblem of good economic management.                 Well, we would agree. We were the last government to deliver a surplus, the last party. He goes on to say:                 We need all ministers to explain our achievement constantly - and celebrate it.                 And celebrate a surplus!                 Cabinet has agreed that ministers need to use the following language consistently _                  No. 1: we have delivered a surplus!                 This surplus means we now have a buffer in case the global economy gets worse. _We've delivered a surplus with targeted and responsible savings while protecting the frontline services Australian families rely on in health and education.                 They are Labor's words. They all came from the spinmeister, based on groups.                 I will tell you what we are going to do. Next Tuesday at the National Press Club we are going to deliver a budget update based on the facts. It will tell the truth about the budget, which Labor never did. It will tell the truth about the economy, which Labor never did. And you have had a taste of it today with the release of the assessment on the NBN that shows that a $44 billion promised NBN rollout has blown out to $73 billion. Where did that money go? Where did that money come from? It would have come from the taxpayers of Australia if Labor had another three years in office. Now is the time to tell the truth. It takes a new government to tell the truth, and it will be a shame for Labor that it has taken this long.

  Holden certainly does not blame this government - it does not blame any government - for the predicament in which it finds itself. And given that Holden is not blaming anyone, I do not think the Leader of the Opposition should either.

  I would like to thank the member for Lyons, a man who has had a lifetime involvement in agribusiness and who knows firsthand the challenges that are currently facing the agricultural sector. As I have moved around the world in recent weeks with my trade and investment responsibilities, I have gleaned a mood of disillusionment with the big government interventionist approach that has been adopted by so many governments around the world post the global financial crisis, including those opposite.                 Many countries - such as Korea, which recently saw GMH cut the production of 100,000 cars from their country - are coming to the view that the only way to deliver sustainable economic growth which is large enough to start to make inroads into the high unemployment levels is to open up their economies far more to trade and investment and to change the priorities of their governments. This is what others are starting to realise. Those opposite never did. It is why our government sees an urgency in replacing the firestorm of choking regulation and the reckless spending of the last six years. It is why we have moved quickly to settle the free trade agreement with Korea and to move determinedly in our efforts with China, with Japan and with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.                 The Korean free trade agreement is a world-class agreement. It is an agreement which will restore Australia's competitive position and open up a raft of growth opportunities. It will result in the elimination of over 99 per cent of the tariffs that our exporters currently face across key areas including agriculture, resources, energy and manufactured goods. The new agreement will see new market openings in services, and it will see investment in areas such as finance, accounting and legal services, as well as telecommunications, education, audiovisual engineering, health and many more. It is particularly important for agriculture. Tariffs of 304 per cent will be eliminated from chipping potatoes. Tariffs of 36 to 176 per cent on dairy products will go. Tariffs on seafood, wheat, wine, chocolate, beer, horticulture, pharmaceuticals and many more will go. Tariffs on beef, in particular, will fall from 40 per cent to nothing over 15 years. For sheep meats, in the same way, it will help the member for Lyons -

  I do thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I do appreciate the diligence with which he works for the industries in his area of North Queensland in particular. It is the diligence which is shared by members on all sides of this House. All of us want to ensure that the industries in our electorates and the workers who we know and respect have the best possible future. We all accept that, and I certainly would not, for a second, attack the sincerity, the goodwill, the fair mindedness and the decency of the member for Kennedy. Nor do I attack the fair mindedness and the decency - and the good intentions, at least - of everyone in this House.                 But I do have to say to the member for Kennedy that for a long time now on both sides of politics we have accepted a floating dollar, and the member for Kennedy is right that a floating dollar went down in the middle of the 1990s. A floating dollar has gone up in more recent times to a level that did make it extremely difficult for many of our manufacturers to compete. But I am pleased to say that what goes up can come down, and the floating dollar is now down to about 90c, a level which makes it much easier for our manufacturers and for our exporters. I support the floating dollar just as, it seems, the member for Kennedy supported the floating dollar, at least when it was low in the mid-1990s. Just as well that the Reserve Bank has been, in effect, recapitalised to the tune of $8 billion because that enables the Reserve Bank to intervene prudently and appropriately in the market to try to ensure that the Australian dollar is at the best possible level.

  I thank the honourable member for his question, and I congratulate him on his election and his very fine maiden speech. During the six years of the Labor government, Australia's standing on any international broadband measure went backwards. There was rhetoric, billions of dollars spent and virtually nothing achieved of substance. As of September, under Labor, the NBN had passed a total of only 384,000 homes and businesses, including those supplied by satellite and wireless. This is barely three per cent of the 13 million premises it must reach to complete the project. It is 45 per cent of the forecast for September in the NBN Co.'s latest corporate plan, and it is one million premises behind Prime Minister Gillard's rollout announcement in December 2010. That meant that the rollout would not be completed until 2024, 3½ years later than stated under the latest corporate plan, six years later than originally promised in Labor's plan in 2009 and - wait for it - 11 years later than the Australian public were originally promised by Kevin Rudd in 2007. And, as the Treasurer has observed, there is $29 billion more to be spent.                     There has never been, in our history -                      so much money wasted and mismanaged on an infrastructure project. That is why we have gone backwards on all of the international broadband measures - because Labor could not get anything done. The reason why they could not get anything done was sheer mismanagement and incompetence. We have inherited an enormous mess in the NBN, billions of dollars wasted and forecasts missed.                 I saw the shadow minister clutching a document the previous management published a little while ago. He was saying that was the truth. Well, that document which he says is the truth says there would be 729,000 premises passed with fibre in June next year. We already know that is only going to be 467,000. So it was not the truth for very long. Every single forecast this company made under Labor has been proved wrong.                 What we have done is, for the first time, to tell the truth - a thorough, objective appraisal. It is not happy reading for anyone. It is tough. It is conservative. It is prudent. This is the way governments must govern: based on fact, not on paying people, as Labor did, to tell them what they want to hear.
