Can the Minister confirm that the Government has recognised in the Beyond Kyoto Report the need to reduce Australia's greenhouse emissions to near zero.Is the Minister aware that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently released a report on carbon capture and storage (CCS), which included contributions from the Chief Executive Officers of the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC) and the Centre for Low Emissions Technology and, in particular, that the report concluded that the price of coal power with CCS is likely to be higher than the current price of wind energy; if so, how does the Minister justify the current lack of support for an expanded Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET) that would increase use of existing low cost renewable energy technologies.Is it the case that the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (ABARE) does not expect CCS to be applied to coal-fired plants in Australia until 2015 at the earliest, with many experts predicting it will be 5 to 10 years after 2015.Does the Minister concede that Australian energy consumers in industry and households will not benefit from CCS if the projected cost of energy derived from coal power with CCS is not lower than low emission energy sources (such as wind or other renewables); if not, will the Minister explain on what basis the Government formed its view.Is the Minister aware that the recent ABARE report Technological Development and Economic Growth, commissioned by the Federal Government to assess the effectiveness of the Asia Pacific Partnership (AP6), showed that under the Partnership, global emissions would more than double by 2050.Does it remain the Minister's view that the AP6 will be more effective at reducing emissions than Kyoto and that Australia will meet its Kyoto targets in any case; if so, why does Australia not ratify the Kyoto Protocol.Has the Government recognised the need to reduce Australia's greenhouse emissions to near zero in the Beyond Kyoto Report; if so, why is there a delay in emissions reductions achievable from wind and other renewable energy sources at a similar or lower cost to Australian households and industry, in favour of CCS which will not come on line for 15 to 30 years.Does the Minister concede that a larger penetration of renewable power sources into the Australian energy sector would help achieve the Government's aim to reduce greenhouse emissions, and much sooner than CCS; if not, why not.Could reducing emissions in the near future be achieved by increasing the MRET from 9,500 GWh; if not, why not.What other methods are being considered to reduce Australia's emissions in the short term.Does the Government have cost/benefit analyses comparing (a) CCS applied to coal plants and (b) CCS applied to gas plants, with other low emission technologies such as wind and renewable energy sources; if so, will the Minister make them available; if they do not exist, on what basis does the Minister continue to advocate the need for CCS as the primary source of carbon dioxide emissions reduction. </title></top>

Has the Government indicated to State and Territory Governments that funding will be withheld if they do not implement the Australian Government Assessment and Reporting procedures. By what date are State and non-government schools expected to comply with the new assessment and reporting procedures. What is the research base that has been used to inform the development of the five point A-E reporting scale. Is the Minister aware that there is a wealth of research which clearly documents the inadequacies and shortcomings of standardised testing and reporting regimes and their negative effect on student learning and achievement. What measures have been taken by the Government to ascertain the effectiveness, reliability and appropriateness of reporting against a very limited and highly specific five point A-E scale. Is the Minister aware (a) that Victoria is currently implementing an innovative new curriculum, the Victorian Essential Learning Standards, following extensive consultation with, and acceptance by, Victorian School communities and (b) that the Government's assessment and reporting requirements are counter to the flexible assessment principles required by the Victorian Learning Standards that are considered necessary to assure effective learning for every pupil. Is the Minister aware of, and willing to acknowledge, that many teachers, school principals and parent bodies have grave reservations about the impact of the required five point A-E reporting system on student learning and achievement levels. Is the Minister aware that (a) teachers in Victoria are already struggling to do justice to this system and report on just two areas, being Mathematics and English and (b) when all areas of the new Standards have to be reported on, teachers will be required to spend inordinate amounts of time just on meeting the reporting commitments, which will affect the quality of teaching that teachers will be able to deliver. Does the Minister believe that the Government's stated objective of 'plain English reporting' will be achieved when schools will be required to report about Domains, Dimensions, Strands and Progression Points. </title></top>
