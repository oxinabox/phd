 - The issue raised by the Leader of the Opposition is a classic example of how, within the Australian federation at the present time, states are asserting rights but abdicating responsibilities. The Leader of the Opposition is very big on talking about the rights and responsibilities of all sorts of people in the community. I want to talk about both the rights and the responsibilities of states. In advancing this argument, I draw upon the words of the most recently successful Labor leader, Peter Beattie, when he said on the Sunday program that, courtesy of the GST - which he opposed - he had enough money to fund an early childhood education program. The sort of thing that the Leader of the Opposition is speaking about is historically and manifestly a state responsibility. In the GST, we established a method of providing the states with a growth source of revenue. It is the states' responsibility and, unless we are going to tear up the whole federal compact, it is about time the states of this country accepted their responsibility as well as asserting their rights.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question and for the interest he has in the historic free trade agreement that was concluded during the course of last weekend by the Minister for Trade. It was one of the truly great achievements of Australian trade policy. We have made the point on many occasions in government that we pursue foreign and trade policy to advance the national interest, and that includes promoting the security and prosperity of Australia. We see our relationship with the United States - our political relationship, our security relationship, our economic relationship - as not alone in advancing our security and our prosperity but vastly important to them. For example, the ANZUS alliance, which was negotiated by a coalition government back in 1951 - so it is over 50 years old - is fundamental not only to our security but to the security architecture of the Asia-Pacific region.Most recently we have been talking to the Americans about the possibility of expanding their military training programs in Australia and about working with the Americans to develop a missile defence system. With the free trade agreement, this is fundamental to underwriting Australia's prosperity for the future. One of the many arguments in support of the free trade agreement is the growth in the science and technology gap between the United States and the rest of the world. The United States, as someone said the other day, is an innovation engine of unparalleled size. The United States in the year 2000 spent $500 billion on research and development, which is more funding than the next five biggest spenders combined spend on research and development. There have been over 94 Nobel laureates in science since 1990, 68 of those 94 Nobel laureates have lived and worked in the United States; six of them, the second largest number, are in the United Kingdom; and the rest are spread in ones and twos amongst other countries.The point is that, quite apart from the very obvious export benefits that we get from a free trade agreement and the growth in jobs, we are able to dock onto an economy which is the innovation engine of the international community. We could go another way. We could refuse to do that and we could take the position of the Labor Party - completely negative - which says it wants to oppose the free trade agreement and forgo the opportunity of a generation for this country. That kind of anti-Americanism and that kind of negative opportunism do not do our political process or our country any good. The same applies to missile defence. Here is a proposition from the Americans that they would develop a system - with the support of some of their allies, like the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan - which, for example, would be capable of stopping a missile from a hostile power landing on Los Angeles, on San Diego or on one of our allies. The Labor Party's proposition is that we should oppose this and we should say to the Americans, `The one thing as an ally of yours we won't do for you is help to develop a system to stop missiles attacking your cities or allied troops, including our own.' This kind of blind anti-Americanism is something that should have been consigned to the dustbin of history with the Whitlam government. I thought this anti-Americanism went out with the conspiracy theory that the CIA paid Sir John Kerr to throw out Gough Whitlam, but it seems to have re-emerged with the `son of Whitlam' coming forward as the leader of the Labor Party in the same old seat of Werriwa. So you can look to the future, you can build with the innovation economy, you can secure America and its allies in the international community, or you can go the Labor way: the anti-American way; the way of negativism and obstruction.</DOC>

 - I do not think it will come as an absolute thunderclap of surprise to know, given the composition of the Senate committee, that it would make that recommendation. Our position on this is very clear. We already have in operation a very significant increase, via the increase by $5 in the rebate for card holders and for children under the age of 16, and that came into operation on 2 February. I am very pleased to note that the Australian Labor Party on that issue is not going to try and roll that rebate over.I take the opportunity of the Leader of the Opposition's question to engage him for a moment on the wisdom of opposing, as he apparently intends to do, the government's proposal for a safety net. I can accept that the policy of the Labor Party is that, if they were to win government, they would increase the rebate further - that is what they are arguing they are going to do - but I cannot see the logic or the fairness or the sense of, at the same time, blocking the safety net. It appears that the Labor Party's opposition to the safety net is based upon a misapprehension that the safety net only covers out-of-pocket expenses in relation to GPs. In fact, it covers out-of-pocket expenses in relation to specialist consultations and out-of-pocket expenses in relation to many other procedures where the level of bulk-billing is much lower than the level of bulk-billing for GPs, and simultaneously the Labor Party has no proposals to boost bulk-billing in those areas. So it seems to me, as a matter of logic, that there is no inconsistency between supporting the safety net and maintaining the Labor Party's policy on bulk-billing. I can therefore only conclude that the reason that the Labor Party is opposing the safety net is opposition for opposition's sake. Once again, we get this sort of knee-jerk reaction: you oppose something because Howard has put it up, not because it may be intrinsically wrong.In the same way, the Labor Party, for reasons that escape the attention of many independent commentators, is opposing the free trade agreement with the United States. Even the sore pressed sugar industry's CEO, Mr Ballantyne, yesterday issued a press statement which I think struck a high water mark of respect for the national interest. Mr Ballantyne said that, despite the grief of the sugar industry, they accepted that the agreement was in the overall interest of the Australian public. I think that is a wonderful lesson to those who sit opposite. There is no merit in your position in relation to the safety net, and I invite the Leader of the Opposition to join me in passing the safety net. He will have loads of opportunity, if he happens to win, to implement his policy, and he will find the safety net a wonderful addition to his policy armoury. He has no justification on the merits in opposing the safety net. He has all the justification on the basis of old politics in opposing the safety net because it was put forward by the coalition and therefore, ipso facto, it must be bad. I do not think that is the sort of cynicism the people of Australia want. I invite the Leader of the Opposition to change his stance.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. His constituents in the electorate of Grey, and particularly the tuna fishermen, stand to gain significantly from this historic agreement that has been reached with the United States of America. In that negotiation we have been able to remove the 35 per cent tariff on canned tuna getting into the US market. Tomorrow, the member for Grey and I will visit that factory, where they are saying that they will be able to increase their employment by at least 70 people. So the agreement has increased opportunities in international trade for Australia's exporters, which equals new jobs for Australians. This negotiated outcome with the United States is worth billions of dollars for the Australian economy and particularly for rural and regional Australia. We have heard the analogy of the Port Lincoln tuna processors, which is one great example of the opportunities that are going to be available for new jobs there.We are used to the Australian Labor Party being a bit fast and loose with the truth and with their comments, but yesterday an opposition spokesman on ABC radio said that beef farmers are still facing an 18-year wait. That is plainly untrue. It is a falsehood and it should be rejected. Beef producers across Australia can understand exactly what is going to happen. In the first year of entry into force, they will immediately have savings of $22 million just on the tariffs that are being eliminated - something that the Labor Party were never able to achieve while they were in office. That is every year on the existing quota. Over the 18 years that the Australia Labor Party spokesman referred to, that is a $400 million saving just on the abolition of the tariff. But during that time and increasingly right through that period the extra quota will grow to a point where the extra income for the beef industry will be $2.6 billion plus the $400 million saving on tariffs, a $3 billion benefit - and they do not have to wait 18 years for it. It is growing all the way and they can plan their future on what we have negotiated in this agreement with the United States. We should get those facts straight on the record for the Australian public.Across this agreement, we have delivered an open market in the automotive industry, an open market in the services industry and an open market in the horticultural industry. At the same time we have been working very hard to protect those things that are very important to the Australian public such as the national interest test through the Foreign Investment Review Board, the PBS, local content on Australian television and, of course, Australia's single-desk trading arrangement, which the Americans were quite openly after. We protected those and defended those in this agreement. The other thing we protected and agreed not to put in this agreement is the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism - something that every single Labor state Premier said they would not countenance in this agreement. We rejected that in this agreement with the Americans and it is not in there. So we expect to get some support from the states across Australia because that is not in there. The Labor Party should take notice of some of the sound advice being provided by many of the industries in Australia that want this agreement to go ahead and do not want it used as a political football. The press release from the Port Lincoln Tuna Processors says:Regional South Australia cannot afford the FTA to become a political football. It puts at risk jobs, families and the future of the industry trying to improve its global competitiveness.The Australian Labor Party should take notice of the advice that the broader community is providing them because this agreement, this deal, is in the national interest.</DOC>

 - I have not had the opportunity of reading that report. Even on the reading by the shadow minister, the recommendation was that I examine the evidence, not the recommendation you attributed to my colleagues on the committee at the conclusion of your question. As always with a Labor spokesman, I will have a look at what was really said. I will contextualise it. Your strike rate over the last couple of years has been about four out of 10 for getting it right, so I will have a look at it and if I have anything further to say I might do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question. The Australian-United States free trade agreement delivers real benefits to the information and communications technology industry in Australia. It gives our companies greater access to the massive United States govern-ment procurement market - a market that is estimated to be worth more than $64 billion at the federal level alone. It reduces costs for ICT companies dealing with the United States and it substantially increases the attractiveness of Australia as a destination for ICT investment. Under the free trade agreement, Australia will be listed as a designated country under United States law. This means that Australian companies can sell software services and hardware directly to the United States federal government and most state government agencies. Previously, they would have had to have formed a United States subsidiary or to have gone through a partner.Australian companies also now have the opportunity to be listed on the federal supply schedules - the list from which most American government agencies purchase. The substantial benefits of this agreement for the ICT sector have been recognised by Australian companies: for example, the Adelaide based manufacturer of satellite and high-frequency radio telecommunications equipment, Codan, says it stands to gain millions of dollars in revenue each year as a result. In the Herald Sun this morning, the Managing Director of Codan, Mr Mike Heard, was reported as saying:This Free Trade Agreement now means we are on a level playing field with American companies who design and manufacture similar products to ours.Codan is just one example of an Australian company anticipating significant benefits from the FTA. Exports of Australian computer services and information services to the United States grew from $323 million in 1997-98 to $551 million in 2001-02. Given the enhanced access the FTA gives, we can anticipate that this will continue to grow quite dramatically. Other benefits to the ICT industry include the possibility, the potential, for increased United States investment. American companies provided most of the $330 million in new foreign ICT investment in Australia between July and November 2003. Given the harmonisation of intellectual property protections and the overall liberalisation of trade, we can anticipate that there will be growth in US investment in Australia.The government is confident that, given the chance to compete fairly, our vibrant and innovative industry will not only hold its own against United States companies; it will excel. Labor is proposing to strip $140 million from the government investment in the IT sector. While Labor is proposing that, this government is expressing its commitment, through the free trade agreement, to a vibrant and innovative ICT industry in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barton for his question. I can say that I did, on 17 October, make the announcement to which he referred. It was a very substantial announcement. The government agreed to more than $50 million over the next five years to fund the National Threat Assessment Centre, which will bring together the agencies involved in terrorist threat intelligence to work together in a single centre. It makes good sense to have arrangements of that sort. I indicated that it would operate 24 hours a day to identify and issue assessments of threats to Australia.I also made it clear at the time that people should not surmise that, because we saw a need for this centre, ASIO had not been available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The fact is that senior officers have made themselves available to work at very considerable pressure to assist in ensuring that the government was able to get timely advice in relation to matters relevant to our national security. ASIO has a 24-hour a day, seven-day a week duty officer arrangement in place. It also has in place a 24-hour a day, seven-day a week call-on arrangement, including for the communications centre. In relation to the announcement that I made, of course it takes time to recruit additional people and to train those additional people. That is why it is occurring over a time frame. I am advised that the extended hours which will be provided as a result of the announcement that I made on 17 October will in fact commence this month and that 24-hour a day, seven-day a week coverage will be available from early April.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. I can report to the House that the Westpac Melbourne Institute Survey of Consumer Sentiment for the month of February showed that consumer confidence is at the highest level recorded since July 1994. Members of the House will recall that sentiment jumped in 1994 as the Australian economy came out of the worst recession in 60 years. That improved consumer sentiment in this country quite considerably. Consumer sentiment is now 18.6 per cent higher than the level of one year ago, and high consumer confidence is working out in retail sales, which have been strong. I think the House will be interested in this: sales of new motor vehicles in Australia last year were the highest ever recorded - that is, more cars were sold than ever before in Australia. That is because motor cars in Australia are now substantially cheaper than they were before this government reformed the tax system. We took a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax off cars. There is a 10 per cent GST for the consumer, but for business purchasers they are tax free. That was the strongest thing you could possibly have done for the Australian car industry - which would not have been done if the so-called economic spokesman for the Australian Labor Party had had their way.Can I also go on and say, in the context of the free trade agreement, that Australian motor vehicle manufacturers will get an additional benefit out of the free trade agreement, because for the first time they will be getting access to the US utility market, which is tariff free. You might think that the Australian Labor Party would be interested in people who work in the car industry, car sales and car production in the country, but the Australian Labor Party opposed the tax change and opposes the free trade agreement. These are the things that have given the Australian car industry the export impetus that it needed. Indeed, in January, motor vehicle sales topped those of last year. They were higher in January than in the all-time record year of 2003.Economic reform takes leadership. It takes a determination to see a policy through for more than an hour or two. It takes a determination to do those things which are important - whether or not the political wind is blowing for or against them - like supporting the liberalisation of trade and reducing tariff barriers, like balancing budgets, like reforming the tax system, like reducing debt and like keeping interest rates in a framework which keeps the Australian economy strong. This government, over the last eight years, has put all of those things in place without any assistance whatsoever from the Australian Labor Party, which still runs around with its opportunistic position. The Leader of the Opposition was down at the ALP conference extolling his commitment to tariffs! The free trader from Werriwa! - Of course, strong consumer sentiment and strong retail sales are good for the small businesses of the Riverina. There is another thing that is good for the small businesses of the Riverina: their overdraft rates are no longer 22 per cent, as they were in the late 1980s and the 1990s. There is another good thing for the Riverina: unemployment is no longer above 11 per cent in this country, as it was in the early 1990s.Economic policy requires discipline, commitment, purpose, stability and the ability to hold a position longer than the distance from Lateline to lunchtime. That is what this government has been about over the last eight years. Putting into place free trade agreements for the long term is a part of that, and those who are really interested in the welfare of small business and consumers in this country will be supporting the economic reform which is required to ensure it.</DOC>

 - I am aware of those remarks attributed to Mr Hill. I am also aware of the fact that before the military operations commenced there were briefings given to ministers about the possible use of nerve agents and other agents of that kind - mustard gas and the like - and also about the precautions that had been taken to ensure that Australian forces were protected against that. The question asked by the member for Griffith is asked, of course, against the background of the ongoing debate about Australia's involvement in the war against Saddam Hussein. -  - Yes, they do not want to hear about this. I am surprised it has taken until now for the opposition to ask the question. I take the opportunity of repeating that the decision taken by the government was the right decision. It was based on the intelligence available to us at the time. I have no regrets of any description about that decision. I have no doubt that the world and the Middle East and Iraq in particular is a better place because of the removal of Saddam Hussein. It also remains the case that, for all his twists and turns, if the advice of the member for Griffith had been taken Saddam Hussein would still be running Iraq. - That is the uncomfortable truth. No matter what question he asks, no matter what he says, you cannot evade that very uncomfortable truth. -  - Those who condemned us must wear the consequences. But the other point that I make -  - I also take the opportunity to remind the member for Griffith that about a year ago the debate in this parliament was not about whether Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. The member for Griffith believed that, because he said so. The member for Griffith said so; the then Leader of the Opposition said so. - In fact, the debate was not about whether or not Iraq possessed weapons; the debate was about the process that should be followed in order to disarm Iraq. That was the debate, and those who sat opposite were not disputing the existence of weapons of mass destruction; those who sat opposite said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. The then Leader of the Opposition in fact said that Iraq was in material breach of the United Nations resolution, which was of course the legal foundation for the action that we took.  - The debate then was not about whether Iraq had weapons of mass destruction but whether you should go down the French-Russian course, which would have left Saddam Hussein in control and which the Australian Labor Party furiously supported, or whether you should support the coalition led by the United States. That was the divide, and now those who sit opposite opportunistically suggest that the divide was on another ground.The world is better off without Saddam Hussein and those opposite who opposed us must accept the responsibility that, if their advice had been taken, Saddam Hussein would still be running Iraq, he would still be murdering dissidents and there would be more mass graves. You would have the moral responsibility, for having taken that line of argument, to explain it to the Australian people. You were wrong about Iraq. The world is better off as a result of what we did, and this government has nothing to apologise for.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. I know how many of her constituents are very eager to see the passage of the government's MedicarePlus safety net legislation. This government is totally committed to protecting and strengthening Medicare and that means improving Medicare as medical practices change and evolve. Health care today is not just about public hospital stays and GP visits; it is also about radiation therapy, day procedures, visits to specialists and complex scans. None of these services have ever been widely bulk-billed. That is why the new MedicarePlus safety net is an important structural improvement to our whole Medicare system.My department estimates that in the current calendar year 130,000 concession card holders or people with family tax benefits will rack up Medicare Benefits Schedule gap payments in excess of $500 and 40,000 other individuals and families will have gap expenses greater than $1,000 - that is 170,000 individuals and families in Australia who need the benefit of the MedicarePlus safety net. In just the first month of this year, my department advises me, 1,100 individuals and families have already accrued MBS gap payments exceeding $500 and only five per cent of those payments are arising from general practice visits. Every week, every month, that this legislation is not passed means that more Australians are left in the lurch and that is where they have been left by the policies of the Leader of the Opposition.The fourth rung of the Leader of the Opposition's ladder of opportunity was better health care. If the Leader of the Opposition was fair dinkum, he would pass the MedicarePlus safety net legislation. We know he is not fair dinkum because even his rhetoric has been borrowed from someone else. It was actually George Bush who used the phrase `ladder of opportunity' in the Republican Party's 2000 platform, and he had borrowed it from Ronald Reagan, who used it in two State of the Union addresses. - Not only did Ronald Reagan use it in two State of the Union addresses but it seems he borrowed the phrase from Winston Churchill, who said that the role of government was to provide a ladder of opportunity and a safety net of social service. So he is not even a very good plagiarist, because on the other side it was none other than the member for Lilley, that old rooster, who first used the phrase `ladder of opportunity' in a press release that he put out in January last year. You old plagiarist - you are not a new leader; you are an old plagiarist. - Mr Speaker, if the Labor Party does not support the MedicarePlus safety net legislation, the member for Werriwa will not be in favour of a ladder of opportunity for the Australian people; he will be practising a ladder of opportunism for himself.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government very closely and very fully examined Sydney's airport needs some time ago. I have to say that even while fully maintaining the curfew, the 18 movements per hour cap, the noise-sharing arrangements and full regional access - something the government is very deeply committed to - the fact is that the airport will plainly carry Sydney's airport needs for many years into the future. The position is simple: Sydney will not need a second airport in the foreseeable future. Indeed, any attempt to identify a site at this point in time would be fraught with difficulties in establishing the real parameters, the real needs and the real solution, because there is not a problem.I am asked about alternative policies. I have to say at the outset that you have to track through the record of Labor's policy making to try to understand the alternative policy position, but I will give it a go. As we know, the present Leader of the Opposition has been a very long-term advocate of building a second airport at Badgerys Creek. He started to advocate it in 1987. He was then newly a member of the Liverpool council. He continued it when he became the mayor and then the chairman of the local Wesroc in 1991. He was a staunch advocate of it when he became the member for Werriwa, and he continued to be so as a junior shadow minister. In fact, he was a staunch advocate for Badgerys Creek for the first 16 years of his time in public life. That was right up until the time he was promoted to shadow Treasurer, when all of a sudden the former Leader of the Opposition announced a new Labor policy: they would not build a second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek. They said that they would set up a committee to find a new site within the Sydney basin. That committee consisted of the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hotham; the transport spokesman, the member for Batman - it is good to see him here; the members for Grayndler and Barton; and Senator Faulkner. It also included the newly promoted and former Badgerys champion, the member for Werriwa.I thought, `Well, this will be good.' I have always been prepared to be open and transparent, and I thought they would soon come along to the department for a full briefing. This issue has had a long history; it goes back a long way. We have rooms full of information. I thought they would like to at least look at some of the material that we have on the environmental impact statements that have been done over the years, but I did not hear from them. Then I thought we would see some media reports of site inspections and community consultations, but they do not seem to have happened either. Then you would think that there would have been a definitive report at some stage, but that did not happen either. In fact, I cannot find any evidence that that committee did anything at all. I do not believe that it did anything at all.What did happen was that the new Leader of the Opposition suddenly announced - wait for it - that there was no suitable site in the Sydney basin, so the second Sydney airport would have to be built elsewhere. Then we had reports leaked from the Labor Party that the site would be Wilton. But there were some protests about that from the Labor candidate for Cunningham. He cut up so rough that the opposition leader said: `No, Wilton is off the list. It won't be Wilton.' Then he promised that the site would be announced at the ALP conference, but it was not announced at the ALP conference. Finally -  -  - Has the site been announced? Did we miss something? Did you announce the site at the conference? - Of course, that is not what happened. There was no announcement. Finally, we are assured that the new policy was carefully worked through with the New South Wales government.  - It was! How come Premier Carr said he did not know anything about it? The New South Wales Minister for Regional Development and the Minister for the Illawarra, David Campbell, said he played no part in the decision and that his federal colleagues did not consult him. So we are left with Labor's idea of a clear and concise policy. Somewhere in the future, they are going to build an airport that airlines do not want to use for an overflow of air traffic that does not exist in an area somewhere south of the Nepean River where no-one wants it. But they still say it will not be a white elephant.</DOC>

 - In response to the honourable member's question: I did not get an opportunity to see the article that he referred to in the Washington Post. What I will say with regard to the comparison between the Australia-US free trade agreement and those others that he referred to is that ours is an agreement between two highly competitive and developed countries. It delivers significant opportunities to our agricultural exports in Australia. The most important and salient point to make when comparing what we have agreed to and what was agreed to with CAFTA is that the ultimate test in getting delivery of the benefits of these agreements is to get them approved by Congress. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. Most members of this House would be aware of the disastrous and retrograde workplace relations platform that Mr Latham and the Labor Party approved at their national conference just two weeks ago.  - This platform includes an attack on casual employment, which will hurt Australia's 1.1 million small businesses and the 3.5 million workers who work in them. This is a crazy job-destroying plan from the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party and it shows their inability to act in the interests of all Australians. What Mr Latham and the Labor Party have conveniently forgotten is that the growth in casual employment under this government has slowed compared to the rate of growth under the previous Labor government. In fact a resurgence of growth in permanent employment has been a feature of this government. In the past year alone eight out of 10 jobs created in Australia have been permanent jobs. The Labor Party plan would particularly hurt young people, who make use of casual employment -  - as well as women, as the Prime Minister indicates, particularly those returning to the work force. The reality is that the vast majority of casual workers receive a loading to compensate them for the lack of leave entitlements - usually between 20 and 25 per cent above the existing hourly rate. That is something which would be abolished if the Labor Party's proposal were adopted. Recently the respected commentator Greg Hywood stated: Reducing flexibility and increasing employer costs - intervention of the type proposed by Emerson - is only likely to destroy jobs and limit wealth creation. We should not be fooled. The Labor plan is not about good policy. It is not about assisting ordinary Australians to gain employment or even about increasing real wages. It is about Labor delivering to its union mates. This plan to re-regulate proves once again that the Labor Party is a wholly owned subsidiary of the big unions in Australia. In fact the Labor Party spokesman, the member for Rankin, said at the national conference of the ALP, `The Labor Party and the unions are in partnership once again.' We know that in the past Mr Latham, the Leader of the Opposition, has expressed vigorously his disillusionment with the union movement, but this appears now to have changed. In a Daily Telegraph article on 23 December 1998 the member for Werriwa wrote this: The union movement needs to find a way of becoming relevant, otherwise it runs the risk of becoming yet another dinosaur of the industrial age. It is these very same union bosses that the Labor leader now takes his marching orders from, and this is where we see policy supporting them. Why? It is because the unions are the financial masters of the Australian Labor Party. Last week it was revealed that since 1995-96 the unions have donated almost $40 million to the Australian Labor Party. The reality is that, in the last financial year alone, $5 million has been donated by big union bosses and the unions to the Australian Labor Party. The Leader of the Opposition should show some intellectual integrity about this: either the unions are the industrial dinosaurs - which he pointed out vigorously in the past - or they are what his policies now show; that is, the owners and the operators of the Australian Labor Party. The member for Werriwa has sold out Australian workers. He has sold out his principles to the union masters and he has sold out Australia's national interests. If he had some real courage of his convictions he would stand up for what he said in the past rather than selling them out. The Daily Telegraph article of 23 December 1998 that I quoted from is, not surprisingly, one of the stories that the member for Werriwa has attempted to hide from the public by expunging and erasing his web sites. The member for Werriwa says that he is in favour of honesty and integrity and transparency.  - As I was saying, in conclusion, the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa, has said on numerous occasions that he stands for honesty, integrity, transparency and, dare I say it, Internet democracy in politics, yet he has expunged from his web sites, and other web sites as well, reams and reams of his past material. - In conclusion: no wonder Mr Flip-Flop is trying to erase his past!</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The first point to make, obviously, is that, as has been stated on a number of occasions yesterday and today, agriculture is not excluded from this deal. On entry into force, 66 per cent of agricultural tariffs will be eliminated. There will be a further nine per cent of agricultural tariffs eliminated after four years after it enters into force.I am well aware of what the IMF has said. I will read something back to you in a moment that the IMF has said. But the litmus test on this is the WTO. As I said yesterday, under provisions of the WTO, these free trade agreements are legal. They are legal to be addressed in the way that we have. The member referred to an IMF report, but he did not read out the other interesting point in terms of this FTA. I will read it:The IMF modelling results do not account for the benefits generated by increased trade in services and investment.The IMF paper itself concedes that these areas could be key in determining the overall appeal of an FTA. What is one of our largest growth sectors in exports? Services. What is one of the largest growth areas in the United States? Services and investment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question. I note that the recent ACCI and Sensis surveys found that Australia's 1.1 million small businesses have strong business confidence. They are very positive about the next 12 months. In fact, in the recently released National Business Bulletin, it was found that 89 per cent of small business operators felt that their businesses were in a better financial position than in the previous year. The key reason for the high level of support identified by the businesses in this survey is that this federal government - the coalition government - supports the interests of small business. They feel that we have created a stable economic and business environment supported by sound policy decisions. We agree with that. We think that is quite true.So I was alarmed to see that the Labor Party at its recent national conference had decided to turn the clock back to old Labor with the most threatening workplace relations initiatives since those of the Whitlam government. The first initiative is that of forcing small businesses to re-employ on a part-time basis, if the employee so chooses, people who have been on maternity leave and were previously employed on a full-time basis. The implications of that initiative for small businesses in regional and remote parts of the country where they have very limited access to a skills base is enormous.The second initiative - get a load of this! - is that union officials will have a right of access to all workplaces for the purposes of communication, organisation, recruitment and assistance to workers. There are 800,000 small businesses that operate from home. Under the Labor Party's platform, union officials will be able to access those homes to recruit union members. There is no exemption for home based businesses - it is in black and white. Of course the Labor Party is on a membership drive. The member for Werriwa - in the forgotten days - said that `featherbedding union interests can only be funded at public cost'. We know what the public cost is. You would have thought that the Labor Party would be in a listening mode. Their leader talks about community consultation. I happen to have received a piece of community consultation sent to the opposition workplace relations spokesperson, Craig Emerson -  - the member for Rankin. It comes from the Combined Small Business Alliance of Western Australia, representing 29 chambers of commerce. The chief executive officer says to the Labor Party:Your proposals demonstrate a complete lack of understanding of small business and the burdens placed upon us by Labor governments, which in their election platforms commit to `looking after' small business, rhetorically espousing the significance of small business with the catchcry that small business is the engine room of the economy.He goes on to say:History clearly records that Labor governments, once elected, commence with kicking small business in the guts and don't stop until they're thrown out.If nothing else, we commend the Labor Party for its forthright honesty in being consistent by committing to start kicking small business if elected to government. If the Labor leader believes that he should be listening to the community, then he should listen to the small business constituency - the 1.1 million voices out there - because, as they know and as we know, it is not new Labor; it is old Labor and old policies.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Ryan for his question. Obviously the government is very concerned to ensure the protection of the Australian community through identification and proscribing of organisations that clearly have terrorist links. The government has taken action to make it an offence to belong to or raise funds for those organisations, because that is clearly in Australia's national interest. However, there are some impediments that remain to a process which can ensure that that proscription can occur swiftly. The main impediment has been the delays that have been caused by the unwillingness of the Labor Party to give the government of the day the appropriate power to make regulations to list organisations under the Criminal Code. This has been going on for some two years. The process is cumbersome, but I noted that the opposition was very intransigent in relation to these matters. Its then spokesman, Senator Faulkner, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, in a speech called `Labor's consistent fight for security and freedom of Australia', said:Most importantly, we have ensured the government's proposal to give the Attorney-General power to ban organisations never sees the light of day.I was interested that there appeared to be emerging a new approach. I understand that at the conference of the Labor Party the new leader had this to say:Protecting Australia's national security is the first and final responsibility of an Australian government.He went on to say:When I have to make a decision on Australia's national security, I will ask only one question: what is in Australia's national interest?And I hear that. I am interested, because I have been corresponding with the shadow minister, that he issued a statement, dated 9 February, indicating that Labor approves safeguards on proscription power. I have not seen the detail of his response, but I notice that there is one paragraph which demonstrates that the Labor Party has not changed at all in relation to this matter, because he says:In approving of the safeguards, caucus noted the inherent unreliability of primary intelligence material and confirmed that a Labor government would introduce a court based model of listing terrorist organisations.It is clearly another flip-flop. Certainly the Labor Party has walked away from the leader's comments about the national interest being put first.</DOC>

 - It is my understanding that the Commonwealth has met its obligations under the claim support scheme which was put in place for HIH. Under that scheme, the Commonwealth guaranteed people who were subject to payouts or ongoing income support in respect of personal injury, it guaranteed small business up to certain limits and it guaranteed other people, but we did not guarantee 100 per cent of all claims - of all entitlements. The reason that was done was that, particularly in relation to those who had a commercial claim of one kind or another, we felt that it would be an unacceptable moral hazard for an underwriting program to come in and pay 100 per cent of all claims. That is why we put that in place. I believe that the Commonwealth has met its obligations. If there is a suggestion, in relation to this particular claim, that it has not then I welcome the member sending me the particulars of that claim but, as far as I know, the Commonwealth has met all of the obligations that it undertook, bearing in mind that we did not undertake for 100 per cent payout in all cases of all commercial losses.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for his question and not only his interest but his strong support for the historic free trade agreement with the United States. This is an agreement that has been welcomed by the overwhelming majority of peak business bodies and a wide range of sectoral industry associations. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that the free trade agreement was:... a high-quality agreement which benefits the whole Australian economy, including the manufacturing, services, agricultural, mining and investment sectors.The President of the Business Council of Australia said it `will provide massive opportunities for Australian companies of all sizes to gain access to the world's largest market'. The Australian Industry Group said that it is going to have a lobbying campaign both in Australia and, importantly, in the United States explaining to all sides of politics the anticipated benefits of the agreement. I think they will have a fair bit of work to do with the other side of the House. The chief executive said: ... we cannot underestimate the potential benefits of better access to our second largest export market after Japan and the primary source of Australia's Foreign Direct Investment.Holden's managing director, Denny Mooney, said the agreement will provide increased opportunities in vehicles and components while flow-on effects of stronger economic growth will benefit the entire industry. The Minerals Council of Australia said that the free trade agreement `is just the fillip the Australian minerals industry is looking for from these trade negotiations'. The horticultural industry, through Horticultural Australia, considers the agreement would deliver very substantial benefits to the industry. Instead of two per cent in value of fresh Australian horticultural exports entering the US tariff free, which is the case at the moment - and therefore, of course, is Labor's policy - 100 per cent will have zero tariffs. The wine industry supports the deal. The Australian Seafood Industry Council has said that benefits of the deal will be felt right across the Australian seafood sector. The National Farmers Federation has pointed out the market access gains for agricultural industries, including dairy, beef, horticulture, sheep, meat and wool. This is a pretty broad cross-section of industries throughout Australia. As far as we can make out, the only people who stand against this commonsense, logical and visionary free trade agreement are the Australian Council of Trade Unions, who are against any kind of reform whatsoever, and their servants here in the federal parliament, the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lilley, and I remind him that the government's third term, let alone fourth term, still has a considerable time to run. I remind him that this government, in the time it has been in government, has provided substantial increases in assistance to help people balance work and family. The greatest thing you can do for any family is to give its members the opportunity of employment. I note from today's unemployment figures that unemployment remains below six per cent at 5.7 per cent, compared with the 8.5 per cent that this government inherited when it came to office in 1996. We have improved the access and affordability of child care. We have provided 200,000 additional places since 1996. There are now over half a million child-care places. In December 2003, we announced an additional $79.5 million for 10,000 more places in outside school hours care and vacation care, an additional 2,500 family day care places and funding for an additional 4,000 playgroups. ABS data shows that, at June 2002, for 38 per cent of all families using formal day care the net cost was less than $20 a week. It remains the case that the government has some other options under consideration and, if they are chosen by the government, further statements will be made.  - It was marked confidential. - I was reading from a document marked confidential.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to tell the member for Parkes that there will be very substantial benefits to Australian farmers from the free trade agreement. Over recent days there has been quite a lot of attention given to the enormous gains to the dairy industry and the beef industry. They are significant - of the order of $1.5 billion for the dairy industry over 20 years and at least $2.5 billion for the beef industry over that period. I think it is appropriate that such attention has been given to those industries, because they were particularly difficult areas - areas where the United States has great sensitivities and where our Minister for Trade has been able to negotiate a very significant improvement in Australian access. That will mean real benefits for those two great Australian industries. For the dairy industry in particular, most of those benefits are in year 1. They start right from the beginning, so we will have much improved access in that regard.But there are a range of other producers who will also do very well out of the free trade agreement. Around 21,000 Australian horticultural producers will benefit from immediate tariff elimination for oranges, mangoes, mandarins, strawberries, fresh tomatoes, cut flowers, olives, fresh macadamias and a range of other products. Avocado producers will have a quota of 4,000 tonnes into the United States market. We need to put that into some kind of perspective. The total production of avocados in Australia is only 28,000 tonnes and our exports last year totalled about 440 tonnes. Now there will be access for 4,000 tonnes of avocados into the United States - across the seasons, I might add, and not exclusively reserved to one time, as some on the opposite side have been falsely claiming. For the first time, for some Australian peanuts there will be free and open access to the United States market. The significance of this needs to be recognised. It may surprise the House to know that currently the tariffs on Australian peanuts, if they were to go to the United States, would range between 132 per cent and 164 per cent. Now we will move towards free access for some Australian peanuts. What is Labor's response? Do they want our peanuts to go to the United States without a tariff or do they want us to pay a 132 to 164 per cent tariff? Clearly, no peanuts will go to the United States when those sorts of tariff measures are in place.The US is the most important of our wine markets. It is now our biggest market. Tariffs will be phased out, which will be of great benefit to that enormous industry. Forty-eight tariffs will be removed immediately from Australian seafood exports to the United States. That is a $12 billion market. Those tariffs, ranging between six per cent and 35 per cent, will be eliminated immediately, opening up a whole range of new opportunities for our seafood producers. Honourable members will remember the trouble we had with our lamb exports and the tariffs that were placed on those exports. They will also disappear. So we will have the complete elimination of all tariffs on lamb and mutton, worth about $1.5 million every year to our industry.An incident having occurred in the gallery -  -  - For the wool producers there will be an elimination of the tariff, worth 18.7c per kilogram. That tariff will be gone. It will be worth over $1 million a year to the industry. These are very significant benefits to Australian producers, but Labor would have us make no gains at all for our primary producers. They want to keep all those tariffs, keep all those barriers and lock Australia's industry into a limited potential.</DOC>

 - The practice of government is not to comment on the contents of particular documents or whether they do or do not come to cabinet. - Seeing as the member for Lilley has asked me a question about the benefits that have been provided by this government to families with children since it has been in office, I take the opportunity to draw on some analysis published by that most impeccable of all economic sources, the Commonwealth Treasury.It published an analysis comparing the real disposable incomes of Australians before the new tax system was introduced and about one year afterwards. Do you know what that analysis found, Mr Speaker? It found that all family types had a greater disposable income 12 months after the introduction of tax reform. This is not myth; this is fact. The increase in real disposable income was generally significantly higher for couples with children and sole parents than for households without children, and that is as it should be. The analysis found that between the years 1999 and 2001 couples with two children in the bottom income quintile received a real increase in average weekly disposable income of $36. Couples with children in the second bottom quintile received a real increase of $51 a week. Couples with children in the top income quintile received an average increase in real disposable income of $32 a week, and sole parents, across all income quintiles, received an average real increase of between $34 and $46 a week. But there was one thing that the Treasury analysis did not contain - which is only proper for an apolitical Commonwealth government department - and that is the observation that if the Australian Labor Party had had its way none of these increases would have occurred.</DOC>

 - Today, the labour force figures were released, showing that in the month of January 13,900 new jobs were created in Australia. I know the member for Herbert will be interested to hear that - 13,900 new jobs were created in Australia. Interestingly enough, the number of full-time jobs which were created in Australia in the month was 29,900 - nearly 30,000 new full-time jobs in the month of January. In terms of the unemployment rate, which moved to 5.7 per cent - marginally above the 22-year low of 5.6 per cent - this was the sixth consecutive month where the unemployment rate has been below six per cent. It now looks in a trend sense as if unemployment has moved down below that six per cent notch.The House might be interested to know that in the last six months there seems to have been a pick-up in full-time job creation in Australia. In the last six months there have been 169,000 new full-time jobs created in Australia, which, as the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations pointed out today, is a larger number of net full-time jobs created in the last six months than were created in the last six years of Labor government, from March 1990 to March 1996. A total of 169,000 full-time jobs were created in the last six months and that is, in net terms, greater than the number of full-time jobs created in the last six years of Labor government, from March 1990 to March 1996.It is worth reminding new members of the House as to how bad Labor was when it was in government, because one forgets to compare and contrast in terms of how much damage the 1990 recession did to this country. The teenage unemployment rate has fallen, and I point out that the strong job creation has also been at a time when Australia has been reducing tariffs and liberalising its trade. So what can we do to create further employment opportunities in Australia? We have to maintain the course of liberalising our trade. To turn back now to the path of tariffs - like the member for Werriwa wants to do - or to turn back on the free trade agreement would be to turn back on those things that have contributed to Australia's strength over recent years. We have to maintain a disciplined economic position. We have to keep our budget in balance. We need to reform our labour market, and we need to take structural change into the labour market if we are going to take that rate down further. Disability pension reform, welfare reform, the big structural reforms in industrial relations - these are the things that will give young Australians greater opportunities in the future. These are the things of a disciplined and consistent economic policy, and these are the things that the government will continue to work on. </DOC>

 - I have already indicated my view in relation to comments about documents that may or may not come to cabinet. The member for Lilley in the course of asking his question has raised the issue, as he has in the past, of effective marginal tax rates. Let me point out to the member for Lilley a few salient points about effective marginal tax rates. They have been part and parcel of Australia's family payments system. In fact, they were more sharply emphasised under the former government because of the practice of the former social security minister, Brian Howe, of more tightly targeting social welfare support. I am not saying that that was necessarily wrong; I am simply making that observation. And the member for Batman nods assent to that, which I appreciate very much. The purpose of that was to target assistance to those families who needed it most, and that is low-income families. Withdrawing benefits from families on higher incomes helps to limit the cost to taxpayers generally of funding family assistance.High effective marginal tax rates were a feature of the tax and welfare system under the former government. Many families under the former government faced EMTRs of over 85c in the dollar. In fact, a recent report by NATSEM found that EMTRs faced by individuals in 2002 - that is the year that I think the member referred to in his question - had an overall average the same as in 1994; that is, 29 per cent. In 2002, 24 per cent of individuals had zero EMTRs, 71 per cent had EMTRs of less than 40 per cent and only eight per cent of individuals had EMTRs of greater than 60 per cent. The government did reduce EMTRs for many families as part of a new tax system. The level of assistance under the family tax benefit was increased and take-up rates were reduced.The honourable member referred to the position of single-income families. The level of assistance given by this government to single-income families has been unprecedented. In fact, the situation for single-income families with one child under the age of five years and with a family income of up to about $60,000 to $65,000 a year is equivalent to those families having been given the full benefit of income splitting, which is a measure of the generosity. It stands to reason that, if you significantly reduce the level of tax for single-income families, there is a change when the family ceases to be a single-income family, but it does not in any way diminish the reality that, overall under this government, families have been massively advantaged. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question and for his strong support for the historic free trade agreement with the United States. Not surprisingly, around the region and beyond there has been a great deal of interest in the free trade agreement that Australia has negotiated with the United States. After all, here is a free trade agreement between two of the world's most dynamic economies. I was pleased to see that my New Zealand counterpart and friend, Phil Gough, congratulated Australia on the agreement. He argued that there would be spin-offs from this for New Zealand, and I am sure there will be. There was also a very positive early reaction from prominent regional business groups, not least the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which also believes that there will be benefits in this for the Indonesians.It is easy to see why there is such interest. Many in the region and elsewhere want greater access to the United States market. Thailand, for example, wants a free trade agreement with the United States, and it will commence negotiations with the United States later this year. We all know that New Zealand wants one. The United States concluded a free trade agreement last year, I think, with Singapore. The United States has a very important free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, and it also has free trade agreements with countries like Israel, Jordan, Chile and Costa Rica. There are other countries - quite a long list of countries - that are looking to enter into negotiations over the next few years for a free trade agreement with the United States. It is interesting that the United States and the ASEAN countries are also discussing closer economic relations and ways they can gradually liberalise trade between them.The point I make is this: if you are, like the Australian Labor Party, an opponent of a free trade agreement with the United States, you have to remember one thing - that is, a lot of other countries are doing them. Those other countries that are doing them, if we do not, get a competitive advantage in the American market over us. The Chilean business sector and Chilean agriculture will have preferential access into the American market. We will lose that access if we do not negotiate a free trade agreement with the United States. So there is a real opportunity cost if this country were to follow Labor's policy and oppose a free trade agreement with the United States.I must say, talking of the Labor Party, it is interesting that they supported the free trade agreement with New Zealand, they support a free trade agreement with Singapore, they support one with Thailand, but they do not support one with the United States. I have tried to check - the computers in Parliament House have been down for the last couple of days - but I believe that not a single question has been asked in the House of Representatives by the Labor Party about the free trade agreements with Singapore and Thailand. Not one. Stranger still, on 4 July 2000, an appropriate date perhaps, the Leader of the Opposition told the Economic Society of Australia about his enthusiasm for the `third way' - and I think honourable members will remember what the third way is - praising `Bill Clinton's leadership of APEC and the NAFTA as an `agenda for more effective governance.' Here is a curious thing that the Australian public will I think focus on. The Leader of the Opposition supports a free trade agreement between Canada and the United States but opposes one between Australia and the United States.  - I am referring to Canada. The Australian Labor Party is happy to see Canada benefit from a free trade agreement with the United States but is not happy to see Australia benefit from a free trade agreement with the United States. I think this takes anti-Americanism to a new level. This is another example of the Labor Party on this issue, to use an Australianism, being right out there.</DOC>

 - I have been asked many questions about the issue of paid maternity leave. I think there is an argument for it, but I do not, quite frankly, regard paid maternity leave as being the single most important thing that needs to be done in the work and family area. I think its benefits are limited and quite illusory. In those circumstances I do not share the view, which has apparently become doctrine in the ranks opposite, that all you have to do is introduce something with the name `paid maternity leave' wrapped around it.The government's policy in these areas, as in areas such as education and health, is to provide Australians with choices. We do not mandate a particular pattern of family behaviour. It is not our view that people having had a child should return to work as soon as possible if they do not want to. Those who most zealously advocate paid maternity leave, in my view, evince a society where there is a limit to the choices that are available to women, whereas we support a society where you have the maximum advantages available to Australian mothers and Australian families. The attitude of the Labor Party in this area is of a piece with the attitude of the Labor Party in the areas of both health and education. In the area of health they believe in destroying the private system in order to add to the public system, and in the area of education, if they were given their opportunity, they would undermine the decades-long support for a dual system of education. Their proposals to transfer money from so-called rich schools is the thin end of the wedge to implement the policy of the Australian Education Union to diminish support for all independent schools and to re-establish the pre-eminence of the public system.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Paterson for his question. I have seen reports about proposals to change income tax at levels up to $75,000. According to an article in today's Australian Financial Review, leaked documents reveal that the Labor Party has asked the Labor research firm Access Economics to model options for income tax cuts, including lifting the top income tax threshold to $75,000. Members of this House will recall that this government introduced a bill to do precisely that in July 2000. That bill was opposed by the Australian Labor Party, led by the member for Hotham and supported by the member for Werriwa, on the grounds that it was fiscally profligate and was giving tax cuts to the rich. That was then. Last year when he became shadow Treasurer, the member for Werriwa supported lifting the threshold again. It was part of his attack which ultimately brought down the previous Leader of the Opposition, where he told the Sydney Morning Herald that the threshold should be pushed up because people on $60,000, $70,000 or $80,000 had a problem with their tax. Then after I raised that point in the House he went against this proposal again. He came into the House and said that when he was speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald about this he was not putting forward a policy, just identifying a problem. He was at that point opposed to it. Now he is in favour of it again, because he has commissioned Access Economics to model it. He opposed it, he supported it; he opposed it, he supported it. He flipped, he flopped; he flipped, he flopped. Is it Lateline or lunchtime, lunchtime or Lateline? He has got my head spinning. It is spinning around and around. But, however much my head spins, it does not spin as much as his does. It depends on the day concerned as to where the policy is. When you are making tax policy, you cannot have one policy at 11 p.m. one night and a different one by lunchtime the next day. Negative gearing was going to be abolished on Lateline; it was back by lunchtime. Economic policy takes some consistency of purpose: the purpose of balancing budgets, the purpose of reforming taxation, the purpose of improving industrial relations and the purpose of disciplined and stable government. That is what is represented by the coalition and not by the Labor Party and this Leader of the Opposition. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question. The member has asked whether or not there would be any impact on the courts if the Pacific solution were ended and unauthorised arrivals were brought to Australia. There is a very simple answer to that question. The answer is: yes, it would have a significant impact. I am sure honourable members opposite will recall that, when we sought to provide in the Migration Act the capacity to remove people from Nauru and to have them transit Australia for the purpose of going home, they added a provision that if those people remained for over six months in Australia they would have access to the Refugee Review Tribunal. That means that, if you were to end the Pacific solution and bring people to Australia and they continued to refuse to cooperate in returning home, inevitably they would be here for six months and inevitably thereafter they would be taking every other opportunity, as all other asylum seekers and rejected asylum seekers have done, to access our courts. Migration matters have of course added very considerably to the workload of the High Court. For instance, 82 per cent of matters filed in the High Court today are migration matters, up from 41 per cent previously. This issue goes much wider than just covering the people currently on Nauru, because the Labor Party is talking about ending offshore processing altogether. What that means is that inevitably people would be coming to Australia. We know that because, notwithstanding the areas in which we have been very successful - securing over 200 prosecutions of people smugglers - it had not effectively ended the transit of people to Australia if they thought they would get a benefit from doing so. What Labor said in relation to the most recent boat arrival, the Menasa Bone, is that it would have brought those people to Australia and it would have ensured that they were here ostensibly on the basis that they were going to give evidence to prosecute people smugglers, knowing that prosecuting people smugglers alone has not had any impact on the psyche of those who are seeking to come to Australia.In fact, what we do know is that the strongest message that has ever been given was the message to turn around boats. In an interview on SBS radio in July 2000, one of the most notorious - and now prosecuted - people smugglers, Mr Keis Asfoor, had this to say: If Australia closes the door and turn back one time a ship, the day a ship is turned back I will stop this thing.That was very clear. Labor, of course, wants to change the other aspects of policy. It wants to unwind the TPV regime. It wants to unwind aspects of the detention arrangements. It is quite clear that Labor does have an alternative policy. It ought to own up to it as being the policy of `meet and greet' in relation to unlawfuls. Its aspect of policy is to unwind the measures that have worked and to ensure that people come back to Australia on boats again.</DOC>

 - The member for Lilley has already asked a series of questions and I simply indicate that I do not confirm or deny any receipt of documents or commissioning of documents. I might remind the member for Lilley that, under this government, as I indicated earlier, child care has become not only more plentiful but also more affordable. The number of child-care places has increased by 200,000. The total number is now more than 500,000. Contrary to the predictions made by the Australian Labor Party when the new taxation system was introduced, the cost of child care in this country actually fell. In December of last year, there was an increase of 10,000 in the allocation for family day care places. So the allegations made by the member for Lilley are not right.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. I can indicate to him and to the House that more than 430,000 Australian workplace agreements have been approved since the establishment of the Employment Advocate. These agreements give both employees and employers both choice and flexibility in setting -  - I will say it again. These Australian workplace agreements give both employees and employers choice and flexibility in terms of setting wages and workplace conditions. In fact, this has been a major factor in the creation of some 1.3 million jobs, and real wage increases of over 13 per cent. Now we find out that the policy platform of the Australian Labor Party is to abolish Australian workplace agreements and to abolish the Office of the Employment Advocate. What they want to do is re-regulate the bargaining process and, in the process of that, give a privileged position to the union bosses at the expense of ordinary Australian workers. The Labor Party is proposing to attack 430,000 Australians and their families who have chosen to use Australian workplace agreements. This is a crazy plan which will be a disaster for Australian workers and their families. It is a plan to cost jobs. This has not always been the position of the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa. Indeed, when he was a Liverpool councillor in the early 1990s, according to a report in the Liverpool Leader, the now Leader of the Opposition `pursued management and workplace reforms with zeal and frantic pace'. So why do we have this flip-flop now from the member for Werriwa, the Leader of the Opposition? There are 40 million reasons why we have this flip-flop - $40 million donated by the big unions in Australia to the Australian Labor Party. That is the 40 million reasons for this flip-flop. This is coming from a Leader of the Opposition who in the past has described the union movement as industrial dinosaurs.In a major speech which the Leader of the Opposition made back in 1998, he talked about this sort of opposition policy. He was talking about the Australian Labor Party and he said:This is an opposition which sees its role as exploiting the change process. It tries to feed off the discomfort governments inevitably encounter in having to manage the consequences of economic and social change. It constantly tries to lift the scab off the wounds of change ... Since 1996, federal Labor has been in scab-lifter mode ... this approach sits easily with the political background of Labor's inner circle, comprising ex ALP State secretaries and ex union secretaries. The State secretaries know of no other politics than scab lifting ... Each is comfortable with the critique of economic rationalism - a belief that economic reform is contrary to society's best interests.This attitude to scab lifting which he criticised on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, which he is now leading, is of course the policy that the Leader of the Opposition is now adopting. The bankruptcy of this approach was revealed once again today in an editorial in the Australian newspaper, which said in part:Whether it is a management misjudgment or a cynical exercise in spin, this decision runs counter to Mr Latham's previous strategy of communicating directly with the people.What they were talking about was that the speech that the Leader of the Opposition gave in the past, the purport of which was that political courage beats Labor scab lifting, is one of the reams of speeches and media releases that the Leader of the Opposition has now expunged from his web site. He cannot be trusted. The Leader of the Opposition could not be trusted to keep his promises in the past; he cannot be trusted to keep his promises in the future. For the purpose of the House, I table the speech.</DOC>

 - Let me point out to the Leader of the Opposition that - leaving aside his assertions or anybody else's assertions - there are a number of tests in relation to the matters he raised. That is what has happened. The truth is that unemployment in Australia is now at a 22-year low. The truth is that for the first time in 35 years we have an unemployment rate below six per cent and an inflation rate below three per cent. The truth is that the long-term unemployment rate as measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics is dramatically lower than what it was under the former government. The truth is that ABS data showed that unmet demand for child-care places has fallen since this government came to office. The percentage of children requiring additional formal care fell from 8.4 per cent in March 1996 to 5.6 per cent in June 2002. In absolute numbers, there was a fall in the number of children requiring additional formal care from 261,700 in March 1996 to 174,500 in June 2002. The truth is that through the child-care benefit payment introduced with the tax reform package in 2000 we have increased assistance with child-care costs significantly. The latest available figures show families receive an average CCB payment of nearly $2,000 a year. And, as I said earlier, the most recent ABS figures show that for 38 per cent of all families using formal care the net cost of care was less than $20 a week.This government has made a record allocation of about $8 billion for child care for the next four years, and the government spent more than $7 billion on child care in its first six years of office. That is 70 per cent more than was spent on child care over the last six years of Labor's time in office. They are the facts. Work and family policy is, of course, a continuum. What those figures demonstrate is that since this government came to office there has been a continuous increase in the level of assistance. The figures demonstrate, as well as the tax benefits introduced with the new taxation system, just how much this government has rebalanced work and family and how many more opportunities we have provided. The most dramatic illustration is to be found in the employment figures that were released today. The Leader of the Opposition asked about incentives to move from welfare to work. - It stands to reason that if unemployment is falling there cannot be too many disincentives to move from welfare to work.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note his very real interest in this. I note too that there seems to be something about Labor parties and airports. Last month the ACT government announced that it would build a prison in Hume in the south of Canberra - and I know this is of real concern to the member who asked the question. The Chief Minister, Mr Stanhope, conceded that this was a second-best site, but went on to say that the territory had only chosen it because the Australian government had refused to sell the ACT a site on Defence land near Canberra airport. The Chief Minister is dead wrong, and he must know it.The Australian government has never ruled out transferring part of the Defence land near the airport to the ACT. All we have asked, perfectly reasonably, is for the ACT to wait until we have seen, through a review process that will be completed this year, how much of the Defence land will be needed - wait for it! - to support Canberra's air transport needs beyond the 20-year timetable set out in its master plan. And the Chief Minister himself has in fact conceded the point. But, as I wrote to the Chief Minister: I am hopeful that long-term land-use planning strategies can be identified - that allow for both - that concurrently protect the operational integrity of Canberra Airport and meet the ACT Government's needs.As I said, that will be completed over the next few months. All the Chief Minister and his government need to do here is to wait and see if a site on Defence land near the airport becomes available. I see that one of Mr Stanhope's backbenchers has accused the Australian government - and this is breathtaking - of putting the commercial interests of Canberra airport ahead of the interests of the ACT community. How can he make such a claim? Is it not the fact that Canberra airport is one of the territory's most valuable assets? Of course it is! Indeed, the Chief Minister has confirmed this. He wrote to me  in relation to the airport and said:We are very aware of its importance not only as a major gateway to the nation's Capital, but also as a key economic driver for Canberra and the region.It is not in the community's interest to curtail development of the airport as a national gateway either now or in the future, and we will continue to work closely with CIA - that is, Canberra International Airport - to establish and meet its long term needs in this regard.These are words of very great commonsense from the Chief Minister, so I do not understand why on earth it is that he says, in the next breath, that we should not look to the long-term needs of the airport and therefore to Canberra and its economy. His own ministers have been saying just this week that you cannot ignore proper process and that you cannot just plonk a building down anywhere. That is sound advice, and exactly the same applies here.I call on the ACT government to suspend its consideration of the Hume site. The member for Eden-Monaro has very strongly pointed out its problems, and that includes its proximity to HMAS Harman and the SouthCare helicopter base, as well as the ACT's complete lack of community consultation. I ask those commentators who have been writing about this in recent days to refer to the correspondence between the Chief Minister and me, which I now table. All the ACT government needs to do is to wait and see - it will not take long - whether or not land becomes available. I am hopeful that it will and, if it does, we will seek to meet Canberra's needs in a reasonable way.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I was informed by the Salvation Army that it intended to refocus its activities on its central mission. It was going to concentrate its activities on funding the most disadvantaged in society rather than the broader cross-section of the community in aged care, so it has taken a policy decision to sell some - not all - of its aged care facilities. - I have been given assurances by the Salvation Army that there will be continuity of care for all residents, there will be certainty for the residents and their interests will at all times be paramount in this transfer. The transfer of these places, like all other transfers - and this is not a rare occurrence; some 3,000 places or more have changed hands in the last six months nationally - will of course be subject to the strict guidelines and stringent assessment that the Department of Health and Ageing will apply under the government's Aged Care Act.As to the financial position of the sale, I will quote from the Salvation Army representative. He said: Well, there's going to be no extra bed shortages as a result of this sale. These are very viable aged care centres. He went on to say: They are to be sold as going concerns, as is. I am aware of the great deal of interest already in these homes, and that would also be evidenced by the enormous support that the market has given to the recent aged care round's allocations. The aged care round was oversubscribed by some five to one, so there is huge market demand for aged care places across the country, and I have no doubt that there will be solid interest in these places. In relation to the question of the financial state of the aged care industry, this government has put more money into aged care than any other Commonwealth government in the history of Federation. It took some 30 years for federal government funding to reach a level of $3 billion. It took just seven years for this government to double aged care funding to $6 billion. In relation to the Hogan review, in 2001, at the election, the government promised to commission a detailed review of aged care funding and of pricing arrangements in residential care -  - and as result Professor Warren Hogan was commissioned to carry out the review. He has had an extensive inquiry under way for just over 12 months. Last December he asked for an extension of time, given that he had received some 912 financial submissions, which is an extraordinary response from the industry. He asked for further time in which to consider those financial submissions. Of course I agreed to an extension of time; it would be irresponsible not to have done so. In the meantime, Professor Hogan has provided a draft outline of his thinking. Recently he provided a draft interim report. As is the case with all reports of this nature, the government will await a final report with final recommendations before responding.But it is interesting that the member should ask a question about aged care. There was great expectation at the Labor conference that the Labor Party would unveil its aged care policy. After all, it has had eight years in opposition to develop a single policy in aged care. But what happened at the conference? Nothing! There was just a grab bag of stale, old ideas - not one new idea in aged care - and totally unfunded promises. - Mr Speaker, I was asked about the Hogan review. The Hogan review will be delivered shortly. When Labor was confronted with its policy failure, what did it say it would do? It said it would hold a Senate inquiry. Oh, please! What a pathetic excuse for policy failure. </DOC>

 - I appreciate that very good question from the member for Pearce. It is great news that full-time employment in Australia has increased by over 29,000 jobs, taking us to a record high of 6.95 million Australians in employment. It is great news for Australia. It is also good news for small business because 3.3 million Australians are employed in small business. Of course, small business could do better. However, on 34 occasions now the Labor Party has refused to pass our changes to the unfair dismissal laws. On 34 occasions the Labor Party has voted against the creation of 50,000 new jobs in small business. On 34 occasions the Labor Party has put the interests of their mates in the union movement ahead of the interests of working Australians and 1.1 million small businesses. I used to rationalise this -  - I used to rationalise this as the Labor Party just being true to form. - We remember the member for Brand, as Leader of the Opposition, who said on 6PR that the Labor Party never pretended to be the party for small business - and nothing has changed. The new Leader of the Opposition has decided once again to reject changes to the unfair dismissal laws, and now he wants to go further by fiddling with casual employment and giving unions right of access to premises for membership recruitment, and he is putting more red tape on small business by asking employees returning from maternity leave whether they are going to take part-time employment. During his forgotten years - or should we say the deleted years - the old member for Werriwa said this:Highly skilled workers now command stronger bargaining power ... than many small businesses.So what does he do when he becomes leader? He announces that they are abolishing AWAs. On the one hand he said previously that workers are even more powerful than small business but as soon as he gets into a leadership position he says that, in fact, small business is more powerful than workers. Flip-flop. As the commentator Robert Gottliebsen said in Monday's Australian:Unfortunately, Latham has been captured by ... dangerous ALP thinking.How right that is. New leader, old Labor.</DOC>

 - I have indicated on behalf of the government that we will introduce legislation. The legislation will not have any retrospective effect. The legislation will provide for the closing down, with effect on people who enter the parliament for the first time at the next election, of the existing scheme, and it will attract a government contribution of nine per cent. I think it is a fair, reasonable and entirely defensible - and, indeed, well-arguable - proposition that people who enter into an arrangement or part of their career on a certain basis are entitled to enjoy the entitlements of that arrangement as they entered into it. Speaking for myself, I will be very happy at any time to answer to the Australian public in relation to my stewardship of both the position that I now hold and the positions that I have held during my almost 30 years in public life. The Leader of the Opposition may argue cases in relation to what he might do in relation to what he does not now have, but that is entirely his right. The Australian people will make their judgment accordingly.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Canning for his question. The honourable member for Canning obviously has specific interest, on behalf of his constituents, in the successful passage of this agreement through both the United States Congress and this parliament so that his exporters can benefit from what is a historic deal that Australia has struck with the world's largest and most dynamic economy. In fact, the United States economy accounts for one-third of global GDP.In answer to the member's question, over the weekend President Bush notified congress that he would be signing the Australia-US FTA in 90 days time and sending it to congress. From 12 May the FTA bill will be debated by congressional committees and then on the floor of the US House and the US Senate. This is a demonstrated commitment by President Bush, Ambassador Zoellick and the administration of their support of this deal and their desire to have it implemented in what is a presidential election year in the United States.There is strong bipartisan support in the United States, with pro-trade Democrats joining pro-trade Republicans in supporting this deal both publicly and in the corridors of the congress. It is the sort of bipartisanship that the member for Canning's constituents would like to see here in Australia so that they could reap the benefits of this agreement. Export industries throughout Australia are looking forward to a once-in-a-generation opportunity to access the world's wealthiest market. The question remains: will Labor ultimately support those industries, or will Labor oppose an opportunity for them to do better in that very strong market? Will Labor support exporters in industries like beef, education, government procurement, dairy, macadamia nuts, ship repairs, automotive, canned tuna, fruit juices and many more, or is the Labor Party going to walk away from the working families in those industries?In our parliament, as members opposite would be aware, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties has been tasked with investigating and reporting on the free trade agreement. The Australian Labor Party have six members on JSCOT to review the agreement and look after their interests. It is interesting to note that on the Senate inquiry that has been proposed the Labor Party will have only three members. One needs to ask the question: can't the six members on JSCOT do a better job of analysing and running a critique on this than three members on a Senate inquiry? We would argue that they can and they will. - There is nothing to hide. JSCOT is an institution that our government has established in this parliament so that both houses can scrutinise treaties that the government has signed - and that was never available to the people of Australia through the parliament prior to our coming into office in 1996. Is this just another Labor stunt, or is the Labor Party genuinely interested in the interests of Australia's exporters and the workers who work in those industries?</DOC>

 - When I agreed with the Leader of the Opposition, what I had in mind was Centenary House. The Leader of the Opposition reminds me of the answer I gave; let me remind him of another part of that answer. He was speaking last week of action that he believed he would take if he were to be elected to government. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that he can take action tonight to reduce that level of public cynicism. It remains an absolute disgrace that a piece of real estate in Canberra attracts a higher rental than the CBD of central Manhattan. That is the measure of this outrageous deal. Over the 15-year life of the lease, the expected net rip-off - that is, the amount charged less the real market rate - is $36 million. That is $36 million going - like a pipeline from the Mint - straight into the pockets of the Australian Labor Party in order to fund its election campaign. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for once again reminding me of one of the reasons why the level of public trust and the degree of cynicism are not at the levels that we would like. This has been a rort on the Australian taxpayer, and it lies within the immediate capacity of the Leader of the Opposition to instruct the National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party to renegotiate the lease. He does not have to get elected to renegotiate the lease, because the Labor Party is effectively the landlord. While ever this $36 million rip-off by the Australian Labor Party remains unexpurged, and until the Labor Party does something about it, the Leader of the Opposition has no credibility lecturing me about cynicism towards politics.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. The member for Boothby takes a great deal of interest in this issue, not just on behalf of his constituents in Adelaide - some of whom may benefit in the automotive sector from this deal - but also as the chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which will be running a critical analysis of the negotiated outcome of the Australia-United States free trade agreement. In response to his question, the South Australian Labor government did have some work done prior to this agreement. That was conducted by the Allen Consulting Group, and they found broad benefits to the Australian economy. Their report indicated that, even with no improvement in agriculture, no access for cars and automotive parts, and no access to the US government procurement market, the gains to Australia would grow by around $500 million per annum. That is with those three key areas excluded from their analysis. As we know, those three areas are now included in the deal that has been negotiated. Every state, and the Northern Territory, is better off, according to the analysis by the Allen Consulting Group. Even with no sugar access, Queensland is a straightforward winner, according to this report that was delivered to the South Australian Labor government.The member for Boothby asked if there are other examples of industries that are clear winners and that support what we have done. There are. I instance a couple of very diverse and different industries in Australia - one being the macadamia industry. Macadamia farmers will see real gains. Our macadamia nut exports attract a tariff of 5c a kilo on unprocessed nuts and a tariff of 17.6 per cent on value-added products, such as roasted nuts. Under the agreement, the tariff on unprocessed nuts will disappear immediately and the value-added tariff will be phased out over four years.The macadamia industry is worth $120 million and it employs 5,000 people. It is a labour intensive industry. Members of the industry are looking forward to better access to the world's biggest market for macadamia nuts. Graeme Hargreaves, the President the Australian Macadamia Society, said that the tariff removal would enable Australian growers to do more value adding here, create more jobs and expand the industry.The FTA could also enormously benefit our health sector. The Chief Executive of Medicines Australia has said that the FTA has the capacity to attract $1 billion worth of US research activity into Australia. He said:We have many advantages in Australia that can make us a major medicinal hub for the region - there is excellent medical research infrastructure, high quality clinical research capability, innovative biotech companies and a highly skilled, high-tech, knowledge based workforce.Those are two further examples of why we should, as a nation, be supporting this agreement for the benefit of future generations of Australians. The South Australian Labor government have that on record. They have that analysis in their hands. The South Australian Labor government know that this is in the national interest, the Australian Macadamia Society knows this is in the national interest, Medicines Australia knows this is in the national interest. It bedevils us as to why the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party will not recognise that this deal is in the national interest.</DOC>

 - Far from those figures validating the proposition advanced by the Leader of the Opposition, they actually validate and reinforce the urgent need for the Senate to pass the MedicarePlus safety net. Every day that the opposition delays the passage of the safety net, more and more Australians are disadvantaged. I thank the Leader of the Opposition very much for this question, because he knows, and anybody who understands the medical system in this country knows, that no government can guarantee a particular level of bulk-billing. When the Leader of the Opposition  runs around the country disingenuously trying to induce people to believe that, if there were a change of government, you could guarantee a particular level of bulk-billing, he knows that that is wrong.Even if you had a higher level of bulk-billing for GPs, there would still be many MBS services - such as specialist consultations, tissue biopsies, radiology and a whole long list of services - where out-of-pocket expenses being incurred by Australians would be covered by the safety net. As I said to the Leader of the Opposition last week, the opposition of his party to this measure is a classic example of what I call `dog in the manger' politics. It is perfectly open to the Labor Party to support this measure without inhibiting their capacity, if they were to win the next election, to introduce their own policy, because there is no conflict between what Labor are offering in this area and the introduction of the MedicarePlus safety net. The only reason Labor are against this is because it has been put up by the Howard government. That is the reason, and that, of course, is why they are against the free trade agreement. So, far from the Leader of the Opposition inviting me to adopt Labor's policy, I would invite him to put the national interest ahead of dog in the manger politics and pass the MedicarePlus safety net.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question. In response, let me make essentially three points. First of all, this country has entered into free trade agreements since 1983, which was the year when we entered into the closer economic relations agreement with New Zealand. A review was done last year - the 20th anniversary of CER - and it found that, as a result of that agreement, two-way trade had grown by 550 per cent in those 20 years. So the benefits have been enormous for New Zealand as well as Australia. Proportionately, I would concede the benefits have been greater for New Zealand because it is the smaller economy but nevertheless benefits have been there for Australia as well. It has been a good thing. There have also been free trade agreements negotiated recently with Singapore and Thailand.The fact is that these agreements are a win-win situation for Australian trade. I note that the Labor Party did not oppose any of those agreements. Although the free trade agreement with New Zealand was negotiated by the Fraser government it was actually brought into force once the Hawke government came to power - no opposition from the Labor Party.The second point I would make is that the free trade agreement Australia has entered into with the United States is not unique in another respect: the United States is entering into free trade agreements with a number of other countries. Recently, it concluded a free trade agreement with Chile. It is negotiating a free trade area of the Americas, which is expected to be completed in 2005, and it is about to initiate negotiations with Thailand. One point that the House - particularly the opposition - needs to reflect on is that if we do not proceed with our free trade agreement with the United States then those countries that have concluded those agreements will gain a still greater competitive advantage over Australia in the American market.My own electorate includes a lot of grape growers and winemakers, as does yours, Mr Speaker. Those people will be less competitive in the American market after the free trade agreement with Chile comes into effect because Chileans will have the advantage over Australians in the American wine market. The list of countries that have FTAs with America will grow and grow and our relative disadvantage in that American market will grow and grow if the Labor Party gets its way and scuttles the free trade agreement with the United States.Let me make my final point: Labor's proposal is apparently that it is better to reject the free trade agreement we negotiated, it is -  - better to make sure that our businesses miss out on that greater market access; it is better to ensure our businesses have a relatively poorer position in the American market because other countries have FTAs. We in this House are expected to believe that a Leader of the Opposition who called the President of the United States `the most incompetent and dangerous president in living memory' is somebody who, on becoming Prime Minister, can pick up the telephone and say to President Bush, `Give us a better free trade agreement,' and that President Bush would say, `Yes, we'll do that.' If you believe that, you will believe one of the Mem Fox stories that the Leader of the Opposition says we should all read to our children - and we do.</DOC>

 - It was my announcement and it is only proper that I should answer the question. National bulk-billing figures -  - will continue to be released quarterly, as has been the case for many years. This is a government which has been unprecedentedly open with statistics to do with our health system. No bulk-billing figures were released regularly on an electorate by electorate basis prior to 2002. I am advised by my department that doing it in the ad hoc way that we were doing it was costing in the order of $100,000 a year. That is money which could be better spent -  - on delivering health care services to the Australian people. I simply point out that electorate by electorate figures were never routinely released by the former government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. The free trade agreement is unambiguously good news for science and technology. It gives us the opportunity to better tap into the world's largest and most successful and best funded science and innovation system. The free trade agreement will encourage United States venture capital and know-how investment in Australia that will boost scientific research uptake, particularly in the area of commercialisation of research.Let me give two examples of how the FTA will enhance the size of our markets and create new opportunities. Firstly, in the private sector there is ResMed. That, as many members would know, is a distinguished New South Wales based manufacturer, specialising in products for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. They have established a new factory in the north-west of Sydney in the electorate of Mitchell. I have visited that area with the member for Mitchell and met a great many of his science and innovation practitioners. I know that this is very considerable investment for his electorate, as well as for the nation. The company advises us that implementation of the FTA could be worth several million in sales in the short-term, with the prospect of a much larger uptake in the years ahead.Let us look now at the public sector and the science agency CSIRO. CSIRO's experience is that engagement with the United States presently comprises a variety of impediments and CSIRO's view is that the FTA will lead to advantages particularly in relation to its more commercially oriented projects where it has an Australian company as a partner - and that is the key to it: where it is in partnership with an Australian company. CSIRO is involved in discussions on hybrid and electric vehicles, fuel cells, light metals, hydrogen storage in the form of super capacitors and batteries from the automotive industry. CSIRO considers that the FTA will facilitate this engagement and that it removes both perceived and real barriers to expanding collaborative efforts in these important areas. Other examples include CSIRO's extensive research collaboration with Boeing in Seattle, which also offers the prospect of expansion under the FTA. It is incomprehensible that the Australian Labor Party is opposing the FTA. Anybody with an interest in science and innovation knows that it is to the benefit of Australia in a way that has not been offered or open to us previously. But the Australian Labor Party's opposition should not surprise us, with its complete absence of a science and technology policy. There was but one item discussed at its recent national conference, and that was a resolution moved by the still invisible shadow minister for science which committed the Labor Party to completing the $300 million construction of the replacement research reactor at Lucas Heights, but not to operating it once its construction has been completed. Instead there would be another inquiry into the research reactor; that would be the seventh inquiry in the last decade. The Labor Party has no science policy. The stupidity of completing the construction of the research reactor but not operating it defies belief. But, then again, this is the Australian Labor Party that has never been able to distinguish the national interest from its own self-interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England. I can say immediately that his electorate will be a lot better off as a result of the free trade agreement. I assume from the rather querulous character of his question that maybe he does not support it. I hope he does, because it is in the interests of the people he currently represents. The Minister for Trade indicated yesterday, during an excellent performance on Meet the Press, that the government was giving attention to the question of economic analysis, and I can only repeat what the minister said on that occasion. The member asks me about the single desk. Getting rid of the single desk was not part of the negotiation and nothing in the agreement affects its operation. The text, I understand according to the experts, is being scrubbed at the present time. When the scrubbing has been finished, the pristine product will be available. I can only say again that this remains one of the great trade achievements of this government. It is something where we have put the national interest ahead of sectional interests. I recognise the disappointment of some sectors, of which the sugar industry is an example. I expect to meet representatives of the sugar industry here in Canberra within the next couple of days, and I hope to have the opportunity of going to far North Queensland to talk to people in the industry, for whom I have considerable empathy, great respect and a great deal of sympathy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. I can inform the House that the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the December lending finance figures today. Those figures showed that in December total housing finance fell by 3.9 per cent following a four per cent fall in November. I should put that in perspective. Notwithstanding a fall in both November and December, over the course of the year housing finance has risen still by 20.0 per cent. The decline in housing finance in the latter part of 2003 reflected a fall in both owner-occupier and investor finance: owner-occupier finance decreased by 2.5 per cent in December following a 3.4 per cent fall in November, and investing housing finance decreased four per cent in December after a 5.6 per cent decrease in November. The lending finance publication also shows that personal finance commitments fell 1.1 per cent in December while commercial finance remains very strong, increasing by 9.3 per cent.These figures appear to confirm other signs that indicate the housing market is beginning to cool. These include a decrease in building approvals, lower auction clearance rates and slower house price growth. Over the course of the last year and indeed previous years, housing finance has dramatically increased, as you would expect in an economy where interest rates are at historical lows, where consumer confidence is at historical highs and where unemployment is at the lowest rate for 22 years. Notwithstanding that, the growth in housing finance, building approvals and prices has been at such a rate that it is hard to think that it would be sustainable over the medium to longer term.So the government welcomes the fact that it looks like prices are beginning to stabilise and lending finance is beginning to stabilise as well. The likelihood is that, if those indicators plateau and there is a stabilisation, the situation will be more sustainable over the medium term and into the longer term and that the housing market could avoid a substantial correction. I think overall these figures, notwithstanding their showing a decline, will be welcome. They will be consistent with a slowing in the market, which gives better options over the medium to longer term.</DOC>

 - The claim made by the member is not correct. I take this opportunity, having now had the benefit of reading again the task force report -  - to say that the claim mounted by the member for Lilley and others - that this report recommended urgent changes were needed to the family benefits system - is wrong. Let me read some paragraphs from the report, seeing that the member for Lilley is so fascinated by it. - It is a very good report, and it reflects very well on the government. It is a very good report. Paragraph 80 reads in part as follows:The government has introduced significant enhancements to arrangements assisting Australians to balance work and family life since 1996. The introduction of A New Tax System in 2000 brought lower personal tax rates and enhanced government transfers to families with dependent children. The government spends over $8.5 billion per annum on family tax benefit part A, which has strengthened financial support for low- and middle-income families. It spends over $2.5 billion per annum on family tax benefit part B, which has made the choice to have a parent at home caring for children full-time, particularly in children's early years, more viable for many families, including sole parents. Expenditure on childcare benefit has grown to over $1.3 billion per annum, improving the previously declining affordability of child care, particularly for lower income worker families.Paragraph 81 goes on and gets even better. It says:The government's reforms to the workplace relations system have increased flexibility for employers to provide and for employees to negotiate family friendly policies tailored to the individual workplace. The government has also expanded services for parents, particularly those returning to paid work, with a number of childcare places attracting Commonwealth financial assistance across all service types, increasing from 306,500 in 1996 to more than 500,000 in June 2001.Importantly, paragraph 129 states:the interdepartmental task force has concluded from Treasury modelling that tax arrangements and financial assistance for families are generally adequate in supporting ongoing choices by parents to stay at home or participate in the paid work force and overall do not favour dual income or single income families.Of course, the report acknowledged that there were areas where further changes and enhancements could be made. That is always the case with any family benefits system. But the presentation of the opposition - that in some way this report said that a drastic overhaul was needed, that the system was falling apart and that families were being penalised as a result - is completely contrary to the thrust of the report.For the benefit of the member for Lilley, might I remind him that I in fact made a presentation on the essence of this report at the Liberal Party convention in Adelaide last year. A summary of that presentation, with all the essential findings of the report, was made available to the media at the time. As the opposition will know, in preparing the last budget, after providing for necessary additional expenditure on defence and national security, it was decided that priority should be given to across-the-board tax relief. Any suggestion from the opposition that the government deliberately sat on this report, having the capacity to implement further enhancements while at the same time delivering tax cuts and extra spending on defence and national security, is completely wrong and one that I totally reject.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question on this very important matter. As members are aware, the Australian government has been working to ensure that rural and regional roads are properly funded. Often those roads are small, out of sight and all too easily put out of mind, yet the great bulk of our exports start on those roads, as do a lot of our jobs and a great deal of the nation's value adding. There are also many social factors, such as the capacity to get your kids to school when it has been raining, to get to a doctor in an emergency and so forth.It is hard to think of a program that has been more widely welcomed the length and breadth of the nation than Roads to Recovery. It has been extremely successful in delivering funds to where those funds are needed and where they can do the most good - directly to the councils across the nation. To that end, as part of a $2 billion increased funding package for roads that I announced in January, I announced an additional $1.2 billion to continue this program for a further four years. That is $1.2 billion of new money, an additional $300 million per year to be provided to local authorities. Two-hundred million dollars will be provided on exactly the same formula that is used at the moment, with some minor variations where there have been shire boundary changes and to look after the interests of those unincorporated areas in the really remote parts of the country. We will also be allowing councils to bid for another $100 million on the basis that they use it for projects with strategic importance, such as timber roads, other industries' exporting roads and export performance. In other words, we are looking for councils to think strategically about their local region.So I have been overwhelmed and I think government members have been overwhelmed - and I am sure members of the ALP have been overwhelmed too - by the great outpouring of popular enthusiasm, particularly from councils. Many of them were very relieved. They had been subjected to a scare campaign suggesting that the program would be finished, but that is not the case.I was asked about alternative policies. I have to say on this one the Labor Party's position has been extraordinarily difficult to follow. Their initial reaction when we launched this package was that it was a `boondoggle' - do we all remember that word? It was a boondoggle. We all went scrambling for dictionaries, thesauruses and so forth to find out what a boondoggle was. It was not very nice. But it soon became clear that local councils thought the program was the best thing since sliced bread. And then we saw a bit of populist moving from the Labor Party. They decided that perhaps they would support the program, but they would not rule out changing it for their own ends.Then the shadow spokesman, the member for Batman, said that what the program needed was - wait for it - a `strategic' element. So we said we would have a strategic element, and then the shadow spokesman attacked it because, he said, it would be a slush fund for use in the coming election. The only problem with that is that the strategic element does not appear until halfway through next term. So then Labor said that they would continue a Roads to Recovery `style' of program.The member for Batman stated that the Labor Party's program would have strict criteria, to be determined by industry and all tiers of government. That means that the Labor Party intend that the program should no longer be untied. What do local governments most appreciate about the program? It is the fact that they can allocate it according to their priorities, because they know where they are. But there are those in the Labor Party making it plain that they are going to tell councils what they can build and what they cannot build. They are either going to tie it directly to themselves or, even worse, they are going to give it to the state governments - the very thing local governments most fear - so that they can set councils' schedules.So I reckon the Labor Party ought to come clean on this. They ought to tell us what they intend to do with this program. Until they clarify their position, there will be real uncertainty, and local governments need certainty on this so that they can plan ahead. I challenge the Leader of the Opposition, in his newfound desire to rush out and please everyone, to tell local governments what he intends doing with this program so that local governments can plan with certainty.</DOC>

 - The cabinet did note a lot of things. We noted the great success of changes that we have introduced since 1996. We noted that if we had the financial resources to do so we could do many other things. But cabinet also noted that in preparing the 2003-04 budget we had to give priority to defence and national security. We also decided on that occasion to give priority over everything else, with the remaining surplus that we had in hand, to an across the board tax cut, which the Labor Party voted for. The reality is that governments, if they had unlimited resources, would do everything. But no government has unlimited resources.  - The reality is that from time to time you make decisions about priorities. The priority that we allocated in the budget of 2003-04 was that of a greater level of support for across the board tax cuts than for other kinds of assistance. We do not apologise for that; we do not resile from it. We think it was the right priority, and the Australian Labor Party voted for it. We did not hear the Australian Labor Party standing up and saying, `You shouldn't have tax cuts; you should have paid maternity leave instead.' The Australian Labor Party were not saying that; they were perfectly happy to adopt our priority. As I indicated last week, policy in the area of work and family remains under consideration. But the member for Jagajaga ought to understand - she has been in this place long enough to know it - that if you spend your available resources and do not make proper provision for a surplus and financially prudent management, you will pretty quickly run this country back into the sorts of economic conditions that obtained under the former government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. I know how committed she is to the MedicarePlus safety net and how keen her electors are on getting that safety net in place. This government is totally committed to Medicare. Medicare means affordable access to high-quality health care for all Australians. It does not mean that every medical service will always be free for everyone. It is true, as members opposite keep pointing out, that bulk-billing rates have fallen a little. But two out of three GP consultations are still bulk-billed.  - The bulk-billing incentive payment announced as part of MedicarePlus will make it far more worth while for doctors to keep bulk-billing their patients.GP expenses are only a modest proportion of the out-of-pocket medical expenses that too many Australians now face. For instance, the average gap payment for an MRI is $103, the average gap payment for a CT scan is $83, the average gap payment for a pregnancy ultrasound is $56 and the average gap payment for a specialist visit is $28. None of these services have ever been widely bulk-billed. For the 1,100 Australian families which have already incurred more than $500 in out-of-pocket doctor expenses in just one month of January, only five per cent of these are attributable to GP costs. Getting bulk-billing rates for GPs back to 80 per cent will do little or nothing for these people who are now badly out of pocket under the existing system. If the MedicarePlus safety net is not passed, 200,000 Australian families will be badly out of pocket, 200,000 Australian families will miss out on the benefit of the safety net but 20 million Australians will miss out on the security that only the safety net can provide.Let's make it very clear - Labor is opposed to the safety net because it puts old-fashioned ideology ahead of practical help to people in need. The Leader of the Opposition used to be in favour of safety nets. He used to support safety nets. He said:... the role of government is simple and twofold: first, to maximise choice ... and, second, to establish an efficient system of safety net provision ...That is what the Leader of the Opposition used to think. He was right then; he is wrong now. The longer the Labor Party opposes the MedicarePlus safety net, the more people will conclude that the Leader of the Opposition is not interested in building a ladder of opportunity for them; he is more interested in his climbing the ladder of opportunism.</DOC>

 - One reason why the government will not adopt that is that we think it would actually make it harder for many people in that situation to be employed in the first place. If one imposes that kind of obligation upon small businesses that have only two or three employees, one will simply impose a burden that they cannot afford.  - That kind of requirement is okay if you work for the Commonwealth Public Service, the ABC or Westpac, but, if you are the local small business man or woman who has three employees, the idea of mandating an entitlement to demand part-time work for each of those shows an even more abysmal understanding of how small business operates -  - than I imagine is possessed by the Australian Labor Party. - The Australian Labor Party have always been anti small business. That is why they voted against the unfair dismissal laws. I am delighted that the member for Rankin has entered this debate, because every time he does so we are reminded of just how retrograde were the motions on industrial relations adopted at the Labor Party national conference. Not only will they continue to keep the burden of unfair dismissal laws on small business but they will abolish Australian workplace agreements and they will give a right of entry to bullying union leaders. They will make it a requirement of doing business with any future Labor government that companies disclose the identity of their subcontractors so that the union bovver boys can go along and exercise the appropriate amount of muscle if they are not doing the right thing by their comrades. That is basically what the Labor Party are all about. All I can say is that the more questions asked by the member for Rankin, the happier we on this side of the House are.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, the mistake is understandable, because we on this side of the parliament equate small business and employment together, which is something the other side does not do. I think the reaction from the Australian Labor Party to the question from the member for Farrer shows the complete disdain they have for small business in Australia. It is estimated that there are some 800,000 independent contractors in Australia. As the Prime Minister indicated in his answer to the previous question from the member for Rankin, these small business operators and independent contractors are under assault from the Australian Labor Party. This was clearly revealed in the Australian Labor Party's draft platform for their national conference just recently. The Australian Labor Party intend to expand the definition of `employee' to include all those in so-called employment type contracts. In other words, independent contractors in Australia, some of those 800,000 small business operators in this country, would be dragged by the Labor Party into the industrial relations and workplace relations scheme in this country. If this sounds like rhetoric, let me explain it with a real example being imposed by the Australian Labor Party right at this time. The Australian Labor Party government in South Australia are proposing a provision which will allow union members and representatives to walk through the doors of small business operators even if no union members are employed there. This is a provision in a bill -  -  - As I was saying, this is a bill before the South Australian parliament at the present time which will give the union bosses and their representatives the right to walk through the doors of small business operators in that state -  - they do not like it, Mr Speaker - even if they do not have a union member employed there. Why? - At a time when union membership in the private sector in Australia is at just 17 per cent, the reason is clear. Fifty-eight per cent of the delegates at the national conference of the ALP were from a union background. This is a case of repaying the $40 million that the unions in Australia have donated to the Australian Labor Party over the last eight years - the 40 million reasons why the Australian Labor Party are adopting policies at this time which will take us backwards insofar as industrial relations are concerned. In the Australian just last week the respected business commentator Robert Gottliebsen said:... the ALP ... want to end employment contracts and have most people work under awards as they did half a century ago. That way, employees can be unionised and the clock turned back.The reality is that in the last eight years, under the policies of this government, 1.3 million jobs have been created in this country. The policies of the ALP are those of an opposition that is hell-bent on destroying jobs in Australia. The government will continue to put in place policies that will create jobs in Australia and bring about security for ordinary Australian workers and their families, something which the Leader of the Opposition and his party are walking away from.</DOC>

 - I refer the member for Lilley to the earlier answers I have given in relation to cabinet's deliberations. But, while on my feet, I will take the opportunity on the general subject canvassed by the member for Lilley - because this was the subject of questions asked by him and the member for Jagajaga - to read paragraph 183 of the task force report, which is so beloved by the member for Lilley and the member for Jagajaga. I recommend careful and attentive listening to this paragraph, which says:Incentives for a second parent to take up work in single income families are generally good across the income range.I repeat that: they are generally good across the income range. This, incidentally, is a result of policies introduced by the government. It goes on to say:A significant element of the new tax system - That is the one you voted against. There was no other new tax system -  -  - Mr Speaker, I am eternally apologetic. Let me put it this way: we on this side of the House introduced A New Tax System, and those who sit opposite voted against it. The Australian Labor Party voted against something which was described by the task force report, on which they now seek to rely, in the following terms:A significant element of the new tax system is the improved work incentives for families brought about by the reduction in effective marginal tax rates from the combined impact of reduced family assistance withdrawal rates and lower personal tax rates.I wonder, pray tell, whose effective marginal tax rates were reduced by the introduction of the new tax system. Was it the effective marginal tax rates introduced by this government, or could it have been the effective marginal tax rates introduced by the former government? I wonder which of those two it was. The paragraph goes on to say:A recent study by NATSEM found that only a relatively small proportion of families and singles now faced EMTRs in excess of 60 per cent.It then goes on to talk about the key group, which has been quoted by the member for Lilley and the member for Jagajaga. One might ask in the interests of honesty and balance: why didn't both of them quote paragraph 183 last week -  - when they first got the document, because they practise the art of selective quotation whenever they ask questions in this House.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question and his very strong support for a school education, whether at Richmond High School or at Blue Mountains Grammar in his own electorate. This government strongly believes that all Australians, having paid their taxes at a state and federal level to fund Australian public education, will be free and supported by this government in choosing to send their children to a Catholic or independent school if they choose.The Australian Labor Party at the moment is supporting a campaign which is being run by the Australian Education Union, which is run in a climate of deception and which is intended to mislead the Australian community and parents by omission in refusing to provide Australian parents with the full facts in relation to school funding. There are 3.3 million students in Australian schools, and 2.2 million, or 68 per cent, go to Australian government state schools. Almost 1.1 million, or 32 per cent, attend Catholic and independent schools. The 68 per cent of students - the 2.2 million - in Australian state schools receive in total $20 billion of public funding. The 1.1 million students in the Catholic and independent schools do not receive $10 billion and they do not receive $9 billion; they receive $6.2 billion, and there is $4 billion of hard-earned after-tax money that is paid by parents in fees to Catholic and independent schools.The facts contained in this graph, which will not be run by the Australian Education Union, show that the $20 billion which is made available to 2.2 million students in state schools is not being explained by the Australian Labor Party or the apologists in the unions. As for the advertisement that is being run by the Australian Education Union, which targets Scotch College and compares it with Glen Waverley Secondary College: Scotch College has 1,830 students and receives $3.5 million in public funding; Glen Waverley Secondary College receives $20 million in public funding for the same number of students. - What this campaign is all about is two things.  - It is, firstly, an attempt by the Australian Education Union and the Labor Party to distract attention from the fact that state governments are underfunding state schools, for which they have primary responsibility for management, regulation and funding. Last year, state governments in this country increased funding to state schools by 2.1 per cent. This government - the Australian government - while providing about 12 per cent of the funding to state schools increased its funding by 5½ per cent. Year after year this happens, so that last year $667 million was not available for state schools in this country because they were being underfunded by state governments. - The second objective of this campaign is to disguise the fact that the Australian Labor Party has an agenda to remove money from Catholic and independent schools. On 7 July last year, the Sydney Morning Herald reported:Public teacher unions have a $1 million fighting fund to campaign before the next federal election for private school funding to be slashed and have already singled out Catholic schools for special attention.The President of the Australian Education Union, Pat Byrne, said a group of 12 federal politicians - Labor - had also been formed to lobby for more funding - The President of the AEU went on to say:... the powerful Catholic lobby had already started 'public positioning' for more funding ...She said:The danger for us is that the Catholic sector will be the winner in whatever emerges.I was reading a special edition of `Hands Up', which was the union's parliamentary brief for the Australian Labor Party's national conference. It says:The AEU campaign is being assisted by a group of Labor MPs.The reality is that the Labor Party has an agenda, and its agenda is to make it less affordable for Australian parents to choose the kind of school which they think best meets the needs and aspirations they have for their children. The Leader of the Opposition wrote a book What did you learn today? My challenge to the Australian Labor Party is: what did it learn in the last three years? - Whether the Labor Party wants to accept it or not, every child in every non-government school in this country - in Catholic schools and independent schools - receives less public money than if they were being educated in a state school. The kids from the poorest families get 30 per cent less; the kids from the wealthiest, 87½ per cent less. I say to Australian parents that this government will strongly continue to support well-funded public schools and to pressure state governments to properly fund their state schools. This government will stand shoulder to shoulder with Australian parents in making enormous sacrifices to send their children to Catholic and independent schools and making sure it is affordable.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question. Let me remind him of what was said by me and others at the time this issue was raised. The party I lead took the view in relation to the source of donations that, if they were donated by corporations and individuals carrying on lawful activities, there was no reason in principle why the donation should not be accepted. But let me take the opportunity to speculate that the amount of money the Australian Labor Party is giving up in tobacco company contributions is as a minnow to a whale in relation to the $36 million it is ripping off the Australian public for Centenary House. This is a giant piece of extortion of the Australian public. Over the 15-year life of the lease, the expected rip-off is going to be some $36 million. The Leader of the Opposition comes to this debate with very dirty hands indeed. The Leader of the Opposition has it within his capacity tonight to get in touch with the national secretary of his party and say, `Tim, the game is up.' - No, I have not. - I am making the point, in response to a question asked of me about political donations, that the Australian Labor Party is extorting $3 million a year out of the Australian public. The deal that was entered into more than 10 years ago by the Australian Labor Party was a shocking abuse of power by the Australian Labor Party at the time. And if the Leader of the Opposition had any credibility on the issue of sources of donations, instead of baring his chest and trumpeting his great morality in relation to a few thousand dollars from tobacco companies he would have the guts to give up the $36 million which he is ripping off the Australian public. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan for his question, because it enables me to draw the attention of the House and the attention of the Australian public to the fact that right at the moment the Australian Labor Party in the Senate is blocking the passage of legislation which would enable 35,000 more Australian families to receive top-up payments in relation to their family benefits. The truth is that this government introduced top-up payments for Australian families in relation to family tax benefits. That meant that last year some 585,000 Australian families, from recollection, received top-up payments worth about $850 a family.We wanted to go even further than that; we wanted to amend the law so that the top-ups could go back an additional year. That would benefit an additional 35,000 Australian families. I am told that the Labor Party is blocking that legislation because it wants to go - so it says - even further, although, on my advice, going back three years as it wants to do would run foul of the privacy provision under the social security legislation and the taxation legislation.This is another example of what I described yesterday as dog in the manger politics. The Labor Party could very easily pass this legislation and, if it were to win government and it wanted to go further, it could do so. It is one thing to oppose a piece of legislation that fundamentally alters the structure of something so that a future government would find it very difficult to go back to what it really wanted; it is entirely another thing to block a piece of legislation because you do not have the opportunity, because you are not in government, of fashioning something entirely to your desire. Right at the moment there are 35,000 Australian families being denied by the Labor Party the additional benefits under this proposal. Not only did the Labor Party fail to give top-ups in government; it is now blocking the extension of the very generous top-up scheme under our family tax benefits arrangements in opposition. As I called on Labor yesterday to pass the safety net and stop playing dog in the manger politics, I call on the Labor Party today to pass this legislation and stop playing dog in the manger politics to the detriment of 35,000 Australian families.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question and his interest in the free trade agreement that we have negotiated with the United States. Of course, there are many sectors of the manufacturing industries in his electorate that will certainly benefit from the free trade agreement. Indeed, this historic agreement will deliver substantial wins for the Australian manufacturing sector. In fact, it removes 99 per cent of all market access impediments or tariffs on manufactured goods into that enormous market in the United States. A number of Australian organisations have identified this already and have welcomed what has been negotiated. Interestingly, the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries - I know that this is an industry that is near the electorate of Deakin and of interest to the member for Deakin - have said that the outcome of negotiations for a free trade agreement with the United States will yield significant opportunities for the Australian car industry to increase exports over the next few years. That is what this is all about: opportunities for Australian industry. The Australian Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers Association have said in their newsletter that the FTA deal is a dynamic agreement, that it sets in place a trading framework and that it sets up the opportunities that are needed for Australian industry.We have been talking to other small manufacturers across Australia. The Attorney-General and member for Berowra would recognise a company by the name of Auto-Bake, from Hornsby, who are already exporting to the United States. They employ 80 people in his electorate. They say that the agreement is `what we've been waiting for to give us the edge over domestic competition'. It is all about opportunities for Australian workers in manufacturing industries across Australia. But of course there are alternative views to those of the FCAI, the AEEMA and companies like Auto-Bake. You would expect them to come from the Australian Labor Party, some of their fellow travellers and, of course, some in the union movement like the AMWU. The AMWU comments, `The US FTA will be bad for Australian manufacturing workers and bad for Australia overall.' That completely contrasts with what manufacturing industries are saying. The ACTU has said:The deal should now be referred to a Senate Inquiry for closer public scrutiny and so we can see if it can be amended and improved or just thrown out.That was before they had even seen it. The ACTU are saying, `Throw it out.' We think we are aware of the position of the Labor Party on this and the Leader of the Opposition's continual reference to the ladder of opportunity. We believe that this free trade agreement with the United States delivers opportunities for Australian workers and Australian business, and the Leader of the Opposition should be very careful if he is going to rely on Doug Cameron and Sharan Burrow to hold up his ladder of opportunity.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for his question. He has looked at the detail of what has been negotiated here and he recognises the significance of the opportunity that is going to be generated and delivered to a very important industry in his electorate - the beef industry. Over the transition period in this agreement, the beef industry will benefit to the tune of $3 billion. The beef industry wanted security and certainty in terms of growth in their market opportunities across the world.That goes to the core of what the government are trying to do as far as our trade policy is concerned. As we continue to beaver away and work with our colleagues to ensure that the multilateral system keeps moving forward, we are also taking opportunities on the bilateral front to ensure that we deliver market access opportunities as Australian industry has the capacity to fulfil them. We did it with New Zealand - the CER with New Zealand was negotiated by a coalition government and signed off on by a Labor government. We did it with Singapore - what we have negotiated over the last couple of years has delivered increased market access opportunities for many of our services sectors such as the legal, financial and education sectors. The Thai free trade agreement will eliminate more than 50 per cent of all tariffs, which accounts for 78 per cent of our exports. Over $700 million worth of Australia's current exports will benefit from those tariff cuts. And this agreement with the United States - we have sales of around $14.5 billion into this market - will remove the impediments of trading into that market. These are all part of the broader picture of building a much stronger economic relationship with our major markets of the world. I should make the point that all those countries with whom we are negotiating bilateral agreements are just as dedicated as Australia to achieving outcomes in the multilateral system in the WTO, yet they are also anxious to move ahead more quickly where we can and deliver benefits to our exporters. With that perspective, it is interesting to note that the Australian Labor Party had no trouble supporting the negotiated outcome with Singapore and they had no trouble supporting the negotiated outcome with Thailand. All we are asking is that, in terms of the national interest, they should -  -  - The interjectors do not know that it is not the same, because they have not seen the agreement yet. When they do, the Australian people will challenge the Labor Party -  - We have related the outcome of this in very clear terms to the Australian people. When the time comes, the Labor Party will be put on the spot to vote for their own political interests or to vote for the national interest in terms of the United States free trade agreement.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question and for his interest in the economy. Today we had the release of the ACCI survey of small business. I know that, as a supporter of small business, the member for Dobell will be pleased to hear that the survey showed that confidence has continued to rise in the small business sector since the beginning of last year. The index remains well above its long-term average and marginally below the highest level recorded, back in August 1999, with sustained improvements in sales, revenue, profits and investment. We also had released today the National Australia Bank monthly business survey, which showed that business confidence was strong. Business confidence rose by six points to an overall reading of plus 19 points in January, although that survey also showed an unexpected fall in business conditions. The National Australia Bank thought that that could have involved a seasonality factor, but it still reports that it is consistent with strong ongoing growth and broadly consistent with domestic demand of around four per cent. So we have the picture of businesses being quite confident in the current environment, which is one of a growing economy, low interest rates, contained inflation, strong employment growth and good consumer confidence generally.I was also asked by the member for Dobell what could threaten that kind of business climate. The most threatening thing for a business climate like that would be an erratic government with an erratic economic policy which got into office and threatened all of the progress that we have been making in Australia over the last eight years. This is obviously something that is now beginning to play on the mind of small business, because, as the ACCI said today, one of the things that could send Australia backwards would be the Labor Party's policy on industrial relations. The ACCI released a statement on 17 February 2004 that concludes:... without major change, the Australian Labor Party's industrial relations platform ... would adversely affect the interests of private employers, and compromise economic development.Why would you want to compromise economic development in this country, except to appease the paymasters of the Australian Labor Party - the ACTU? The ACCI said:The additional costs - which Labor's IR policy - would impose on business through further regulation and heightened trade union activity would have significant implications for jobs and employment.This is something that people have to recognise: Labor's IR policy is a job destroying policy. It will condemn people to the kind of joblessness that we saw under previous Labor governments. One of great reasons why we have had progress in this country over the last eight years is not just a strong economy but that this government has been prepared to do the heavy lifting of economic reform. The ACCI called on the ALP to at least match the policy vision adopted by Prime Minister Keating. That is what it said in its statement today. A lot of people on this side of politics do not think there was much of a policy vision by Prime Minister Keating on industrial relations. We remember the way in which the member for Kingsford Smith, as the then industrial relations spokesman, managed to stare him down after the 1993 election. The ACCI is calling for the Australian Labor Party to at least get back to where it was nine years ago, because the policy which it has adopted is not one just for the last decade; it is one which would take Australia back decades to the period of the Leader of the Opposition's hero - back to the bad days of one of the worst governments this country has ever seen: the Whitlam government. Australia cannot afford to go back to those days. This is the party that builds economic reform for job opportunities, and Labor ought to get out of the way. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowan for his question. Yes, I have invited leaders of the veteran community to Canberra to discuss many issues of concern to my portfolio, as indeed it has been my practice to consult, to discuss and to listen to the leaders of our veteran community - and I will continue to do so. The member for Cowan is quite correct in saying that our response to the Clarke review was going to be one of those subjects for discussion. I will be speaking and meeting with our veteran leaders again at four o'clock this afternoon. But I think it is important for me to take this opportunity to remind members of the Clarke review. It was our election commitment and it is a fulfilment of our commitment. We did actually say -  - One of the promises that we made to the veteran community was that we as a government would not respond to the Clarke review until we heard its responses to those recommendations - and this is exactly what we have done. This government has an excellent track record of conducting reviews into the veterans' affairs portfolio and responding in a very positive way. - I can give the example of our review into the Vietnam veterans, where we committed a further $32 million to the results of that review, and it has been very welcomed by the wider Vietnam veteran community. This government's commitment to the veterans is second to none and it is clear from the figures. In 1996 our commitment to veterans was $6.2 billion. In the last budget, 2003-04, our commitment was a massive $10.1 billion. This government puts its commitment to our veterans where its heart is. In response to the question by the member for Cowan: we will be responding to the Clarke review very shortly. I will be very happy to arrange a personal briefing for the member for Cowan and any other of his colleagues who may be interested. </DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for Casey for his question and for his interest in this issue. I am glad that members on this side of the House have a genuine interest in these issues and are prepared to ask questions about them so that the parliament and the public can give them consideration.There is no doubt that the exposure of the network set up by Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan - who is the so-called father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb - revealed a thriving global black market in nuclear technology. There had been suspicions about this for a very long time. This full exposure is something that the international community took very seriously. It showed that rogue states, middlemen, front companies and deceit were all behind the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. These revelations simply showed that it was not as difficult as many had perhaps hoped to acquire the expertise and materials for weapons of mass destruction. I do not think people on this side of the House need reminding that the greatest of all human nightmares is the possibility of these types of weapons systems falling into the hands of terrorists. If they can be proliferated in the way that Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan had been doing, that is a matter of particular concern.This brings me to what we are doing about it. One of many things that we are doing - and of course as a government we have been very decisive on these issues - is participating with a number of other countries, including the United States, in what is called the Proliferation Security Initiative. This is an initiative designed to find ways of intercepting and interdicting the illegal trade and trafficking in weapons of mass destruction materials. I think it is an enormously important initiative, and I am glad that it is getting so much support around the international community. It was pleasing to hear on 11 February what President Bush had to say about strengthening global counter-proliferation controls. We are taking an active role with the Proliferation Security Initiative. Indeed, we hosted a PSI meeting in Brisbane some months ago, which I attended. Australia was the first country to host a Proliferation Security Initiative exercise last year.Are there any alternative approaches? I would have thought that something like this would obviously be a matter for bipartisanship. I would have thought that all members of the parliament would support this - but apparently not. The member for Griffith has made it clear that he does not support the Proliferation Security Initiative and the opposition does not support it. I can only assume that that is because the Americans are the leaders in the Proliferation Security Initiative - and, wherever the Americans go, the current federal opposition never dares tread. The opposition has an alternative approach, and that is to revive something called the Canberra Commission - which, it might be recalled, was chaired by Richard Butler.  - It does not call for any further comment from me, Mr Speaker. I think we all know what we are all thinking, but all of us look to the dignity of office of Governor-General and Governor and so we say no more.The Canberra Commission produced a report. They had a whole lot of people sitting around and they had a little chat and they produced a report. That was okay; I did not have a problem with it and we promoted the report. I hate to disappoint the opposition but, if you seriously think you are going to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by rogue regimes by getting a few academics to sit around and produce a report, I am afraid that one is not going to work. What is going to work is decisive action. The opposition's opposition to the Proliferation Security Initiative is one of the more bizarre but yet again characteristically anti-American positions that the opposition has been taking.</DOC>

 - I can certainly confirm that I wrote to the then Minister for Family and Community Services in September last year. It did not have the word `secret' on it, but it was an important letter - and, may I say, it was a very good letter, too. It continued the very persistent activity of the government in addressing aspects of the family benefits scheme that certainly do need change and improvement - something we have never denied. In fact, if you look at the record of the current Minister for Family and Community Services - and I had the opportunity just before question time to flick through a few of her news releases on this subject - you find that, from the time she took over as minister, on 29 September last year, she has been very active in finding different ways of further improving the system.I am very pleased to advise the House that preliminary figures now received for the 2002-03 financial year show that the number and size of debts - in other words, overpayments - are beginning to fall. Compared with the same time last year, 14 per cent fewer families have incurred an overpayment.  I think we have to again - as I have invited the member for Lilley to do in the past - look at this issue in perspective. We are talking here about the payment of a benefit which is, in total value, about $11 billion; we are talking about a situation where something like 65 per cent or 66 per cent of payments do not require any refund or involve an overpayment; and we are talking about a totally legitimate mechanism of recovering overpayments.Sometimes these overpayments are by innocent misadventure, sometimes not. Whatever the result is, no government of this country has ever in the past disavowed the notion of recovering overpayments of welfare benefits. When Labor was in office it did not disavow that. No responsible government of the future will disavow the idea of recovering overpayments. The Leader of the Opposition and those behind him can run a populist campaign on this issue if they choose, but in the end it is not in the interests of this country to have a system where an overpayment occurs and no attempt is made in a reasonable fashion to arrange for the refund of those overpayments.As to the legislation which is in the Senate, let me remind the parliament that last year the government put up legislation to extend a top-up arrangement, under which, incidentally, families get an average top-up of $885 a year. There were no top-ups under the legislation of the former government. In 2001-02, 530,000 Australian families received top-up payments. These were families who overestimated their incomes under the family tax benefit rules and were therefore entitled, on reconciliation at the end of the year, to get some more money. Obviously, if those who have overestimated their incomes are entitled at the end of the year to get more money - who in the Labor Party would be heard to deny that proposition? - isn't it reasonable for people who have underestimated their income at the end of the year that some reasonable arrangement be entered into so that they can make a refund?What we did at the end of last year was to put up legislation to extend this top-up arrangement. What this bill does is extend the time limits for making past period claims from family tax benefit and child-care benefit by 12 months, giving families two years in which to make a claim for a past period. Labor Party action in the Senate is blocking this legislation. - The member for Lilley can exercise his neck muscles, but nothing alters the fact that the Labor Party in the Senate is blocking this legislation. It is another example of dog in the manger politics. Let me be charitable to the member for Lilley. What the Labor Party is doing -  -  - You don't want me to be charitable to the member for Lilley?Government members - No! - Gee, you are a very hard-hearted lot, that is all I can say.  - The member for Lilley needs a bit of charity - he really does. He did not do too well a few months ago, so he needs a bit of charity.Let me explain: the Labor Party are pressing for a three-year claim period - why not a five-year claim period; why not a 10-year claim period? - despite advice that, for privacy reasons, all data links between Centrelink and the ATO are severed after two years and, therefore, the data link no longer exists for the 2001 income year. In other words, from a practical point of view it is not possible to go back. The member for Lilley knows that and the Leader of the Opposition knows that. The Labor Party are also pressing for a reconciliation between the income tax and family payment systems to be voluntary. If it is voluntary, that will compromise the integrity of both systems. Once again, you have dog in the manger politics from Labor. They are not in government, so it is, `I can't do it, so I'm not going to let you do it.' They ought to stop blocking benefits to 35,000 Australian families and should get out of the way and, just as they should pass the safety net legislation, they should pass this legislation and bring joy to 35,000 families. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question. I can inform her that the latest figures show the largest quarterly jump in private health insurance membership since the Lifetime Health Cover was first brought in by this government some years ago. That is very important for everyone, because private health insurance is an essential part of a well-functioning health care system in this country. Medicare is the foundation of our health care system, but you cannot have a good public health system without a good private health system to give it support and backup.More than 50 per cent of elective surgery in this country now takes place in private hospitals. If there was any significant reduction in private health insurance membership, there would be a dramatic increase in public hospital waiting lists. Thanks to the policies of this government, private health insurance coverage has increased from 30 per cent to about 40 per cent of the Australian population. That is nine million Australians who enjoy the choice and the security that private health insurance brings. That is nine million Australians who are concerned, who are in a state of anxiety, about the Labor Party's secret plan to rip the guts out of private health insurance.The Labor Party's health platform was 15 pages of platitudes, with not one line in support of the private health insurance rebate. If the Labor Party put a means test on the private health insurance and took it off everyone earning $50,000 a year, it would mean that 4½ million Australians would face a 42 per cent increase in their private health insurance premiums, and that would make the system unviable. If they reduced the rebate to 20 per cent, it would mean that nine million Australians would face an immediate slug of $250 a year, and that too could prejudice the viability of the system. Those nine million Australians need to know where the Labor Party stand on the private health insurance rebate, and it is high time that the member for Werriwa, the Leader of the Opposition, who once described the private health insurance rebate as public policy madness, told us where he stands now. Nine million Australians, including 44,000 people in the electorate of Werriwa, deserve to know where Labor stand so that they can plan their health care future with confidence. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question and say in response to him and to members of the House that, not content with the Centenary House rip-off, which funnels $36 million of Australian taxpayers' money to the Australian Labor Party, the Labor Party now plans to revive one of its other great rorts on the Australian public if elected. When this government was elected it abolished the Trade Union Training Authority, a mechanism by which the Labor Party channelled some $10 million a year to its union mates under the pretext of trade union representative training. We have seen a revision of this by Labor parties in Victoria and New South Wales recently.The Labor Party in government in Victoria has provided some $3 million to the union education foundation, and a similar $3 million has been provided by the Labor Party government of Bob Carr in New South Wales. This is apparently under the guise of training union delegates to better represent the workplace, but that representation and the nature of it was let out of the bag in the ACTU executive minutes of 15 and 16 July 2003, which said in relation to this that the ACTU executive:... authorises the development of programs for delegate and activist education in NSW and Victoria.Here we have another example of the Australian Labor Party ripping off the Australian taxpayer. Here we have a revolving slush fund. In the last year the unions in Australia gave some $5 million to the Australian Labor Party, and here we have the Labor Party governments in New South Wales and Victoria alone returning not $5 million but $6 million for training trade union activists. It is no wonder that the member for Rankin, in his address to the national conference of the Australian Labor Party, said that the Labor Party and the unions are in partnership once again. Had he been accurate, he would have said they are in financial partnership once again. Not only is the $36 million being channelled to the Australian Labor Party - the member for Hotham knows this very well; he has been fairly quiet recently, but he could have done something about this when he was the Leader of the Opposition, and we see the same silence from the new Leader of the Opposition in relation to this - to Centenary House, through a rip-off of the Australian taxpayer, but also we have this revolving slush fund of $5 million. It comes from the unions to the Labor Party and then the Labor Party in government pay it back to the unions. On top of that, $40 million over the last eight years has been channelled by the big union bosses in Australia to the Labor Party. The reality is that the Australian Labor Party - the members sitting opposite - are wholly owned by the big unions in Australia. The unions dictate the policy of the Australian Labor Party, as we saw in the answer to the question to the Treasurer on what business in Australia has said about workplace and industrial relations policy.The Labor Party is not a party that represents workers. We saw at the Australian Labor Party national conference that 58 per cent of the members of the national conference came from unions, when just 17 per cent of Australian workers in the private sector are members of unions. The big union bosses dominate and dictate the Labor Party's policies. It is about time that the Leader of the Opposition stood up against them and stood up for ordinary Australian workers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and trust that he is feeling better. We are in the process of reforming airspace in Australia.Opposition members - Ha, ha! - As a matter of fact, we are. We are on the way to international harmonisation. There are something like 50-odd steps in that process, of which only a limited number have been completed. I stand completely by the view expressed to me by people who are expert in this area -  - and I stand by my own conviction -  - that the National Airspace System will produce better safety outcomes for the travelling public in this country and will allow for a more relevant concentration of finite safety resources in the areas of greatest safety risk. The proposition that, somehow or other, a proven international aviation airspace management system - which is used in a country where there are four times the levels of aviation activity as there are in Australia -   - where the weather is less clement than it is in Australia, and where the aviation safety record is outstanding - is somehow not safe or is less safe than what we have now is palpably nonsense. I remain absolutely consistent in my view that moving to NAS is in the interests of the travelling public of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for his question. The Leader of the Opposition talks about standards in public life. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that the Labor Party receives more money in a month, every month, from Centenary House than it has ever received in any year from the tobacco companies. The Centenary House deal is the all-time great political rip-off. Thanks to the dodgy deal negotiated between the former Labor government and the Australian Labor Party, the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues are receiving a $36 million free gift from the Australian people. Thanks to this dodgy deal, taxpayers are forced to pay more for office space in Canberra than would be paid for prime office space in downtown Manhattan. This is a rolled gold rip-off, it is a triple-funnelled take, it is a copper-bottomed con, and it is fully supported by the Leader of the Opposition, because he has done nothing whatsoever to end the rip-off.The Australian National Audit Office has tried to renegotiate the lease to reflect market reality, but last year the Australian Labor Party told the Audit Office that it could not afford to renegotiate the lease. Let me tell you that in 2002 John Curtin House made an operating profit of $3 million and it gave $2.4 million to the Australian Labor Party. In 2003, John Curtin House made an operating profit of $2.4 million and it gave $1.2 million to the Australian Labor Party. Why shouldn't those profits go back to the taxpayer and not straight into the coffers of the Australian Labor Party? Not only is the Australian Labor Party ripping off the taxpayers of Australia but, on the evidence we have now, it is conning the Australian National Audit Office. There is a term for this. What the ALP is doing, with the connivance of the Leader of the Opposition, is a thinly-disguised money laundering exercise. It is laundering money from the Australian taxpayer to the Australian Labor Party and, if the Leader of the Opposition does not do something about it, he will be revealed not as a new leader but as just another old-fashioned Labor bagman.</DOC>

 - In relation to the question asked by the member for Perth, let me say that it is obviously part of the opposition's strategy to have questions addressed in this matter by those who purportedly were not briefed fully on the issues. In this matter the member for Barton was the subject of a full briefing by the Director-General of Security regarding -  -  - He was the subject of a full -  - The point I was to make was that the member for Barton had a full briefing. In fact, he received exactly the same briefing as I, as Attorney-General, did. It was written advice, and any concerns he had on the matter could have been raised with me or the Director-General of Security. Let me make the point that this is an ongoing investigation by relevant agencies, in which the opposition is fully briefed. When you seek to canvass and traverse the sorts of inquiries that are being undertaken in relation to national security issues, you are taking a highly irresponsible and dangerous course. I do not think it gives the opposition any credit whatsoever for those who are fully briefed to pass information on to those that are not. - </DOC>

 - I have indicated already that certain proposals were put to the government party room yesterday. My colleagues put the view that those proposals should be made even more generous, and I have agreed as a result of that to take the matter back to cabinet. Cabinet will consider the issue when it meets on 1 March, and an announcement will be made shortly afterwards.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question and I would like to say how much I am looking forward to going to his electorate next week. He and I will be able to have a civic conversation with the people in Townsville, but it will be a civic conversation with substance, not just empty rhetoric and cliches. I appreciate the honourable member's concern about Gallipoli. Gallipoli does have a special place in the hearts of all Australians, and thousands visit every year, so we as a government would be very opposed to any measure that would interfere with access to Gallipoli by Australians through the introduction of a charge to get into Gallipoli Peace Park.There is a report in one of our newspapers today suggesting that Turkey is indeed planning to impose a charge. I took the opportunity this morning to speak with the Turkish Ambassador, following up on a call I made to him last Friday. The Turkish Ambassador has already spoken with officials in Ankara, not only in the foreign ministry but in the forestry and environment ministry. In both cases, they have told him that there are no plans whatsoever, either on the part of the foreign ministry or on the part of the ministry for forestry and the environment, to introduce a fee to access Gallipoli Peace Park. I have instructed the Australian Ambassador to Turkey, Mr Philp, to continue to make representations to the Turkish government on this front, because I do not think Australians want to be charged to access Gallipoli Peace Park. I am very reassured by what the Turkish Ambassador has said, which is that the reports we have seen in the newspapers in the last few days are wrong and that Turkey is not proposing to introduce a fee for access to the park.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowan for his question. I am very proud to say that we on this side of the House have a very robust democracy, and it is part of our practice -  - I am also very proud to say that we have a Prime Minister who listens. The honourable member for Cowan is just going to have to wait until we announce our response to the Clarke review. The member for Cowan raises the issue of how we on this side of the House deal with, respond to and respect our veterans. That can clearly be seen in the allocation of funding in this portfolio. In the last budget, a massive $10.1 billion went towards care, welfare, income support and comprehensive health services for our veterans. I might also say that, during the course of my consultations and discussions with the veterans community, many have been asking me recently about the Labor Party point of view on certain issues. That is a very good question because, indeed, the Clarke review has been out for 12 months for their response also. - It is very important to understand that the veteran community is still waiting on the Labor Party's policy for veterans. So far in the eight years that this government has been in office there has been no mention of veterans' affairs policy coming from the other side. Indeed, one would think they would have splinters from sitting on the fence and waiting to see what we are doing on this side of the House in our response to veterans. It is also indicative of the fact that they are a policy vacuum over there - another policy black hole, and this time it is on veterans. As a matter of fact, the only response I am getting from the shadow minister for veterans' affairs and the member for Cowan is to call me names and attack me personally.  - Though I would expect it to come from high school students, the member for Cowan has referred to me as a `flip-flop floozy'. I suggest to the member for Cowan that he gets his mind less on floozies and more on policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question. It relates to a very important policy initiative of the government, and my attention has been drawn recently to some criticism of that program. The criticism was made by the member for Lilley, who is the shadow minister for family and community services. He said it in relation to some statements of support that have been made by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, whose spokeswoman was reported in the Age as saying:Since the start of the strategy, 616 family and community projects have been approved for funding ... Of the projects, 51 per cent are in rural-regional communities, 25 per cent are in indigenous communities, 22 per cent target youth, and 18 per cent provide pathways to jobs.The criticism made by the member for Lilley was quite important in the context of some remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition at the National Press Club today. What the member for Lilley had to say was that the problem with the Stronger Families and Communities program was that there were too many individual programs at a community level. He said:If the money had all been put into a couple of strong national programs, we would have got a better bang for our buck.This is very interesting when compared and contrasted with the remarks made only a few minutes ago by the Leader of the Opposition. He had this to say:So governments need to create the space and the opportunities by which civil society and community politics can thrive.No argument with that - a noble sentiment. He then went on to say, and this is where he is in direct conflict with his own spokesman:To some extent this means giving power away. There is a very strong feeling in our society, a very strong feeling in our politics, that too much power has slipped from the people's grasp and has been concentrated in the hands of big bureaucracies and big corporations.If two decent, big-sized national programs do not represent big bureaucracies or big corporations, nothing else does. The conflict gets even more interesting. I also noticed that the Leader of the Opposition had something to say today about mentoring. There was nothing that the Leader of the Opposition said about mentoring that I could, in principle, disagree with. I close my eyes and I recall almost word for word a few speeches I have made on the subject over the years.I have not only made speeches. I might also point out that not only have I made speeches on this subject but, through a program called the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy, the government has already committed $23 million, not the $2 million mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition, to mentoring and leadership projects. This $23 million - I repeat, $23 million: 10 times the amount acknowledged by the Leader of the Opposition - has gone to these apparently worthless projects, as described by the member for Lilley, such as: the Cairns youth mentoring scheme, $200,000 in the electorate of Leichhardt; the Port Augusta community leadership program, $31,000 in the electorate of Grey; the Great Mates Indigenous youth mentoring project, $140,000 affecting the electorates of Chifley, Greenway, Prospect, Dobell and New England; and the community leaders mentoring program, $300,000 in Bass, Braddon, Denison, Franklin and Lyons.The government also, through the Department of Family and Community Services, administers the $4.4 million Mentor Marketplace program, which funds mentoring organisations such as Big Brothers Big Sisters to the tune of $676,000, the Smith Family to the tune of $150,000, the Create Foundation to the tune of $497,000 and the Youth Off the Streets program in New South Wales to the tune of $150,000. When you add those together you are looking at a sum of between $25 million and $30 million. I welcome the Leader of the Opposition's interest in mentoring. I remind him that they are programs this government has supported and represent a philosophy that this government has supported, and I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that he give his shadow minister a little bit of counselling about what Labor policy is on this subject.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grayndler for his question. I understand that the member for Grayndler has been out making all sorts of accusations again today, and I would just like to put the record straight. I brought into the chamber with me -  - If you would just be quiet and listen, I will. - The question, to remind the deputy opposition leader, was: what were the figures based upon that people tendered on? I brought with me the request for tender, which was the document presented in September 2002 to businesses looking to tender for Job Network. In that document, those figures are 780,000 job seekers. Those businesses then went out and tendered. When they had been assessed by the department, the document that I have with me, a public document, was then put out to everyone who did tender so that they could make a decision upon whether or not to take up those offers of contract. The figure in that document was 720,000 job seekers; in other words, that was the potential for the market - a reduction of some 60,000 since September the year before. Why a reduction? Simply because unemployment had come down - something that this government actually applauds - and the figures said that it was going to come down even further.So the accusations that the member for Grayndler has been out and about with today are totally unfounded. I direct you to the request for tender and also the separate document which was provided to all of those that were looking to tender for Job Network. The figure was 720,000. What is the figure today? The figure today is just under 800,000. Just over 790,000 job seekers are available for assistance through the Job Network because this government has actually extended the assistance to people like those with disabilities, those from single families and those young people who are striving to get into the labour market. Why? Because we believe in giving people an opportunity. - They are public documents, and I am happy to table them. It is the request for tender and the second document as put out by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question. Of course, the member for Grey knows only too well of the economic benefits to the Australian economy that will flow from an Australia-United States free trade agreement. Last week we had the opportunity to visit some of his constituents in Port Lincoln who are going to be direct beneficiaries of the 35 per cent tariff reduction on canned tuna into the US market. In fact, on the basis of media reports, that company is already receiving requests for information about purchasing some of that product from Australia.This is a historic deal that is going to secure real, bankable and tangible benefits for the Australian economy - which fits in very well with the economic agenda that our government has been running since 1996. This is about linking our economy with the biggest, strongest and most robust economy in the world - an economy that is one-third of the world's GDP, almost $10 trillion, and a market of over 285 million people. This agreement is an example of how we as a government are taking decisions in the national interest that will continue to generate new opportunities for Australians today and well into the future.This agreement links in well with the economic strategy that we have put in place that has delivered low interest rates, low inflation and the lowest levels of unemployment in about 22 years. It goes well in sync with what we have done in terms of creating over one million jobs since we came to office in 1996. This strategy will deliver more jobs in many more Australian industries. It is a well-known fact that one in five jobs across the Australian economy rely on exports. In rural and regional Australia one in four jobs rely on exports. So it is important that we continue to expand the opportunities for Australian exporters.I had the opportunity this morning to talk with horticultural exporters at the Footscray markets in Melbourne. They told me that they are very supportive of what we have negotiated here because it is going to give them increased opportunities in terms of exporting into the US market products that they are already exporting and products that they can export now that we are going to bring those tariffs down. An example are the citrus exports that go to the United States, which saved a lot of the citrus operations in Australia. Mr Speaker, you know only too well how important the exports to the US are for the citrus growers in your electorate. They are going to receive the benefit of a total elimination of the tariff on that product from the time this free trade agreement enters into force.It is a pity that the Labor Party is opposing the free trade agreement with the United States - obviously because of their anti-Americanism. But our government will continue to create economic opportunities for industries, particularly exporting industries in Australia. We will continue to pursue this deal on behalf of all Australians to deliver more opportunities for Australia's exporters and more opportunities for more Australians to get more jobs.</DOC>

 - Let me just reiterate for you that the figures as stated in the documents that I have already tabled were accurate. -  - The question from the member for Grayndler and noise from the Leader of the Opposition indicates that perhaps the Labor Party is starting to move away from assisting people just because they are not on benefits. This government does not do that. In fact, under contract 2 - and right throughout Job Network and its predecessor - personnel, such as young people, who cannot be compelled to come in to a Job Network member, are assisted. If the opposition is arguing that they should not be assisted, come forward and say so. If you think that single parents should not be assisted, then say so. If you think people with disabilities should not be assisted, then say so. These are people who cannot be compelled to come in to have interviews but who we on this side of the House, the government, believe have a need to be assisted so that that they can reach their potential in society. The Job Network and the Howard government stand ready to help them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Indi for her question and her interest in Australia's export industries. It has been a difficult period over recent years for Australia's export industries. We had the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the US recession of 2001 and the global downturn. We had SARS, which affected Australia's tourist industry, and the worst recorded drought in 100 years which Australia was going through last year.But there is some brighter news for Australia's export industries at the moment. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics released its latest crop report for February yesterday forecasting a winter crop to be a record 39.4 million tonnes in 2003-04. Get a load of this: 39.4 million tonnes, up 22.4 million tonnes on last year's crop. You are getting a strong recovery coming off what was the worst drought in 100 years in this country. We have had record harvests in Victoria and Western Australia. The wheat production is forecast to rise 148 per cent on last year's production to around 24.9 million tonnes, and barley is forecast to rise 130 per cent on last year's drought-stricken crop. That is very good news. In addition to that, it appears as if global recovery is being established with the recovery of the US economy from recession.Our exporters are facing the difficulty of a rising exchange rate. The Australian dollar is at high levels on a historical basis and has appreciated something like 30 or 40 per cent over the last 14 months. So, although the markets are coming back and production is coming back, the exchange rate is making it a little more difficult for Australia's exporters. What can we do to help our exporters? One of the things this government did is it took all taxes off exports. That was what the new tax system was all about. If the Labor Party had had its way, we would still be taxing exporters in this country because the Labor Party could not see Australia's long-term national interest.Let me make another point: I hope the Labor Party does not fall again for the same backward-looking policy in relation to free trade agreements. One of the things that we can do for our exporters is to give them better opportunities to get their goods and services into new markets. There are countries all around the world that are seeking free trade agreements with the United States - this is a country that has achieved one.That is why we call on the Australian Labor Party to endorse the national interest and to give help to those Australian exporters who will be better off as a result of that agreement. Manufacturers will be better off. People in the car and parts industries, people in electrical goods industries and people in high-tech industries will be better off, as will people in creative industries, in service industries and in professions. People in areas like dairy, wheat and beef will be better off. The free trade agreement is good for Australia's exporters. Our exporters deserve assistance; they are battling in difficult international situations and they deserve the support that this free trade agreement can give them.</DOC>

 - I will answer the question asked by the member for Melbourne. It is true that the chairman of Telstra, Mr Mansfield, canvassed with me, on behalf of the government, a proposal involving Telstra; its subsidiary, Sensis; and the Fairfax company. I told him that the government, having particular regard to the rights of minority shareholders - and in this case there are millions of Australians who are minority shareholders - would not seek to intervene in the matter. It was something for board consideration if the proposal developed further. The issue had not at that time been taken to the board. I discussed the matter with the Treasurer, who indicated to me that he fully shared the view that I had communicated to Mr Mansfield.Let me take this opportunity to say that this issue again highlights the idiocy of the present ownership arrangements for Telstra. It demonstrates that, for so long as the Labor Party continues to oppose the sale of the rest of Telstra, it is destroying the value of the assets of millions of Australians. What the Labor Party has done is place unreasonable fetters on the activity of the company. The company cannot issue new share scrip to raise capital. It has, as some people have described it, a lazy balance sheet, because of very large accumulations of capital. One of the things it can logically do is find major investments which provide certain synergies with its own capacity and its own operation.The Labor Party can run a populist line in relation to this, but the truth of the matter is that, if we as the majority shareholder were to seek to deny the right of the board of Telstra to make a commercial decision that it believes to be in the interests of the company, we would be being absolutely derelict in relation to the rights of minority shareholders. This possibility has been canvassed before. It is an open secret that Telstra several years ago expressed an interest in the acquisition of another media company, and the same view was taken by the government at that time as has been taken on this occasion. The fault lies not with the decision of the government; the fault lies with the refusal of the Labor Party to recognise that it is against the long-term interests of millions of Australian shareholders to maintain the current ownership structure of Telstra. - Yes. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Flinders for his question. He does an excellent job following the great issues that the country faces, rather than just mouthing empty cliches. The opposition may not be aware of this, but countries in our region are actually very interested in doing bilateral free trade agreements. They are interested in doing them around the region, and they are interested in doing free trade agreements with the United States. Singapore has negotiated a free trade agreement with the United States, and Thailand is about to begin such negotiations.I know that, more generally, there is a view in the region, not universally held but largely held, that whilst everybody supports a great WTO round - I do not think anybody on earth argues with that; if we could get the perfect multilateral outcome and turn the whole world into a free trade area that would be a wonderful thing - in the meantime the very best we might be able to do, at least in the short term, is to set up regional and bilateral free trade agreements. That is why so many countries in the region are doing this.The only political movement I have come across in this part of the world, outside of fringe groups, that opposes free trade agreements is the Australian Labor Party. I noticed today that the Leader of the Opposition was asked at the Press Club after his famous speech there - a speech that would have to be close to the most cliche ridden speech I have ever heard; I was reeling from listening to his fusillade of cliches - whether he supported a free trade agreement with the United States. It was perfectly clear from his answer that he does not.The argument of the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party has now boiled down to an argument about models. The Leader of the Opposition was arguing somehow that his model has come unstuck. Mr Speaker, let me tell you and the House something about models. There are two models on this free trade agreement: the government model, which over a period of 11 years will give us greater access to the wine market of the United States, and the Labor model, which will keep us out. There is the coalition's model, which will allow Holden utes to be sold in the USA with their tariffs cut immediately from 25 per cent to zero, and there is the Labor model, which will keep those tarriffs at 25 per cent. There is our model - the government's model - where fruit and flower growers and seafood exporters will see their barriers to the United States come down and massive new markets open up, and there is the Labor model, which does not want to see that access to those markets.I think the Australian public will have a very clear view about which of these two models is the best model. They certainly will not be impressed with an opposition which is purblind to the advantages of trade liberalisation through a free trade agreement with the United States. And why is that? It is because deep down in the opposition there is an anti-Americanism which has welled up in opposition to this free trade agreement. Rational people would not oppose getting this sort of access to the biggest market in the world, but people who are dominated by anti-American ideology would.</DOC>

 - Let me just say this: I think it is an extraordinary thing, and I think the House would agree, that the Labor Party - which has been asking questions, including today, about leaked documents and has been producing leaked documents - thinks that it is all very well to use a leaked document itself but if some other document is leaked somewhere else that is an outrage. I must say I found it very hard to understand the logic of the Labor Party's approach to this issue. - Mr Speaker -  - As I understand it from my recollection of this discussion last year, when questions were asked and I looked into this matter, the Federal Police are apparently investigating this. All of these issues will be examined by the Federal Police, and that is absolutely fine by me.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. I know how concerned she is to ensure that patients at Wollongong Hospital get access to proper cancer treatment immediately. As members of the House will know, the Commonwealth provides 50 per cent of public hospital funding, but public hospital policy and administration are wholly the responsibility of state governments. Despite the GST, state health spending has been static at about two per cent of GDP since 1996. At the same time, federal health spending has grown from 3.7 per cent to 4.3 per cent of Australia's GDP. As far as is humanly possible, I want to work cooperatively with the state governments to provide better health services, but that is very difficult when the state governments do not provide the public hospitals with enough money to keep basic services going.Some time ago, the Commonwealth agreed to fund a new linear accelerator to treat cancer patients at Wollongong Hospital. But I regret to inform the House that the $3.9 million provided by the Commonwealth has already been spent on hospital administration, and no linear accelerator has been purchased. In a letter to the New South Wales government, the Chief Executive Officer of the Illawarra Area Health Service said:In the Illawarra Health Service, the total unfunded expenditure is $6,993,000. Furthermore, the Commonwealth government grant moneys of $3.9 million for the linear accelerator has been spent. This money has been previously allocated to rectify previous budget deficits.I table this letter, which reveals how money destined for Wollongong cancer patients has been filched because the state government has not lived up to its responsibilities in this area. I call on the New South Wales government to make good these moneys now and buy a linear accelerator immediately.I note that the boards of Camden and Campbelltown hospitals sought an injunction recently to stop the publication of the Health Care Complaints Commission report exposing 19 deaths through negligence at those hospitals. I also note that Alex Sanchez, who was part of the board that tried to cover this up, has just joined the staff of the Leader of the Opposition. If the Leader of the Opposition were serious about contributing to solving the health care problems of this country, he would stop covering up for the Carr government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Isaacs for her question. I did not attack, in a generic way, all government schools. -  - I did not, Mr Speaker. But if the honourable member is asking me to retract in any way what I said, let me tell her that I will not retract what I said, because what I said I believed, what I said was accurate, and what I said reflected -  - the views of many parents which have been expressed to me. If we want to have a serious debate about the quality of services provided in this country, the first thing that we have to acknowledge and recognise is that people's views in relation to services are grounded on their own experience. In the interview, which was conducted with Samantha Maiden of the Australian newspaper, I was asked why I believed that over the past few years there had been such a heavy drift of people into private schools from public schools, as witnessed by an increase of about 1.6 per cent in public school enrolments versus about 13 per cent in independent enrolments. I said that, in speaking to people, many of the views they expressed to me went to issues of standards, values and discipline. They were views that were expressed, and I do not resile from that, because we will not have an intelligent debate about this issue -  - I notice from a report that was released on behalf of the federal education department a few days ago that the two things cited most frequently in relation to choices regarding independent versus government schools were issues of discipline and values. As this is an acceptable age to recount personal experience, I say this as somebody who went through a government school and educated my own children at a primary level in government schools and whose experience has been that there are some excellent government schools and excellent government school teachers but there are also some who are too heavily influenced by the Australian Education Union, whose values are driven by the politically correct.We had a classic example of that - I really do thank the honourable member for Isaacs for asking me this question - at the weekend, when the Australian Education Union launched its campaign, which quite dishonestly omitted to inform the Australian people that 50 per cent of all of the money that state governments raise in this country comes from the federal government. Any fair comparison of funding of education in this country would acknowledge that, whereas 68 per cent of children are educated in government schools, 76 per cent of all taxpayers' money, from both state and federal sources, goes to government schools. The reality is that every time parents in Australia decide to send their children to independent schools they save the Australian taxpayer something like an amount of $10,000 annually. If they decide to send their children to what the opposition pleases itself to call an `elite' private school - although many of the parents of children at private schools are categorised as anything but elite in terms of their income levels - what they are effectively doing is saving the taxpayer in the order of $7,000 out of that $10,000. If they send them to a low-fee Catholic school, a Christian school or one of the other low-fee independent schools, the expenditure saving is a great deal less, because the level of government subsidy is much higher.We have a splendid system of choice between government and independent schools in this country. It is a world-class system; it is envied by many countries around the world; it has been the subject of discussion in many of the talks I have had not only with President Bush and the British Prime Minister but also with the leaders of many other countries. The bottom line of what the Labor Party is about in this area is the agenda of the Australian Education Union. The agenda of the Australian Education Union is to destroy the consensus we have about funding both government and independent schools. Talk about shifting from the so-called wealthy schools to other schools is the thin end of the wedge for overturning three decades of bipartisan support for both government and independent schools in this country.</DOC>

 - Total employment has grown in this country by 1.3 million since the election of the Howard government in 1996. That is 1.3 million Australians who now have an opportunity; 1.3 million Australians who have a future. That is something that this side of the House is very proud of. Since March 1996 the number of unemployed has actually gone down by 150,000. The number of long-term unemployed - those people who have been unemployed for longer than 12 months - has gone down by 80,000. Since 1 July 2003, with the introduction of the Job Network contract 3, there have been some 270,000 helped into work. In the member for Hinkler's electorate the number is nearly 4,000.If you compare this to Labor's failed alternative, the CES, in helping disadvantaged job seekers you find that their failed system helped only 27.4 per cent into work; whereas the Job Network is helping nearly double that number - 46.6 per cent. What is the cost? The cost under the CES was a massive $12,800 for each of those outcomes, and today the figure is $3,900. That is $3,900 for an outcome compared to Labor's alternative, which was $12,800. No matter what measure you wish to use, the Job Network is working and working effectively for Australians.. But what about the opposition? A cursory glance at the ALP draft national platform indicates that the Labor Party wishes to reintroduce a public provider, the CES - the CES that drives outcomes down and costs up, which disadvantages job seekers and in fact -  - The member for Grayndler says it does not say that. - Can I suggest that the member for Werriwa, when he is reading one of his books, reads it to one of those on his front bench and reads to him the bit in there that says you are after a public provider. Not only does it say he wants a public provider but the Labor Party also has another solution - publicly funded jobs. That is right: if you cannot get real jobs in the real labour market and drive up the economy, then why don't the government and the taxpayer fund them! The last of their three ideas is: `Let's introduce unions into the Job Network. Let's have some jobs for the boys. So maybe we can pump the money into the Job Network, which is owned by the unions, and the unions can then give it back to the ALP.' We have heard this tired old story many times before. A public provider, driving down outcomes and driving up costs, giving the money back to the unions, not helping unemployed Australians. It is no wonder unemployment peaked at over one million under the Labor Party. - Yes. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for asking this question. I might have expected it from the member for Lilley, because the first thing I want to say is that this government supports all 26,000 employees of Centrelink; they do a fantastic job. Contrast that to the spin coming out from the member for Lilley in particular, who uses any excuse to attack the government by attacking the staff of Centrelink.The proposition that was put by the member for Oxley, based on the manipulation that the member for Lilley did over the weekend, is that the 26,000 employees of Centrelink are making a huge number of errors. Let us put this into perspective. There was an internal survey conducted by Centrelink - to their credit - to look at ways of trying to improve their performance. They went to 1,200 of their clients who had a perceived problem with Centrelink and asked them where any errors may have occurred. It was a survey done of people who had a perceived error, so it was a distorted sample anyway. But the member for Lilley extrapolated that sample to represent the 6.3 million customers that Centrelink serves over a total of 4.2 billion transactions. What the Australian Labor Party is doing is running down the 26,000 employees of Centrelink who, under difficult circumstances at times, do an outstanding job in allocating and distributing over one-third of the Commonwealth budget.There was a survey, particularly about accuracy, done by the Department of Family and Community Services. Of course the government is always concerned about accuracy and makes no apologies for that: people should get their entitlement, not more, not less. But when you look at the actual assessment of income paid under that survey by the department, 96.7 per cent of Centrelink transactions were assessed as accurate.We do not dispute that sometimes incorrect information may be processed. I will give you some of the examples that the member for Lilley was using to twist the argument. He should apologise, quite frankly, to the 26,000 employees of Centrelink. He uses them as a political pawn to make hits on the government. It is outrageous to put that slur on those employees. Here is one perceived mistake: having to use a redundancy payment before having access to Centrelink payments. Some people think we should not have to use our redundancy payments and that we should automatically be able to access Centrelink payments. It has always been the policy of this government and of previous governments that people should use up their own liquid assets before they are entitled to Commonwealth grants.Here is another example of a perceived error: receiving two letters on the same issue. We appreciate that sometimes this can be annoying for customers - we recognise that. But I hardly think sending two letters to a particular customer is worth damning the employees of Centrelink - although the member for Lilley is quite happy to think so. Those employees do a difficult job, they do a great job and it is about time you stopped running them down. As the previous minister for employment mentioned, Centrelink is a far better organisation than the old CES ever was.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston. I can tell him that the budget forward estimates make provision for $445 million for the construction of the Scoresby Freeway. I want to acknowledge the work that he has done on that issue, together with the member for Deakin, the member for Dunkley and the member for Casey. I want to reaffirm that this government is not only committed to the Scoresby Freeway but has provided money in the forward estimates for its construction.We did that after signing an agreement with the Victorian government called the Scoresby Transport Corridor. Clause 3(a) of this agreement reads as follows:... Victoria agrees to provide 50% of Government costs for the construction of a freeway - a freeway - between Ringwood and Frankston ...Clause 3(d) of this agreement provides:Victoria undertakes to ensure that users of the Scoresby Freeway will not be required to pay a direct toll.There it is in writing: they will not be required to pay a direct toll. Lest there is any doubt about that, the Victorian Premier, Mr Bracks, wrote a personally addressed letter to the residents in the area before the state election in 2002. Under the heading, `Bracks listens, acts. ALP' it said this:... Labor will build the Scoresby Freeway on time and on budget. These are not just election time promises, they are my firm commitments to you and your family and they will be honoured.Since writing that letter and being re-elected, since signing that written agreement, since being provided with that $445 million, in what must be the most breathtaking blatant breach of an election promise, the Bracks Labor government has said it is going to toll the Scoresby Freeway. Shame! Shame on it! It will not produce its $445 million. It will not honour that agreement. It will not honour that letter. It will put a toll on every person using that Scoresby Freeway.Why does this all come to mind today? Today I have been given a copy of a flier which Labor members are putting out in the area of Scoresby. Mr Speaker, you think you have seen it all - but, when you see a document like this, you say to yourself, `It's just all beginning.' Labor state members, who are a party to that broken agreement and that broken letter, are today in the Scoresby area handing out fliers with the headline `Tolls are good: prove us wrong'. Peter Lockwood, the member for Bayswater, and Dympna Beard, the member for Kilsyth, invite you to attend a special breakfast with transport minister, Peter Batchelor. `Bring your questions to this one,' they say. Have a listen to this: `Hear why tolls are good for business.' When you go down there, you can hear why tolls are good for your business, why more union power is good for your business, how unfair dismissal laws are good for your business, how increased company taxes are good for your business, how Labor is good for your business - and how tolls are good for your business. `Tolls are good: prove us wrong.' I tell you what: if I can get free on that day, I am going. Tell Pete I will be down there with all my group.I think what ought to happen here is for federal Labor to engage state Labor in a civic conversation. That is what I think. I think federal Labor ought to go down and have a civic conversation and say, `Listen, you've signed an agreement; listen, you've put out a letter and you've got an obligation' - and I mean a civil conversation. I do not want anybody's collarbone to be broken in this conversation. I want it to be civil. I want to see federal Labor go down to state Labor and say, `Why don't you keep your promises? Do the right thing by the people of Scoresby.'</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Newcastle for her question. When she speaks about employment, I suppose the first thing I would remind her and her constituents in Newcastle of is that in March 1996 the unemployment rate in Newcastle was double what it was towards the end of last year. So, in terms of actual jobs for people in the Newcastle area, which she is obviously concerned about, under this government there has been a massive increase in jobs in the area and a substantial reduction in unemployment.  - Indeed, the member for Charlton might be interested in the fact that unemployment in her electorate has fallen from 13.3 per cent to under seven per cent - tell that to your constituents. - If the member for Prospect does not believe that a job is an entitlement, then that sums up the Australian Labor Party. This government has a proud record of having put in place the GEERS scheme which provides for workers, according to the community standard, upon redundancy. This is something which this government has funded and which Labor governments around the states have not funded or made any contribution to. The only suggestion from the Labor Party is a private member's bill - which has come from the member for Prospect, who was noisy a few moments ago - which adds further payroll tax to employers and small businesses throughout Australia. So here we have a proposition being moved by the Australian Labor Party, through the Chief Opposition Whip, to increase taxes for Australian businesses. That is the response of the Australian Labor Party. However, we will get on with the job of creating more jobs in Australia - something which it seems the Australian Labor Party does not care about. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mackellar for her question and I appreciate the interest that she has taken in this particular rort and racket that has been occurring over many years. Just today at the National Press Club we had no other person than the Leader of the Opposition himself claim that the Labor Party's conduct in respect of Centenary House had been fully vindicated by a 1994 royal commission. But the key statements of fact relied on by that royal commission have all turned out to be wrong - absolutely every key statement of fact has turned out to be wrong. For instance, the commission said:... it appears that rents are likely to rise at the rate of about 9% in Barton ...The fact is that growth in the intervening period of time in Barton has been between two and three per cent a year. The report of the commission said:No party to the lease of Centenary House obtained unfair or above-market commercial advantage from the lease.If that is the case, why is the Audit Office paying $871 per square metre and the commercial tenant in that same building paying just $314 a square metre? Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition might like to tell us what the Labor Party is paying in Centenary House. Every day, the Australian Labor Party is receiving a free gift from the taxpayer of $6,721 above market rent. In the 78 daysthat the member for Werriwa has been the opposition leader, the ALP has trousered $524,238. It just goes on and on.Today at the National Press Club the Leader of the Opposition said that he was not really interested in the past, he was only interested in the future. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that, by the end of June, the Labor Party will have pocketed another $800,000 because of this extortion racket. We on this side of the House are prepared to let the past be forgotten and to let bygones be bygones, provided he ends the ripoff now.The Leader of the Opposition said in the past - and I know the past is another country; he has been born again, and everyone has forgotten all his sins of the past - that the hangers-on and the mercenaries need to be sent packing. That is what he said in the past. I say: send the mercenaries packing for the future by renegotiating this lease now. He also said in the past, `We have too much machine politics. This is why we lost two elections under Kim Beazley.' I say: send the machine men packing for the future and renegotiate this lease now. Has he forgotten what he said just yesterday? Just yesterday he told the Labor caucus that he wanted a more ethical approach to politics. He should prove that is what he is going to deliver by renegotiating this lease now.</DOC>

 - I certainly agree completely with the proposition that parents should know where their children are. In fact, two or three months ago on Adelaide radio I was asked about some street disturbances which had occurred in South Australia and I expressed that view. I think one of the reasons that children run riot in the streets is that parents are too selfish about pursuing their own pleasures and too indifferent to their responsibilities as parents to do anything about it. My view about these things is that 98 per cent of parents do the right thing, and they do not need to be told by me, the Leader of the Opposition or anybody else how to bring up their children. I think it is very important to get the balance right in these things. Average Australian parents do not need a lecture from people in public office about how to bring up their children. They do not need lectures from politicians; they do not need lectures from social workers; they do not need lectures from anybody, because they know how to do it and, in fact, they resent any suggestion that somebody is going to come along, Big Brother like, and say, `This is how you have to do it.'As to the rest, I believe very strongly that you need early intervention policies which identify the families at risk from the very beginning. There are some families where the kids do not have a chance from the time they are born, because their parents are living in a dysfunctional situation. The best way to help those people is to have early intervention programs. Quite a number of those programs have been funded under our Stronger Families and Communities Strategy.As for the Western Australian model, as the Leader of the Opposition describes it, I do not know a lot about the detail of it. I am not going to commit myself to supporting it or opposing it. I will get some more information about it. But I think if we are to have a sensible dialogue or community discussion on these matters we have to understand that the overwhelming majority of parents in Australia are doing a wonderful job, and they do not thank people in high office for telling them how to do their job.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for his question. My attention has been drawn to some remarks attributed to Sheikh Hilali, the Grand Mufti of Australia and imam of Sydney's Lakemba mosque. He is reported as having called for a jihad against the state of Israel. He is also reported as having visited the leader of Hezbollah, the military wing of which has been banned in Australia. There were also some other remarks attributed to him that I will not comment on.If these reported marks are correct, or in substance correct, then I think what Sheikh Hilali has said deserves to be condemned in the strongest possible terms. Incitement to a jihad against the state of Israel is utterly unacceptable coming from the leader of any community in this country. If those remarks have been made, I condemn them on behalf of the government - and, I would hope, on behalf of the Australian people - in the strongest possible terms.As to the visit to the leader of Hezbollah, it is true that the organisation banned in Australia is the military wing of Hezbollah, but I would put it to the House that, given that it has been banned in Australia and given that the person in question, Sheikh Hilali, is an Australian citizen and the leader of a community of some 300,000 Australian citizens, he has therefore behaved with incredible insensitivity towards the feelings of many Australians.I strongly welcome the remarks of the President of the Islamic Council of Victoria, who said that Sheikh Hilali, although entitled to his personal opinion, did not speak for Australian Muslims. The question of whether or not he speaks for Australian Muslims does not alter the fact that he holds this position, and it is in the interests of hundreds of thousands of Islamic Australians that, if the remarks attributed to him have not been made, he make that clear. If the remarks have been made then those Islamic Australians and many other Australians should join in condemning him for having made those remarks.We are a nation that strives and prays for peace in the Middle East. Peace in the Middle East will not be achieved by exhortations to violence. There has to be restraint on both sides; there has to be restraint by the Israelis and restraint by the Palestinians and those who support them. As a long-time supporter and friend of the state of Israel, I find these remarks about Israel offensive whenever made - as, indeed, I would find offensive similar remarks about the people of the Palestinian state. We are all sick in our hearts at the death and destruction in the Middle East, and it behoves every Australian citizen to exercise moderation in their language wherever they may be. If the reported remarks have not been made by Sheikh Hilali he has an opportunity to repudiate them. But if they have been made he deserves to be unconditionally condemned.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his question, but he will have to be patient and await the outcome of our deliberations on the Clarke review. All those considerations will be taken into account by this government. We are a government that does support our veteran community. We have special provisions in our veterans entitlements legislation that completely compensate those special POWs. They get a very privileged pass. I might also say to the Leader of the Opposition that yesterday I raised the issue of no support for the veterans coming from the Labor side. I might say that, when the Leader of the Opposition was on his bus tour around New South Wales and he was asked about veterans, he said, `Yes, I think I have to think about that.'</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question. I recognise the interest that he shows in this issue. The government tries to maximise Australia's opportunities through trade and investment agreements. We do it regionally, we do it bilaterally, and we obviously do what we can to enhance the multilateral agenda through the WTO. We are engaging our regional partners in a very substantial way. For example, progress is being made towards achieving the APEC Bogor goals through our closer economic partnership with the ASEAN countries - the AFTA-CER closer economic partnership. This is important. We have made it clear to the ASEAN countries that we would be happy to negotiate a free trade agreement with ASEAN, and that is still on the table for them. At this stage, they have negotiated a closer economic partnership with us. With China we have a scoping study now getting under way to consider a free trade agreement; with Japan we have the TILF - the trade and investment liberalisation framework - being considered; with Singapore there is a free trade agreement; and with Thailand there is the conclusion of a free trade agreement. It is a comprehensive approach and a comprehensive package that we bring, and we add to that with the free trade agreement with the United States of America. I would not have thought that any of that was terribly controversial. I would have thought it was a good example of the way this government works: commonsense, advancement of the national interest - in this case through a pragmatic approach to trade agreements. The opposition have a completely different approach. They are silent, they do not say anything, about most of these trade agreements. They used to, when they were once in government - particularly, they talked about APEC - but now they are silent on these issues. The American free trade agreement was singled out by the opposition, when the results of the negotiations were announced a couple of weeks ago, as an agreement that the Labor Party would be opposing. The Leader of the Opposition said at the time, `If we were asked to vote on it today or in the parliament tomorrow, we would be opposing it.'I was interested yesterday when the Leader of the Opposition started to change the Labor Party's position. It reminds me very much of his first week as the Leader of the Opposition. He came to office with a long record of invective against the United States, very personal criticisms of the President of the United States, and by the end of the week he was in the caucus room wrapped in the Star-Spangled Banner. It is an extraordinary sort of Jekyll-and-Hyde personality that is coming through - Dr Jekyll out there attacking the United States, suddenly Mr Hyde wrapping the flag around himself. We had Dr Jekyll at the beginning of last week, totally opposed to the free trade agreement. After looking at the speech he gave yesterday, I would not be surprised if the Leader of the Opposition sets up some sort of `Dear Mark' column in the newspaper - there he is, becoming Mr Hyde.I think that when voters go to the next election and consider the Leader of the Opposition as the prospective Prime Minister, they will be wondering if, in the first week after the election, they will get Dr Jekyll or Mr Hyde. They certainly will not be sure what they will get.</DOC>

 - Can I genuinely say that I welcome the question from the member for Hotham and that we welcome him back into the parliamentary arena. Can I also say that we think he has elevated the policy on the shadow frontbench in the Treasury portfolio quite considerably since his appointment. In relation to the National Australia Bank, the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority issued a media release on 13 January 2004, indicating that they had been advised by the National Australia Bank of the question of foreign currency trades. They also notified my office on that day, and I was briefed on the matter a day afterwards. That was the day after the National Australia Bank disclosed this matter. - Let me go over the answer again, because the member for Hotham interjects, asking, `When were you aware?' The National Australia Bank apparently became aware on 13 January, or the day before, and notified the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, which issued a media release on 13 January and informed my office at the time by way of telephone conversations, and a briefing was received by me on 14 January. So the National Australia Bank disclosed it to the regulator and the regulator disclosed it to me.The member for Hotham asked a question as to what APRA has done in relation to this matter. The National Australia Bank has set up an inquiry by PricewaterhouseCoopers. I do not believe the inquiry has yet finished but, when it has, the inquiry report will be given to APRA, which is being kept informed all the way through. The member for Hotham asks what action has been taken. The chief executive and the chairman have resigned, which to me indicates that the National Australia Bank -  - has taken this seriously. The Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority will be acting under PricewaterhouseCoopers report, once it is given, and taking all steps in accordance with it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question. I know that, prior to entering this parliament, the member for Petrie was actively involved in small business in Queensland, particularly in the seafood industry. I am sure she will be interested to know that, according to the Australian Seafood Industry Council, when we open up that market as a result of this free trade agreement with the United States, $140 million worth of our exports will be entering the United States market duty free. That is, I am sure, good news for the member for Petrie and for the industry she was involved in prior to entering this place.It is important to note also that, as the minister for small business often reflects, since the departure of Senator Barney Cooney from the Labor Party ranks in the parliament there is nobody left in the Labor Party with any connections to or roots in the small business community of Australia. So it is little wonder that we see the attitude of the Australian Labor Party to the proposed free trade agreement with America, and to the benefits that can accrue to small business in Australia. About 6,000 Australian companies, 95 percent of which are SMEs, export to the markets of the United States of America under the current arrangements. That is set to grow - we are going to give them far greater opportunities. The free trade agreement is unquestionably about strengthening the stability of small business in our community. Following the announcement of the FTA, Christine Gibbs Stewart, from Australian Business Ltd, commented as follows:This is a very good agreement for Australian small businesses wanting to be in the US market.Australian Business Ltd represents a lot of small businesses across Australia. Just the other day we heard of a processor in Melbourne that is going to be able to sustain their jobs and grow their business into the US market. Symex Holdings, a Melbourne based manufacturer of fatty acids used in the production of soaps and the like, said that the US market for fatty acids is worth about $250 million - the removal of all duties on their exports to the United States will be worth $5 million to $10 million annually to that company. That is all about sustaining jobs and growing the job base in small business in Australia, and that is what we are focusing on.Yesterday I announced that Austrade would be establishing a US FTA task force with specific responsibility for facilitating existing small business into the US market and new small business operators that want to access the US market through our Austrade offices in seven locations across the United States. We are committed to ensuring that, out of this deal, small business benefits the most and that the people who work in those small businesses across Australia benefit the most.We have heard the comments from the Labor Party, particularly those of the Leader of the Opposition, which indicate to us that Labor does not understand the significance of this free trade treatment to small business. We can see that Labor does not understand the importance of small business to the Australian economy. The Leader of the Opposition's immediate reaction when we announced the conclusion of the negotiations on this deal was that the free trade agreement `from our assessment this morning, is not in Australia's interests'. That is what the Leader of the Opposition said. Yesterday, at the Press Club, he started to move away from that position a little and be a bit more flexible in his language.The question still remains: does the Australian Labor Party really understand how important this free trade agreement is to the small business operators of Australia and the people who work in those small businesses across Australia? We know that Labor is opposed to the free trade agreement. We know Labor is opposed to the development of small businesses. Our government absolutely supports the benefits that will accrue to the Australian economy, and particularly to small business, as a result of the free trade agreement with the United States.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gellibrand for her question. I will start by saying that any suggestion that the campaign has been cancelled or will not go ahead is completely wrong. It will go ahead. Insofar as I could quickly gather from the material that was read out, on its own and in isolation I find that material completely acceptable. But it was only part of an entire campaign.I am informed, for example, that one of the areas of concern included some commercials dealing with the depiction of a woman as a victim of rape. I am told that the call to action in the advertisement was to visit a web site for further information to understand exactly what sexual assault and relationship violence really were, rather than what I would have thought - and many on the committee thought - to be the rather commonsense injunction: that you might seek the assistance of the police, a doctor, your family, your friends, a minister, a priest or whoever. It was things of that nature which made the campaign in our view not fully conform with the government's objectives.I want to make it very clear to the House that there will be no reluctance in this campaign, when it comes out, to condemn the sort of mindless macho bullying violence depicted in the early part of the advertisement that was read. But it is palpably lacking in commonsense to put an advertisement that, as its first piece of advice, says to somebody who has been the victim of a violent rape to go to a web site. I am told - I have not seen the web site - that the web site was rather confusing. It is absolutely ridiculous. I would have thought that the first piece of advice you would give anybody who was the victim of that kind of unacceptable behaviour would be to go to the police, to go to a doctor or to go and talk to your parents or to your friends; not to visit a web site. It is that sort of inadequacy that I and the government quite unapologetically regard as inappropriate. That is why we are having the campaign recast - not in any way to pull back in relation to condemning domestic violence but, I hope, to give people in that deplorable situation rather more commonsense advice than to visit a web site.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question. Briefly overnight the Australian dollar went through the US80c mark, which is its highest value against the US dollar since December of 1996 and its highest level since the Asian financial crisis of 1997. In the last 18 months the Australia dollar has appreciated by 45 per cent against the US dollar and, perhaps even more significantly, by 31 per cent in trade weighted terms.There are a number of reasons that exchange rates might be affected but in this case one of the main ones is that the US dollar, which was very strong through 2000-01 and which rose, having the effect of pushing the Australian dollar down by comparison, has now softened. The US economy went into recession in 2001. The reasons why there was major capital inflow to the United States during that period have reversed. One of the major factors behind the rising of the Australian dollar against the US dollar is that the US dollar is much weaker than it was. The Australian economy continues strongly, and that also will have an effect in relation to exchange rates. With the world recovery coming, many of the items which Australia sells are stronger with stronger world demand.Having said all of that, the fact that the Australian exchange rate is much stronger than we were used to in 2001-02 does make life more difficult for our exporters. We acknowledge that. That is why it is very important that Australia helps its exporters. One of the major things that was done for the exports of Australia was the new tax system, which took all taxes off exports. Can you imagine where Australian exporters would be now if the old tax system were still in place?I also adverted yesterday to the fact that supply constraints have eased, particularly on agricultural produce. That means that we have more supply selling into a recovering world situation, which is also a good development notwithstanding the exchange rate moving against exporters. In passing, obviously, if we want to help our exporters in this difficult world market, getting new access for them into new markets is going to be a positive. If Australia is able to enter freer trading arrangements, which will help our exporters at a time when these exchange rates have moved against them, those who wish our exporters well will also be supporting those arrangements.The fact that the exchange rate has made life more difficult for our exporters will have an effect not only on them but also on the economy. It reminds us of the importance of keeping good economic policy going in this country. It reminds us of the fact that our economic policy must be disciplined and that we must work towards the goal of keeping our cost structures in Australia as low as possible so that our exporters can be as competitive as possible on world markets.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I could start at the end of it by assuring him that the final decision, after the 60-day consultation period that I now believe commences as a result of the release today, will be based on science and not on any ideology. We have absolutely no intention of replacing science with ideology in this particular area. We are very proud of the scientific basis of our quarantine approach and we do not intend to depart from that. My information is that some new evidence was presented, contrary to what is suggested in the honourable member's question. This issue has been around for a long time and I do understand the sensitivity of it. I also ask honourable members to understand the importance of preserving the integrity of our quarantine system, its reputation around the world, the respect we have for a science based quarantine system in Australia and the significance of it for our trading status in the world.I can assure the honourable member that I will take a very close interest in developments over the next 60 days. If people believe that there is a proper basis in science for reversing the recent decision of AQIS, I encourage them to bring it forward. I can assure the honourable gentleman and others that I will have it very carefully examined. I have no desire to disadvantage in any way the Australian industry, but we cannot in one breath say that we believe in a science based quarantine system and then, when it might suit us, ignore that criterion. If one has a scientific basis, bring it forward in the next 60 days and we will have a look at it. If one does not, in the interests of our reputation, we will have to uphold the integrity of our science based quarantine system.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macarthur for his question. I can inform him that the worldwide firm of KPMG has just published its 2004 competitive alternatives guide comparing business costs in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific. It found that in terms of competitive business costs the overall leader was Canada, followed very closely by Australia, both with business costs approximately eight or nine per cent below those of the United States. The United Kingdom ranked third, followed by Italy, France, Luxembourg, the United States, Iceland, the Netherlands, Germany and Japan. The survey found that, of all the 17 industries evaluated, Australia ranked first, second or third in terms of business costs. The area where Australia actually performed best, leading to its close second overall, was business tax. The KPMG survey found that overall the United Kingdom and Australia are the two countries that offer low effective income tax rates for the widest range of business operations. It found that Luxembourg, the UK, Australia and Canada are the countries with the lowest effective income tax rates. It found that for R&amp;D operations Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia had the most favourable tax treatment, and that for other non-manufacturing operations Iceland, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg and Australia offered the lowest effective income tax rates. That is a pretty good international benchmark for Australia in terms of business costs. Of course, the reason that we perform so well in the area of taxation for business costs is that Australia reduced its company tax rate to 30 per cent, we abolished the wholesale sales tax and took taxes off our exports, we abolished the financial institutions duty, we halved capital gains tax, we gave rollover relief on mergers and demergers, and we gave capital gains tax exemption to small business owners when they were either retiring or moving into a new business. That was the business tax agenda which was put in place by this government and was of course opposed hook, line and sinker by the Australian Labor Party.In a competitive world - and I spoke earlier about some of the competitive matters that are moving against us - if we want to retain our position at the forefront as a place for business investment, we must maintain our policy. We cannot afford to go back to a policy of more power for union officials and more regulated labour markets. We cannot afford to go back down the tariff path of the member for Werriwa. We cannot afford to go back down to the secondary boycott situation which the Labor Party supports, and we cannot afford to go back to the business tax imposts which the Labor Party is now talking about.Let me make this clear - and I think it is important: there is no job for an employee unless there is an employer who is able to create that job and there is no employer who can create a job unless that business is profitable. You will never create opportunity for young Australians to work unless you have a profitable business sector in this country. If you want to give those young Australians the right to work, it does not come from the hocus-pocus of the socialist left ideology that the member for Gellibrand consistently supports; it comes from consistent economic policy - consistent policy on budgets, on interest rates, on inflation, on corporate tax, on structural reform, on labour markets, on privatisation and on tariffs. These are the things that give Australians opportunity. You would not trust any of those things to the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question. I know how strongly he supports the MedicarePlus safety net legislation, because this new safety net fills an important structural gap in the existing Medicare system. Health services and their delivery have changed a great deal since 1984, when the Medicare system was first put in place. For instance, the rates at which people receive pathology and diagnostic imaging services have almost doubled since 1984, and these services have never been widely bulk-billed.Because doctors cannot and should not be forced to bulk-bill, many Australians face significant gap expenses. They face significant out-of-pocket medical expenses, and these people should not be left in the lurch any longer. The MedicarePlus safety net will benefit 200,000 Australians every year, and it will give all 20 million Australians the security that only a strong safety net can give. The latest figures show that nearly 2,800 Australian families had incurred gap expenses exceeding $500 in January alone. In just one month, 2,800 Australian families had incurred gap expenses exceeding $500. Every day, hundreds more Australians cross the MedicarePlus safety net threshold, and every week that the Labor Party blocks this legislation means that hundreds more Australians are significantly out-of-pocket.Before he became Australia's chief agony uncle, the member for Werriwa actually had some significant public policy things to say. For instance, he once said:This nation's egalitarian values should always be reflected in the maintenance of a compassionate and effective safety net for those who require public assistance.On another occasion he said:The methodology of good health reform is to get effective public safety net provisions in place ...These days he would prefer to talk about the crisis in masculinity. This government is addressing the crisis of affordability, which has now trapped too many Australians. The Leader of the Opposition now goes around the countryside saying to people, `I feel your pain.' It is high time that he stopped talking about it and started doing something about it, and the best place to start would be to pass the government's MedicarePlus safety net legislation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question and appreciate the interest he shows in this issue. I am sure he speaks very much for the people of the electorate of Blair when he expresses concern about illegal migration. It is important to note that the Dutch parliament this week did pass new legislation, with the support of a number of parties in the parliament, which will provide for the forcible return of illegal migrants to the Netherlands. And this is part of a trend: increasingly around the world governments are taking that sort of position, and that is entirely understandable. The Blair government has passed similar legislation; France, Sweden, Italy and Turkey are doing the same.This government have been tough on illegal immigration - there is no question about that - but we have been absolutely determined to cut out the evil trade of people-smuggling. The House will recall that some months ago a boat, the Minasa Bone, which was only the second unauthorised boat arrival since August 2001, arrived close to Australian shores. People smugglers were attempting to bring 14 Turkish nationals into Australia. As it turned out, none of the people on that boat were genuine refugees. Some of them chose to go straight back to Turkey after their boat was taken back to Indonesian waters and the people were landed in Indonesia. Around half of them, I think, went straight back to Turkey; the others were assessed by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees and found not to be refugees at all, and they have been repatriated to Turkey as well. In other words, what the government did was vindicated by that simple fact. A boatload of people, aided and abetted by people smugglers, tried to land in Australia. We ensured that boat was turned around. Those people went back whence they came - to Indonesia. Some fled back to Turkey; others were assessed by the UNHCR and found not to be refugees.At that time the Labor Party said that we should not have turned that boat around; we should have landed all those people in Australia - that was wrong. Of course, if we had, they would still be here, going through all the processes that we are familiar with, and they would be here for a long time. And if they were here the people smugglers would have had a very substantial victory. The people smugglers would have been able to say to other prospective clients, `We've just landed that boatload of 14 people from the Minasa Bone; they weren't refugees, of course; they just paid some money. We managed to get them landed. We can do the same for you.' If we had followed a policy of allowing those people to land we would have just given the green light to people smugglers.Are there any alternative approaches? Yes, there is the Labor Party's alternative approach, which is to allow boats with illegal migrants on them to land in Australia, not to turn those boats back. So on the one hand the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party say they would like to have a coastguard, which as far as I can make out involves three motorboats for 36,000 kilometres of coastline. They would like to have a coastguard, but what would the coastguard actually do? When a boat comes and the coastguard intercept the boat, all the coastguard will do is guide the boat to the Australian mainland. It defies commonsense. The policy of the opposition is a policy to reopen people-smuggling and to encourage people-smuggling, not to cut it off. This government have been extraordinarily successful in cutting off people-smuggling, and it is a lesson to those who oppose the government's policy that other countries around the world are now increasingly taking a more robust approach to this problem, whereas our own Labor Party at the federal level in Australia want to weaken the policy and play into the hands of the people smugglers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for the question. There are a number of important issues in it. First I should correct the question - which misrepresented what I said. I said that if the reason that has allegedly been put forward by the Queensland University of Technology - that it would seek possibly to increase HECS charges by up to 25 per cent in order to equate to a university of prestige - is the reason that they are choosing to increase HECS, that is outrageous. To Australian university councils sitting around this year thinking about what their courses are actually worth and what students are actually going to get for the HECS charges - that will be levied from zero to a level no more than 25 per cent above what they currently are - I say this: think very carefully in terms of explaining to Australian students whether they will as a result of this be employing more staff, providing more opportunities and lecture theatres and providing scholarships for low-income students.There is a second issue in the question. Let me get this absolutely right: the member for Jagajaga is describing a possible 25 per cent increase in HECS for university students, which they would pay back once they had graduated from university and were earning more than $35,000 a year, as outrageous. Am I right in saying that? - In fact, in the question, the member for Jagajaga described it as outrageous. I say to the Australian Labor Party that the first thing that it needs -  - The Australian taxpayer is about to invest an extra $11 billion in the next 10 years in Australian higher education - $2.6 billion extra in the next five years. It needs to be remembered that university graduates earn on average $8,000 a year more than a person who has not been to university, have a lifetime unemployment rate which is a quarter of that of a person who has not been to university and 92 per cent of them have full employment within four months of graduation. It also ought to be remembered that male university graduates earn more than $600,000 more than a person who has not been to university and that the Australian taxpayers - the chippies, the boilermakers, the welders, the plumbers and many Australians who have never seen the inside of a university but who strongly support what happens inside them - will continue to pay for three-quarters of what happens inside them.It would be quite clear to any clear minded person here today listening to the question that the member for Jagajaga and the Labor Party believe that a 25 per cent increase in HECS is outrageous. - When the Labor Party has something to say about the 300 per cent compulsory up-front charge in TAFE fees levied by the New South Wales Carr Labor government -  - and the full fee paying degrees introduced into Victorian TAFE by the Bracks government last year, or the 25 per cent compulsory up-front TAFE fees introduced into Victoria at the same time, or the 50 per cent increase in up-front TAFE fees in South Australia - where some of the poorest people in the country are fronting up to TAFE and cannot even get in the door until they have paid their fees - then we might start listening to your concerns about people training to be doctors and lawyers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fairfax for his question. I know how concerned he is about the Centenary House racket. - I can inform the member for Fairfax that this morning the man who has no past, sitting opposite me, has finally acknowledged that some things did happen before 2 December last year with the coming of the ghost of Gough Whitlam. This morning the Leader of the Opposition said that the Centenary House rent and Canberra market rent are out of alignment because `the Howard government gutted the Public Service in 1996.' So the $36 million windfall to the Labor Party is somehow the Prime Minister's fault! For the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, let me explain that in 1993 the Centenary House rent was 11 per cent above market value, in 1994 the Centenary House rent was 19 per cent above market value and in 1995 the Centenary House rent was 29 per cent above market value. It was already 29 per cent above market value under Paul Keating. Now it is 177 per cent above market value, and in September when the escalation clause kicks in it will be 202 per cent above market value.This rip-off, this rolled gold rip-off which the Leader of the Opposition will not fix, did not occur then; it is occurring now. It is a rip-off now. Thanks to the Centenary House extortion racket, the Leader of the Opposition has already trousered half a million dollars towards his election campaign. By 30 June this year he will have lined his pockets with nearly $1 million. By the end of the lease, in four years time, it will have been worth $14 million, which will have been used for the electoral purposes of the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition does not need superannuation; he has Centenary House.When asked about it this morning, the Leader of the Opposition said, `Yeah, but it's a legal agreement.' On Tuesday he said that we needed more ethical standards and new ethical standards in politics, and on Thursday he says that anything goes, provided it is legal. We do not expect the Leader of the Opposition to practise what he preached last year, but we would like him to practise what he preaches this week. The Leader of the Opposition now wants to talk about masculinity. Let me say this to the Leader of the Opposition: real men are not hypocrites, and if he were a real man he would end the Centenary House rip-off now.</DOC>

 - In answer to the member for Melbourne, as I was not present at the Telstra board meeting - nor have I been briefed, nor have I sought a briefing, on the proceedings of that board - I am not in a position to express a view as to whether or not what Mr Mansfield said on radio yesterday was correct. I do not have any independent knowledge of those matters. I am in a position to speak of the discussion that I had with Mr Mansfield, and I indicated that Mr Mansfield had raised this matter with me. He raised, in terms of what I described yesterday, the possibility of a deal going forward to the board involving Sensis, Fairfax and Telstra. - I retain full confidence in Mr Mansfield - yes, I do. While I am on my feet, and because the member for Melbourne has asked me a question about Telstra, I might make a couple of other observations that I think are relevant to this debate. I remind the House that it was in 1991 that legislation was passed through this parliament, at the instance of the Hawke government, requiring that Telstra - listen to this - act independently and commercially. That legislation was passed with our support.I also remind the House that there are 1.8 million Australians who are shareholders in Telstra - 1.8 million Australians. What the Labor Party's policy has enunciated is that the member for Melbourne and the Leader of the Opposition will systematically destroy the value of that shareholding of those 1.8 million Australians. If Telstra is required to act independently and commercially, therefore the directors of that company have an obligation to pay regard to the interests of minority shareholders. As the major shareholder in Telstra, this government has an obligation under company law and as a matter of fair treatment to have regard to the interests of minority shareholders. That is the reason why, despite the cheap populism of the opposition on this issue, I took the view - and the Treasurer agreed with me completely on that issue - that in no circumstances should we seek to intervene in a commercial decision of the board of Telstra.The shadow minister - the man who asked me the question - has made it very clear that a Labor government would be `a more hands-on shareholder'. Pity help the 1.8 million Australians if the shadow minister exercises his hands-on policy. He wants Telstra, amongst other things, to divest its 50 per cent share of Foxtel. He has warned Telstra to back off from media deals. He wants Telstra's ability to rebalance line rental charges to be removed, and analysts have suggested that this could wipe about $500 million from the company's revenue over the next two years.At the same time that the shadow minister is systematically giving an indication of trashing the value of the company by heavy-handed intervention, the shadow minister for finance, the member for Fraser, is carrying on about how a future Labor government might get increased revenue from Telstra. In other words, you destroy the value of the company, you prevent it from investing in anything decent, you rubbish the minority shareholders, but all the time the company will bloom. They have obviously discovered a third way - a magic pudding - that has eluded all of us and their predecessors on that side of the House for a very long time.</DOC>

 - I can assure and reassure the member for Dobell and all in the House that the Howard government is entirely committed to mutual obligation because of the good things it does for the economy and for individuals. Of course, a very important plank of that is the Work for the Dole program. To date there have been some 40,000 years of labour, of work experience, conducted by personnel around Australia that have participated in Work for the Dole. That is 40,000 man years of worthwhile projects.As the member for Dobell would be aware, there are such projects as the Central Coast environmental care and monitoring project, which was completed last year. That is a project which built on the community's need for personnel to get work experience. It actually improved the environment and, most importantly, it ended up with three out of those eight participants, I believe, getting full-time work whilst they were undertaking the project. So there has been an equivalent of 40,000 man years of work experience, 15,000 community projects and some quarter of a million participants.I am asked: is there any alternative policy in this area? Is there anything that is going to put at risk this program to Australia? In 2000, under their previous leader, the Labor platform made it very clear that they were going to retain Work for the Dole. I have to say that those on this side of the House were somewhat sceptical of that, but it was at least there in the platform. As we speak, in the Australian Labor Party's draft platform as presented to the 43rd national conference - about 22 pages of words; not much substance but 22 pages of words - there is not one mention of Work for the Dole. It has been cut. It is gone; it is just not there. Under the member for Brand's leadership, at least Work for the Dole was part of the platform, but under the member for Werriwa it is not part of the platform.We ask: is it in or is it out? Can we rely on these worthwhile community projects continuing? The member for Werriwa, in 1997, had this to say:... the battlers around Australia want something more than a defeatist work for the dole scheme.That would explain why it is no longer there. He was actually in agreeance for once with the member for Grayndler, who also said that Work for the Dole schemes are only designed to punish the unemployed. That was a rare occurrence when those two were in sync with each other. By 2001 the member for Werriwa had started to change his position. He said:... unemployed people have a responsibility to work for the dole.We have seen many changes in his attitude to many subjects, and one of those is of course Centenary House. Latham's Labor platform says that there is not going to be any Work for the Dole. That is a statement of fact - it is not there. But previous comments give a confusing picture. We have the member for Grayndler being absolutely opposed and we have the member for Franklin being willing to support it and to put projects up for Work for the Dole programs - and I congratulate him for that.So where does Labor stand on this important issue? I challenge the member for Werriwa to come out and articulate a clear policy position on something, anything - in particular, why not just on Work for the Dole? Having done so, I would then challenge him to stick to that position for more than one day and to bring his backbench, let alone his frontbench, with him. If he can do that, it will be a first for the time he has been Leader of the Opposition. This side of the House is 100 per cent committed to mutual obligation. What remains to been seen is what Labor, the member for Werriwa and the member for Grayndler are going to do. We await your next utterance on this, as we do with so many other subjects.</DOC>

 - The simple answer to that is no. But clearly the member for Grayndler did mislead that conference when he said that there would be no public provider and now in your platform you say there are. I can also tell you that the government is committed to spending $2.77 billion over three years with the Job Network to get people into work. What seems to be concerning those on the other side is that Job Network is working. Unemployment is coming down; there is a record number of Australians in work; we are giving them an opportunity; and the Job Network, unlike the CES, is in fact an effective tool for driving down unemployment and getting Australians back into jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Farrer for her question and acknowledge her experience as a small business person and the fact that she is an indefatigable advocate for small businesses in her electorate. As almost every member of this House would be aware, high insurance premiums have had a real impact over the last few years on not just 1.1 million small businesses but also community service clubs, importantly, sporting clubs, and a range of other service providers. There is no doubt that one of the most significant contributors to that has been very high state taxes on insurance. In regional Victoria up to 70 per cent of an insurance premium goes in tax to the Bracks government, which is outrageous. - So there was a great expression of relief from many small businesses and community groups when the states and the Commonwealth made an agreement in 2002 to reform the laws of negligence so that the plaintiff lawyers could not exploit loopholes in the law. Those law reforms were very important because they helped to reduce the cost of insurance. The states did their job and put legislation to reform the laws of negligence into their parliaments and passed the laws. To fulfil its part of the bargain, the federal government put legislation into the parliament, but it was voted down by the Labor Party last week. So the Labor Party voted down any attempt by the federal government to reduce the costs of insurance for sporting clubs, community groups and small businesses.I have been searching for support, and I came across a letter; a letter came into my possession. The letter is from someone who is a strong advocate of law reform - particularly by the federal government. The letter is from someone who is close to the Labor Party - very close to the Labor Party. In fact, he is a member of the Labor Party. The letter is from none other than the federal member for Lyons, who was interjecting a moment ago. The letter to my colleague goes like this:A number of constituents have been approaching me about the difficulties the public liability insurance is causing within communities.We agree. The letter goes on:Although some schemes have been set up to alleviate the situation, without some overall changes to legislation and some national direction set for insurance, I feel the imposts on small communities is almost unbearable. Already I have a number of voluntary organisations fold because of inability to find cover for their events, and there are still more that may follow.The member for Lyons goes on to say:I believe this is something that should be above politics and should be dealt with in order to find insurance that covers community activities before all community organisations are forced to disband.I would be grateful if this could be made a priority ...Mr Speaker, the member for Lyons is absolutely right. The only problem is that he has a communications problem with the member for Werriwa, because last week the Labor Party voted down that national legislation. Last week, the Labor Party put the interests of the plaintive lawyers ahead of the interests of 1.1 million small businesses and of community groups and sporting clubs, who are totally saddled with the burden of insurance - they either cannot get insurance or cannot afford it. If the Labor Party does not want to live in the hypocritical daze that it seems to be occupied with at the moment, there is one simple solution: vote in the national interest. Put the interests of the community ahead of the interests of the Labor Party and put the interests of small business ahead of the interests of the plaintive lawyers.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The committee report that was tabled today was compiled by a cross-party group of senators and members - including the two most credible people on intelligence in the Labor Party, the member for Brand and Senator Ray, both former defence ministers - and said a number of things, but the most powerful was that it completely denied the 12-month claim of the Labor Party that we went to war based on a lie. That is the most important thing that the committee has done. The committee found there was no interference in the work of the intelligence agencies. The committee found that the statements that I and my colleagues had made were very moderate, particularly compared with statements made elsewhere. Indeed, as I read through the report, it is a litany of repudiation of the exaggerated claims made by the Leader of the Opposition and his predecessor over recent months.As to the question of an inquiry, I have already announced that the government will accept the recommendations of the committee, precisely as recommended by the committee. We will do exactly what the member for Brand and Senator Ray recommended. I think on this occasion we ought to take notice of what the member for Brand says. He has a lot more credibility than anybody on the front bench when it comes to intelligence matters. We will have an inquiry in the terms recommended by the bipartisan committee. As to the terms of reference and the timing, I will announce those very shortly. Self-evidently, I was not in a position to initiate any discussions with anybody about constituting the inquiry until the report had been tabled. Naturally, I have to consult the person who is going to constitute the inquiry about its duration and its terms of reference. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition: we will follow what was recommended by the committee. We will follow the advice to have a former intelligence expert constitute the inquiry, and I can assure the House the terms of reference will broadly reflect what was recommended by the committee.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the member for Wannon for his question and for the interest he has shown in the parliamentary joint committee report that was chaired by the member for Fadden and, as the Prime Minister said, included members of both the government and the opposition. There is no doubt that this report vindicates the government's use of intelligence in making the case for action against Iraq. This report confirms there is `no evidence that political pressure was applied to the agencies' - that is a quote from the report - and there was `no overt pressure from the government to change assessments'. There would be no point in the government applying overt or covert pressure to get intelligence agencies to change assessments. The government just would not do that.The report also shows that the government's presentation of the case for war was consistent, moderate and measured. It has been demonstrated once more through this report, as it has been through other reports that have been produced, that the government did not sex up intelligence or sex up the story about Iraq in order to justify the overthrow of the regime of Saddam Hussein. The government cooperated fully with the inquiry. We facilitated evidence by ONA and DIO, and neither of those organisations was covered formally by the committee's terms of reference. And, as the Prime Minister said, we accept the recommendations.But, to follow on from the honourable member's question, this government is in no doubt: we were right to join coalition action against the regime of Saddam Hussein and to overthrow that regime. Prewar intelligence assessments of Saddam's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and his concealment efforts have been borne out by the Iraq Survey Group's findings. Since the war, dozens of weapons of mass destruction activities have been located, as was made clear by Dr Kay in his statement on 2 October.An opposition member - What a joke! - An opposition member says it is a joke - that Dr Kay is a joke. Dr Kay is not a joke; Dr Kay was the head of the Iraq Survey Group. We will come back to where the jokes are here a little bit later. Dozens of weapons of mass destruction activities have been found by Dr Kay and the Iraq Survey Group. Dr Kay is in no doubt that Iraq was in `clear violation of UN Security Council resolution 1441'. Dr Kay also said `that Iraq was a more dangerous place than we thought before the war'. Before the war everybody thought Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Everybody thought that, including the United Nations. - `Not everybody,' says the opposition. I am afraid that is not true. The member for Griffith, for example, on 13 March last year - and honourable members will be interested in this - said:We have said from the beginning that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction. Let's have an honest debate about this. The key question is what do we do about it and how, and whether what we do about it is consistent with international law. That's the debate here.Exactly. That was the debate. The fact is that Iraq has been found to have had weapons of mass destruction programs. Whether there are stockpiles or not remains to be seen. But the opposition held that view before the war, the government held that view before the war, the United Nations held that view before the war and the international community held that view before the war. There are similarities and differences between the government's and the opposition's position on this. The government and the opposition both believed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and weapons of mass destruction programs. The government decided that the best way of dealing with that was to overthrow Saddam Hussein and oust his barbarous regime. The opposition thought he should remain in power.</DOC>

 - I have indicated in the past that action taken collectively by nations and not necessarily flowing from a resolution of the United Nations can be justified. I do not resile from that. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that the action taken by the NATO countries in relation to Serbia to liberate the Muslims of Kosovo was not carried out pursuant to a United Nations resolution. I do not recall the Australian Labor Party opposing that. I think nations are entitled to take action to protect their interests. I have indicated in the past that I do not see any circumstances, as currently advised to me, where this nation would need to take pre-emptive action.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I am sure all members of the House will be aware that last week the government released a paper on Australia's demographic challenges which set out the nature of the demographic challenge which Australia will be facing over the next 30 to 40 years. That has largely been set by the birthrates of the last 30 years and by the advances in medical science. We will have an ageing demographic in our population. In 40 years time something like 25 per cent of Australians will be aged 65 or over. Today there are five people of workplace age to support every person of retirement age. In 40 years time there are going to be 2½ people to support every Australian of retirement age. What that means is that the people in the work force are going to have a call on them for greater taxes or fewer services unless we can grow the Australian economy faster and better, and unless we start making provision now. - My message at the moment to the people of Australia is this: we know these demographic changes are occurring. Either we will take small steps early to adjust to them or, if we leave it too late, we will be forced into much more drastic steps in the years to come. In laying down these changes, we want to engage the whole Australian community in a discussion about the most significant demographic change that is coming in Australia. We want to put these issues out openly and honestly before the Australian public so that they too can contribute to the positive measures which are required to adjust to them. We announced some positive measures as part of the statement during the week, such as making it possible for those who stay in the work force to access superannuation so that they can engage in part-time work and draw on superannuation at the same time. - We announced measures like allowing market linked pensions, which will be a new product, to give people the opportunity to have a growth income stream in their retirement. In addition to that, we want to also emphasise the importance of reforming some of Australia's income support payments. At the moment in Australia there are 2.7 million Australians who are on income support payments of one kind or another, and only one in six of those payments has a requirement for some kind of participation or work. That is why this government have reforms to the disability support pension that are now stalled in the Senate. We call on the opposition to pass those measures. The Labor Party has supported the reform of the disability support pension in words but not in action. If the member for Werriwa wants to show that he is interested in action rather than words, he could perhaps back up the statement that he made on 26 July 1999 as the shadow minister for economic ownership. The member for Werriwa, now the Leader of the Opposition, said this -  - He said that it didn't count because he was on the backbench. Let me remind him of his words. This is what the brave member for Werriwa had to say on the disability support pension. He said:Something also needs to be done about the outrageous growth in the Disability Support Pension (DSP), which is now paid to more than 550,000 Australians ... Some experts believe the size of the program should be no more than 150,000.... The DSP needs to be overhauled and mutual responsibility policies applied to all those with a genuine capacity for work.To which we say, `Hear, hear.' They were brave words then, but the member for Werriwa cannot match them with action now. We call on the Leader of the Opposition: `Live up to the words. Turn your face against the obstructionist policies of the member for Hotham, your predecessor. Live up to what you knew was right in 1999. Let us reach out to Australia and reform this together, and let us confront the democratic challenge in a way which will give all a better opportunity.'</DOC>

 - The member for Griffith is asking me to say whether I agree or disagree with the expression of an opinion by the Defence Intelligence Organisation. The Defence Intelligence Organisation is entitled to express its opinion. The role of government, having received intelligence, is to make a political judgment as to what ought to occur. We made a judgment based on the intelligence but exercising our judgment, as the government of the day, that the right thing to do in the long-term interests of this country was to join the coalition of the willing. I think the member for Griffith has to understand that there is a difference in our system of government between the intelligence assessments that are made based on material collected from either human or signals intelligence sources and the political conclusions that are drawn as to the necessary action to be taken once that material has been received.I remind the member for Griffith that the great debate 13 months ago was not what he questioned me on a moment ago but what to do about the weapons of mass destruction that everybody agreed Iraq possessed. I remind the leader - I am sorry, the member for Griffith - A government member - He could have been leader! - Now come on, don't be unkind! I remind him of something that he said on the Lateline program - a favourite program of the current Labor Party opposition frontbench - on 24 September 2002. He said:I say on behalf of the party that we welcome this new information.There is no debate or dispute as to whether Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction.He does.They were his words. He went on:There's no dispute as whether he's in violation of UN Security Council resolutions.He is. - So, as far back as September 2002 - four, five or perhaps six months before the decision was taken to join the coalition of the willing - there was no debate as far as the opposition were concerned. They all agreed that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. Basically, what the member for Griffith wanted us to do was to follow a course of action that would have left Saddam Hussein in power. That has always been the difference between the approach taken by the government and the approach taken by the member for Griffith, by the former Leader of the Opposition and, indeed, by the current Leader of the Opposition.The member for Griffith cannot avoid the irrefutable conclusion of the committee report that was tabled today. It must be an intense disappointment to him to realise that a committee that includes the two really credible figures on intelligence in the Australian Labor Party - the member for Brand and Senator Ray - has in fact disputed the central proposition of the Labor Party over the last year: that in some way we sexed up the intelligence and in some way we lent on the intelligence agencies. We did not do anything of the kind. As the report correctly records:The government's emphatic claim about the existence of Iraqi WMD reflected the views of the Office of National Assessments after 13 September 2002.It might well have added that it also reflected the emphatic views of the member for Griffith on 24 September 2002, because you know, and we know that you know, that way back then you were not arguing about possession of WMD; you were arguing -  - as to whether you should go along with the French, the Russians and those who were prepared to string it out and ultimately follow a course of action that would have left Saddam Hussein in power. At least I can say otherwise of others who sit opposite, including the member for Brand, who on 31 July last year addressing the John Turner Memorial History Lecture in Newcastle - it was titled National Security: Where Are We Now? - said, inter alia:I don't have the time to analyse the war in Iraq and its aftermath. Several points are worth making. On the positive side, a brutal dictator has been removed from power. The willingness of the United States to use force has concentrated the minds of neighbouring countries. They are now more diligent in dealing with al-Qaeda and al-Qaeda type operations within their borders.I acknowledge that the member for Brand may have said some other things on that occasion as well, but those remarks are very pertinent. - I will just add one thing. I think it might also be said that as well as concentrating the minds of neighbouring countries, if I can borrow the expression of the member for Brand and more specifically adopt that language, the mind of one neighbouring country that I believe was concentrated was the mind of Libya. I think there is a very powerful argument that the action taken by the coalition was a very material factor in inducing Libya to give up her weapons of mass destruction.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question and for standing up sincerely for choice and opportunity in education - in particular, for St Cecilia's Catholic School at Wyong. Yesterday, the Prime Minister and His Eminence Cardinal George Pell jointly announced a very important breakthrough for Catholic education in this country. Twelve and a half billion dollars of additional money will be provided to Catholic education over the next four years, beginning in 2005, and, importantly, $362 million of real increase in funding to Catholic schools will be delivered for those 607,000 students in Catholic systemic schools throughout Australia.The announcement also heralds a strengthening of the integrity of the socioeconomic status funding formula, which has been used by the government for almost four years now to provide resources for non-government schools. His Eminence Cardinal George Pell made a significant statement yesterday, and I will quote it in part. He said:The bulk of government funding for Catholic schools comes from the Federal government, although state governments also make a significant contribution. For government schools the opposite is the case, with the bulk of funding coming from state governments. Recognising the importance of parental choice in education means that we all need to work for the best possible government and non-government schools, all well-resourced, especially in areas which are socially and economically disadvantaged.The fact is that in this country 68 per cent of Australia's schoolchildren receive some 76 per cent of all of the public funding. In contrast, the 32 per cent of Australian students who attend Catholic and independent schools receive 24 per cent of all the public funding. So you have 2.2 million students in state schools who receive $20 billion and almost 1.1 million in Catholic and independent schools who receive not $10 billion but $6.2 billion. It is parents, through hard work and sacrifices for their children, who pay almost $4 billion in school fees to provide the education they think is best for them.I am asked about alternative policies. It is a bit like Possum Magic - they are a bit hard to find. On 2 February I opened the Australian newspaper and found on the front page `Labor plan for needy schools'. Referring to the Leader of the Opposition, the story said that his vision `is to integrate for the first time the two separate funding streams, where the Commonwealth now largely funds non-government schools, and the states fund the government schools'. On the same day the shadow minister for finance, who no doubt was working diligently on this plan and seeing that it was well costed, said on Sky News:Well, I think Australians would welcome that. They are sick of the argy-bargy of everyone blaming everybody else. What you need is a Federal Government with the capacity to agree with the State Governments about a pooling arrangement for funding.So obviously we had a well-developed policy, one can only assume, but then the following day, on 3 February, I opened the Sydney Morning Herald. It said:Labor's Education spokeswoman, Jenny Macklin, yesterday denied reports that a Labor government would collapse all federal and state funding for schools into one pool ...So here we have the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for finance beavering away on this so-called new plan and, in the same building, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the education spokeswoman is denying it is even happening. In fact, the Sydney Morning Herald went on to say:Federal funding for public schools would continue to be channelled through state governments.I thought, goodness knows - as a parent, apart from anything else - where is all this going? And then a week later in the Canberra Times I read this, from Andrew Fraser:Latham, they contend, is pushing for the collapsing of federal and state funding into a central pool, a position Macklin denies repeatedly. Latham does too, outright.So of course I thought: `Who wrote the original story? Was this a cadet journalist? Was this somebody who misinterpreted what the Leader of the Opposition said?' I went back and I had a look: Paul Kelly, Editor-at-large. Obviously, the Leader of the Opposition must have been misreported! The fact is that it is all very well for the Labor Party to base policy on the latest neuronal synapse that has gone through the head of the Leader of the Opposition, but the families of this country are budgeting for almost 12 years of Catholic schooling, of independent schooling, and are struggling with their mortgages, their car loans and their financial commitments. It is bad enough that you trifle with their emotions, let alone their finances. These families need certainty and they need security. The Labor Party needs to support not only choice but also opportunity - and families will have the opportunity to vote for that very soon.</DOC>

 - Perhaps I could quietly explain to the member for Griffith the way the system works. I thought he might have known it, but it is the role of the Office of National Assessments, as its title suggests, to make assessments. In all the work it carries out, it has ongoing contact with the agencies. The practice I adopted of clearing the material that I presented to parliament is a practice fully consistent with the arrangements. It seems to me that what the member for Griffith is suggesting is that in some way political government abdicates its role entirely in making decisions for which it is politically accountable. The role of agencies is to gather raw intelligence data in cooperation with partner agencies in other countries. The role of the Office of National Assessments is to assess that material and deliver those assessments to the government. I can only repeat the finding of the bipartisan committee that the government's emphatic claim about the existence of Iraqi WMD reflected the views of the Office of National Assessments after 13 September 2002.But it continues to intrigue me that the member for Griffith of all people should light upon the stiffening and the strengthening of the views of the Office of National Assessments after about September 2002. The ONA was a country mile behind the member for Griffith in expressing a robust view about the possession of WMD. There is one thing you have got to say about the member for Griffith: if you can understate something, he never does. He has on occasions a quite endearing capacity to state something without any qualification. And on this occasion I do find it an endearing quality, because what he had to say - and I repeat it for the benefit of the parliament - on 24 September was:There is no debate or dispute ...He did not entertain any scepticism - not for the member for Griffith any of this faint-hearted scepticism - none of that. He said:There is no debate or dispute as to whether Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction.He does.There's no dispute as to whether he's in violation of UN Security Council resolutions.He is.They are not the words of DIO. They are not the words of ONA. They are the words of the member for Griffith. And who am I to argue with the member for Griffith?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note his real interest in the security of the region. Our Asia-Pacific neighbours are strengthening their transport security regimes in order to meet increasingly tight, but I think very desirable, international standards. But it is the case that some of them need support in meeting those standards. To that end I would like the House to be aware that Australia has taken, and will continue to take, quite a wide leadership role in assisting other countries in their endeavours - it has to be said, perhaps self-evidently - for their sakes as well as for our own.For example, we are working very closely with the Papua New Guinean government on key security challenges. This package includes the placement of Australian transport security experts into the PNG bureaucracy and a senior official into the PNG civil aviation authority later this year. Shortly a couple of my officers will travel to Papua New Guinea to provide immediate assistance in relation to shipping and the international shipping convention security arrangements. These measures are designed to aid Papua New Guinea in improving its ability to tackle transport security and safety issues. I am pleased with the development of the cooperative relationship thus far.In addition to that, we have successfully delivered maritime security workshops in the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. These have been in recognition in part of Australia's expertise in these areas, but they have helped very considerably each country move towards compliance with the international maritime standards, which are due to come into force on 1 July this year. We will be providing a second round of workshops and additional technical assistance in the Philippines as part of the $5 million Philippines counterterrorism assistance package. We are working too with Indonesia to enhance their aviation capacities as part of the $10 million four-year counterterrorism initiative. We will also be placing transport security officers in embassies in Jakarta and Manila as part of our regional approach, and we will continue to take seriously further requests for our assistance. Our security at home will of course be enhanced by these actions, just as will the security of the affected nations. I think Australia is playing an important leadership role and will continue to do so.</DOC>

 - I want to make a couple of points about that. The first is that -  - You don't want me to answer it at all, do you? I want to make a couple of points. The first is that the committee not just looked at the intelligence provided by the Australian intelligence community but also referred to the fact that the government on a number of occasions quoted other sources. One set of sources we quoted were British and American documents - publicly available documents. For example, we quoted extensively from the September dossier of the Blair government. We also quoted the 1999 final report of UNSCOM, the United Nations Special Commission. The UNSCOM report had a long inventory of weapons of mass destruction materials which Iraq had not accounted for. We quoted this on many occasions, and so did other people. So it was the combination of the quotations from the British and American documents, the quotation from UNSCOM - which of course was headed by none other than the Governor of Tasmania, His Excellency Mr Richard Butler - and we quoted from our intelligence sources and other sources beyond that.It is perfectly clear from the conclusions of the committee report, a bipartisan committee, that the government did not sex up the intelligence or sex up the story about Iraq. Insofar as the opposition claims that the government had done any sexing up, it has to be said that the opposition was doing an awful lot of sexing up as well, saying that Iraq had -  -  - No, I did not use the Prime Minister's quote from Lateline; I used the one from SBS Insightto give the public broadcasters a bit of even coverage. I repeat what the member for Griffith said on 13 March - and remember that 13 March was just before the war started. He said, `We have said from the beginning that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction.' The member for Griffith and the opposition were not free from the briefings by the intelligence agencies. They had briefings on three or four occasions by our intelligence agencies, particularly by the Office of National Assessments. So they cannot come into this House and claim that the Office of National Assessments or somebody else had been telling them Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction. They themselves were saying that Iraq did have weapons of mass destruction without of course being subject to the charge of sexing up. If ever there was a person in this parliament who did a lot of sexing up, it was the member for Griffith.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. What an excellent neighbour he is as a member of the House of Representatives. - Yes; I am confident that that is true. - I think he does. I think you are right about that. The Prime Minister and I met this morning with the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Sir Allan Kemakeza. Obviously, the discussion focused predominantly on the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands, RAMSI. I do not think this House would be surprised to hear that Sir Allan expressed very strong appreciation for the significant help Australia is providing to overcome the problems of the Solomon Islands. He thanked the Australian government for the leadership it has shown in helping to restore law and order and some semblance of an economy in his country.We have been working very successfully through RAMSI with the Solomon Islands government. Law and order across the Solomon Islands has been restored. Over 3,700 weapons have been collected, and ordinary Solomon Islanders are able to go about their lives, free from violence and intimidation. The police have arrested 940 people, and in some cases lengthy jail terms have been handed down. Jail terms have been handed down to an ex-minister and senior Royal Solomon Islands Police Force members, as well as members of the broader Solomon Islands community. As I said to Sir Allan this morning, this has sent a very strong message to the community about the need for law and order and of course, very importantly, to ensure that the practice of corruption, which has been fairly common in the Solomon Islands over the years, comes to an end.These are modest beginnings; there is a long way to go in the Solomon Islands. But I think the government and, more broadly, the Australian Federal Police, the officers of a number of departments - the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and AusAID - and, importantly, members of the Australian Defence Force can be very proud of the role they have played in cooperation with regional governments in restoring the Solomon Islands to the level of stability that it has now achieved. We have a long way to go; there is much more to be done, and it is going to take a good deal of time. But it is all part of a pattern of what the government is doing in the Pacific to try to strengthen the countries of the Pacific: RAMSI, the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands; the enhanced cooperation program in Papua New Guinea; and the work we are doing in countries like Samoa, Fiji and Tonga to help those countries achieve a more stable and fruitful future. I think all Australians can be very proud of what we are doing.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and confirm that when I can be of assistance in terms of regional development I usually will seek to do so. But the issues that he raises are so overwhelmingly of a state nature in their responsibility that I am reluctant -  -  - I know that if those opposite had their way we would have a government taxpayer-funded solution to every single conceivable problem that mankind is capable of devising. But, for better or for worse, we have in this country a federal system under which there must still be some things for which state governments are to be held responsible - just some things. I am beginning to wonder what they might be, but there must be some. I would suggest that the entirely legitimate objectives of the member who asked the question squarely belong in the domain of being, surely, just one of those things that the state government is responsible for.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. The member for Maranoa knows that the free trade agreement that we have negotiated with the United States will unquestionably benefit a lot of the industries in his electorate, as will any negotiated outcome we achieve with China. The beef, grains, coal, cotton and wool industries in his electorate will all benefit from greater liberalisation of the markets of the world. In answer to the specifics of the question, we expect that hopefully tomorrow we will be able to release publicly the full text of the FTA. There are some 900 pages that have been worked through by our officials and the officials of the US government in Washington. Accompanying that, we will release a user guide so that people can navigate their way through the legal text, particularly to assist some of those members opposite to find their way through some of the legalese in the agreement. I can also inform the House that the government proposes to call tenders for some economic analysis to be done of the agreement as it is structured. Members would recall that we did have some modelling done prior to the negotiation of the agreement. It was done on a hypothetical basis, and we will now be able to have modelling undertaken on the actual outcome of the negotiations.With regard to the second part of the member's question, I have noticed on a number of occasions in recent months criticism of the government's position in pursuing a free trade agreement with America, using as the basis or reason for that criticism the fact that it will impact upon our relationships in Asia. There is nothing further from the truth. They have been proven to be wrong. Our relationships in East Asia have not been affected by our negotiations with the United States, and the successful conclusion of this agreement will not affect those relationships. I instance some of the undertakings we have been involved in in recent times: the conclusion of free trade agreements with Singapore and Thailand and the just concluded negotiations with the United States; and we are now actively engaged in discussions and a scoping study for a free trade agreement with China. The Chinese government is certainly very keen to move that process along as quickly as possible.During the time that we have been negotiating with the United States there have been some significant announcements. We had the $25 billion gas deal from the North West Shelf and, today, BHP Billiton have announced a joint venture to supply $11.7 billion worth of iron ore over 25 years from Jimblebar mine at Mount Newman in Western Australia to steel companies in four different provinces in China. I know that the member for Kalgoorlie will be quite excited about this outcome for his electorate and the jobs that that will mean. That is a deal that has been done with China.In answer to the member for Maranoa's question, the free trade agreement is obviously having a positive impact. These deals demonstrate the confidence that Chinese businesses have in going into partnership arrangements over a longer period of time with Australian exporters. They obviously have confidence in the Australian government and the way we are managing not only the economy in Australia but also the relationship between us and China. Our government is always looking for new opportunities to assist business both at home and abroad - unlike the Labor Party, who are always looking for reasons to get in their way.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. The fact sheet which has been distributed by the government and by my department is just that: a fact sheet. This fact sheet responds to a dishonest campaign which is being run by the Australian Education Union and supported by the Australian Labor Party and at least a dirty dozen on the Labor backbench who do not want a single dollar to go to Catholic schools, let alone the $12½ billion that will be delivered in the next four years. As His Eminence Cardinal George Pell pointed out yesterday, the majority of funding in this country for schools goes to state government schools. The reality is that 68 per cent of the students in the school system in this country are in state schools and they receive 76 per cent of all the public funding. As I said earlier, 32 per cent of the kids are in Catholic and independent schools, and they are getting 24 per cent of all of the public funding. - The reason it is necessary for the government to distribute factual information to Australian parents and Australian families about the funding of schools in this country is that the Australian Education Union, aided and abetted by the Australian Labor Party, is distributing misinformation by omission. It is seeking to instil fear and uncertainty into the budgets and lives of everyday Australians. The fact is that the Labor Party is trying to get the average Australian to wrongly believe that a school like King's receives more money than a public school does. The reality in that fact sheet - which I invite the member for Jagajaga to table, so it can receive much broader distribution - is that the 1,320 students at the King's School receive $3.6 million in public funding. Fairvale High School in New South Wales, with 1,370 students - so it basically has got about 50 more students - does not get $3.6 million, it does not get $10 million; it gets $16 million.In other words, the message that Cardinal Pell, the Prime Minister and I seek to honestly put across to Australians is that they need to understand that every single child in a Catholic, independent or - I say to the member for Melbourne Ports - Jewish day school receives less public money than they would if they were being educated in a state school. And yet the parents of those children have paid their taxes. They paid for a place in a state school. They have then forgone that place, often at an expense of several thousand dollars - the average fee paid last year was $2,850 - and at great expense to themselves, with four jobs between two parents, without ever having a holiday, driving a 15-year-old car and living in the far outer suburbs of large cities. They make those sacrifices to send their kids to those schools, and they will be supported by this government according to the needs of the families. The one thing the Labor Party has got to do - talk about a bunch of slow learners - is start to understand that the aspirations of working everyday Australians, one in five of whom earn less than $73 a day and have got their kids in Catholic and independent schools, are no different from those of many on the frontbench who have got their kids in the best schools in the country.</DOC>

As the member for Mackellar well knows, thanks to the sweetheart deal between the former Labor government and the Australian Labor Party, Centenary House rents increase at market rates or nine per cent, whichever is the greater. - I can understand the extreme sensitivity of members opposite because, thanks to this sweetheart deal, the Australian Labor Party have received a $36 million free gift. That is what they have had. - I simply make the point that the $36 million free gift that the Labor Party is getting is a lot more than any independent school is going to get.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. During the 2001 election campaign, I had the privilege of being able to doorknock in the electorate of Macarthur with the now member for Macarthur. Only two people said anything to us in two days about education and they both said the same thing: why is the Labor Party against you sending your kid to a private school?It seems that, in the past three years, nothing has changed. The fact is that the socioeconomic status system that the government introduced into the current quadrennium of school funding works on the basis of surveying households in groups of 250. The education, income and occupation of the families in those households then deliver a score which a child takes to a non-government school. In every single case, a student receives less money than if they were being educated in a government state school. The kids from the poorest families get 30 per cent less. The kids from the wealthiest families get 87 per cent less.There are two principles that this government strongly believes in. The first is that money is provided according to need and the second is that every child of every Australian citizen will receive some level of financial assistance to support their education. What the Labor Party is proposing - and what is behind this question - is a move to a system which says to some parents that their child is considered of so little value by the Australian Labor Party that he or she will receive nothing in support for their education. - What the SES system exposed is what anyone who is familiar with any non-government school in this country has known for a long time - that is, within all of these schools, whether it is Trinity Grammar, The King's School, St Cecilias, St Brigids or any of these other schools, are families who have made enormous sacrifices -  - to support the education of their children and who have gone without holidays, modern housing and modern cars. They have made sacrifices to send their children to these schools. The application of the SES score, which has now been joined by the National Catholic Education Commission and has been endorsed by Cardinal George Pell, is the reason why non-government schools in this country are receiving the support they both need and deserve. I table the school funding facts paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question. He has been a long-term advocate of the interests of small business. It was he who brought to my attention the demise of Peel Horseback Adventures, a company at Pinjarra in his electorate which was forced to close down because they could not obtain affordable insurance. The scenario is repeated. The member for Canning also raised with me a bakery in his electorate -  - which, in 2002, had a premium of $940. This year's premium is $1,380 - a rise of $440. There is an engineering business in his electorate whose premium has gone up from $800 last year to $6,000 this year because of rising public liability premiums.The Australian government wanted to do something about this. We took the view that, in partnership with the states, we had to have tort law reform, and the states kept their word. All of the states have passed legislation to change the law of negligence so that that can help to reduce the cost of insurance for community groups, sporting groups and, of course, small businesses. As part of that deal, the Commonwealth government would pass amendments to the Trade Practices Act that would reduce at the end of the day the insurance premiums for businesses, community groups and sporting clubs. But - shame on shame! - the Labor Party, at the last sitting of the Senate, rejected those amendments. The Labor Party, in partnership with the Democrats and the Independents, knocked off the joint amendments put forward by the states and the Commonwealth to reduce insurance premiums for businesses, community groups and sporting groups.The member for Canning asked me whether there are any additional views of support, and I say there are. Last Friday the New South Wales Labor Treasurer, Michael Egan, said - and, in case the member for Werriwa did not hear it or did not read the newspaper, I will repeat this plea from the New South Wales Labor Treasurer:I urge my Labor colleagues to pass the legislation that the government has presented to it. If anyone is dragging the chain, it is the Senate.Read `Senate', read `Labor Party'. The Labor Party and the Democrats are blocking our attempts to reduce the cost of insurance for community groups, small businesses and sporting clubs. The communique from the joint state Labor treasurers said:All governments have renewed their support for amendments to the Trade Practices Act to underpin state and territory personal law reform to be implemented as soon as possible.So we have the member for Lyons urging the Leader of the Opposition to change the Labor Party's view, we have the New South Wales Treasurer renewing that plea, and we have every Labor leader of the states and territories saying to the Labor Party in this place, `Please pass the amendments to the Trade Practices Act so we can collectively ensure that there is a reduction in the insurance premiums for small businesses, community groups and sporting clubs.'If the member for Werriwa needs to spend more time out in the community then this is a chance for him to do it. I just say to him: go out there and listen to these groups. Every member of this place has had members of the community come to them and say that the insurance premiums are affecting business or they are affecting events. I ask the Leader of the Opposition, on behalf of all those groups, to please agree to these amendments because these amendments are going to keep small businesses and community groups alive in the face of unprecedentedly high public liability insurance premiums.</DOC>

 - The federal government is happy to continue to pay for aged care beds - that is our responsibility. We will meet our responsibilities, but we are not going to pay for acute care beds, because that is clearly the responsibility of the state governments. The federal government, through the Australian health care agreements, has increased funding to the state governments in real terms by 17 per cent, and with all that extra money the least the state government could do is put that extra money into the Manangatang hospital.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. As he knows, Victoria is currently in industrial turmoil. We have a situation where small businesses, and this week parents and students of schools, are being threatened by industrial ransom. The reason is simply that a weak and craven Bracks Labor government in Victoria will not stand up to its union mates and will not govern for all Victorians. The result of this is a series of adverse impacts, particularly on small business in Victoria.In East Burwood, as the member for Deakin knows well, just last week at least 32 businesses were affected by this industrial action. A butcher in East Burwood had to throw out about $4,000 worth of meat because of irresponsible union bans; the owner of Dingley Charcoal Chicken lost some $4,000 worth of stock; an ice cream store owner, also in the same suburb, lost about $1,500 worth of dairy products; and a fruit shop owner lost some $5,000 worth of fruit - all because of this industrial action. Who is to blame? The fruit shop owner knows quite well. He was quoted in the Herald Sun last week, saying: I think it's the government's fault - that is, the Bracks Labor government -  They let the unions do what they want in Victoria. They are too scared of them.That is what the fruit shop owner said. In Victoria we see the power of legislation which is available to the Bracks government simply not being used. In Victoria we have a one-third higher industrial dispute rate than the average throughout Australia. After an illegal dispute at the Age newspaper printing works, a SundayAge editorial last week said:This raises the question of what role - if any - the State Government played in this appalling lapse of law enforcement. It went on to say:The signs are worrying.Unless the Bracks Government shows a willingness to condemn such actions and sees that the police are properly utilised to uphold the rule of law -  - It continues:corporate Australia may well take a view that Victoria is returning to the industrial dark ages when Trades Hall had a seat at the cabinet table and rogue unionists ruled the workplace.The member for Deakin asks about alternative policies. What we are seeing in Victoria at the present time is a foretaste of what we will have from the federal Labor Party under its workplace relations policy - the ability of unions and the union bosses to wreak havoc on small business and to cast aside the rule of law right throughout Australia. The indications are there. The Labor Party will not support this government's actions to clean up the building and construction industry. It wants union bosses also to be able to put a foot in the door of every small business in this country, whether or not they employ unionists, no matter what impact it will have on the economic activity of those businesses.The Leader of the Opposition is correct when he says that the unions are the industrial dinosaurs. The only pity with the Labor Party's policy is that now the Leader of the Opposition has joined the herd. Australia simply cannot afford this stampede of industrial dinosaurs led by the member for Werriwa. We need to be forward looking, not have a return to the industrial dark ages which we see in Victoria, with a weak government there, and which we will see if ever Labor is elected nationally.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. I have seen the Senate report. I think there is some material in it that is interesting, and the government is going to have a careful look at it. I want to thank the contribution made to the committee's deliberations, particularly by Queensland Liberal Senator George Brandis, who I think made a very erudite contribution.While we are on the subject of small business and the Trade Practices Act, let me remind the Australian parliament and the Australian public that, at the national conference, the Labor Party adopted a policy to take out of the Trade Practices Act the secondary boycott protection now available to small business. The Leader of the Opposition comes into this place saying, `I am the friend of small business.' If his policy were to be legislated and come into force, he would not be the protector of small business; he would be the destroyer of small business.I say to the Leader of the Opposition that we will look at that recommendation in the report. But I invite the Leader of the Opposition to look again at the consequences of his pro-union objection to the secondary boycott provisions which are now in the Trade Practices Act. These secondary boycott provisions were put into the Trade Practices Act by the then minister for business and consumer affairs in 1977. They were a very good set of amendments. They were taken out by the Labor Party at the behest of the trade union movement when Labor got into office, and we put them back in again. As far as I am concerned, while ever the Labor Party supports the removal of the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act, it is no friend of Australian small business.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page, who - along with many other members of the Liberal Party and The Nationals - is keenly aware of the difficulties faced by the Australian sugar industry. I think we would all agree that the Australian sugar industry is in a parlous state - and it is in a parlous state through no fault of its own. It is a victim of a corrupt world trading system, not a victim of its own inefficiency or indeed of its own unwillingness to adjust to substantial change.Substantial domestic reform will be needed, and I have already commenced discussions with representatives of the industry. I have been greatly aided in that endeavour by the advice that I have received from the government members' sugar task force, of which the member for Page is a member - a task force including a number of members of the Liberal Party and The Nationals. We do recognise the difficulties facing the sugar industry. Cabinet has already considered the matter and will give further consideration after some additional discussions that I will have with the industry and the Queensland government in the days and weeks ahead. In the mean time - not only in response to a genuine need but also as an earnest of our determination to give practical help to the industry - we do want to help those in most genuine need, and I announce today that the government will provide income support to sugar cane growers and harvesters who are experiencing financial hardship. From today, assistance will be available for 12 months, which will help ease the financial situation of those hardest hit by the current situation. Assistance will be paid at rates equivalent to the Newstart allowance. Canegrowers or harvesters interested in applying for assistance can contact Centrelink from today to register their intent to claim. Eligible recipients will receive payments backdated to today.This support is in addition to the $15 million the Australian government provided in income support in the 12 months to September 2003, as part of the $120 million sugar industry reform package. To ensure that the assistance is provided to those who need it most, income and assets tests similar to those used in the previous package will apply to the new package. A further estimated $5.6 million will be available for business planning support so that growers who qualify to receive income support will receive business planning support.I make two further points. We see this very much as an immediate response to the genuine need. It of course will not be the last word in relation to the government's assistance to the industry. I welcome the fact that the Queensland government has now reached agreement with the industry for some further changes to the Queensland legislation. When that is passed, it will lay the basis for some very sensible changes and reforms to the industry. I will meet, as I say, the representatives of the industry in the weeks ahead to have further discussions but I know that members on this side of the House who are interested in the sugar industry will welcome this not only as a genuine measure to help people in need but also as an earnest of our long-time commitment to find sensible, constructive, reformist plans and solutions to the Australian sugar industry.</DOC>

 - The government will not be supporting Labor policy in this area. I cannot help but contrast the courage of the British Labour Prime Minister in dragging his party kicking and screaming to support necessary reform with the weak failure of the current Leader of the Opposition to recognise that if we are ever to get policy for universities in this country on a sound footing we need to be honest enough with the student population of this country to say that the sorts of reforms this government has enacted are necessary. I remind the Leader of the Opposition and those who criticise the government that under the new reforms the average contribution of a student in a HECS funded place will be 28 per cent of the total cost of his or her education. In other words, 72 per cent of the cost of educating somebody at a tertiary institution will be provided by the government or will come from private sources. I ask any Australian who brings a fair-minded approach to this issue to suggest that that is unreasonable and unfair. It is the sort of tertiary education funding system that should have been adopted years ago in many European countries. Compare and contrast the parlous state of German universities, once the pride of the university world. Germany contributed so much in this area but there was the failure of governments in Europe and around the world to grasp the nettle and to recognise that you cannot go on forever pretending that you can provide essentially free university education. Ultimately, what the Labor Party is saying to the young of this country is that it is unreasonable to ask them to contribute 28 per cent of the cost of giving them a degree which is going to enable them to earn infinitely more money in their working lives than the rest of the Australian population.We have obligations to university students. We also have obligations to the future trades men and women of this country. We have obligations to the 60 or 70 per cent who do not go to university. We have obligations to the working men and women who pay their taxes and never see those taxes used to educate their sons and daughters in universities. I think what we piloted through the parliament at the end of the last year was an example of a government willing to undertake courageous long-term reform. We eschewed the populism of the opposition. I simply say to the Leader of the Opposition, who once said that he was an admirer of Tony Blair: have a look at Tony Blair's courage and feel ashamed of your own lack of courage.</DOC>

 - First I thank the member for Paterson for his question and, if I may say so, for his interest. I know that the people of Paterson have been very well served by him for a very long time. The unanimous passage of the mandatory United Nations Security Council resolution 1441 on 8 November 2002 demonstrated the international community's conviction about Iraq and its weapons of mass destruction. It recognised:... the threat Iraq's non-compliance with Council resolutions and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles poses to international peace and security ...The parliamentary joint committee's report, which was published yesterday, confirms that the government was right to believe that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and weapons of mass destruction capabilities before the war. The findings of the Iraq Survey Group, which was headed by Dr Kay, who resigned some weeks ago, since the war ended have revealed dozens of weapons of mass destruction programs in Iraq, and those programs confirm the assessments of Australian intelligence agencies. I appreciate the point that actual stockpiles have not been found. As George Tenet, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency said the other day, we will just have to wait and see in relation to the stockpiles, but the programs were clearly there.Are there any alternative views? The Labor Party, as the Prime Minister and I pointed out to the House yesterday, were running around the country saying that Saddam Hussein did have weapons of mass destruction, and now they are running around the country claiming that he did not - although I notice that they never quote the Iraq Survey Group saying that he had weapons of mass destruction programs; apparently those programs do not matter to the opposition. The member for Griffith now says, `Well, you see, we had intelligence briefings provided by the government and so we just went out and parroted what we heard at the intelligence briefings; so when we said that there were weapons of mass destruction programs, that was all the fault of our intelligence agencies.' Quite apart from anything else, I think it is a pretty disrespectful and appalling thing to suggest that our intelligence agencies are just some sort of political cipher of the government, which is the implication of what he said. But the second thing I would point out is that what the member for Griffith said - and it will not come as a shock to the House to hear this - was not actually true. The first briefing that the member for Griffith had from the Office of National Assessments on Iraq and weapons of mass destruction was on 25 September 2002, so I am advised, yet on Brisbane radio on 12 July - months before he ever had a briefing from the Office of National Assessments on this matter - he said:... it's a reasonable matter of public record that Saddam Hussein still possesses some chemical weapons and biological weapons capability.Then on 21 September he told Lateline:... Iraq's foreign minister is a liar. Iraq plainly possesses chemical and biological weapons agents and there's some evidence that those agents have been weaponised.But hang on, this was before the ONA briefings. So he is out there at the doorstop telling everybody, `The ONA has been sexing stuff up and telling me all sorts of false things,' but actually he was saying these things before he even spoke with ONA about this matter. The member for Hotham is now the shadow Treasurer and is still a very powerful figure in the Labor Party. I am told he is the puppeteer of the puppet called the Leader of the Opposition. I think it is interesting that on 15 January 2003 the member for Hotham said:I do believe that he - Saddam - has still weapons of mass destruction because there's no evidence to demonstrate that he got rid of that which he had, that pile of things that was established that he had back in 1999.Now hang on; who established in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had what the member for Hotham called a `pile of things'? It was none other than His Excellency the Governor of Tasmania, Richard Butler. The then Leader of the Opposition was not quoting our intelligence agencies as his source; he was quoting the Governor of Tasmania.Let me conclude on this point. The current Leader of the Opposition, in answer to a question on Radio 2UE on 12 January this year, said:Well I think they - that is, the government - made a mistake going to war in Iraq. Now whatever the reason or motivation was, I think it was a mistake.I think that fundamentally differentiates the government from the opposition. If the Leader of the Opposition's policy had been pursued, then today in power in Iraq would be Saddam Hussein - a man who not only presided over weapons of mass destruction programs and used these weapons against his own people and his neighbours in Iran but also whose regime was responsible for, as discovered since, 300,000 bodies in mass graves in Iraq. If the Leader of the Opposition's policy had been pursued, then that regime would still be in office today. The fact that we got rid of that regime and you wanted that regime to remain in office is an argument that between now and polling day we would be happy to have. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The member for Corio would be well aware of the comment that I made yesterday that we expected that hopefully today the text would be completed. I have also always said that -  - It is a big point. We have said that we want to get the legal language correct; it has to reflect what has been negotiated. We are in the process of discussing it with our team in the United States as we speak. There are over 900 pages in this text. This is the quickest we will have resolved it. But the big question still rests with the Labor Party: are they going to support this when it comes through?  - We are still working through final technical issues in the text.  - So what? - It is 20 years since we negotiated the last free trade agreement with a fully developed country.  - We want to ensure that this is right for Australia and we believe it will be. We have negotiated what is right for Australia and what is a good deal and we want to ensure that that is reflected in the legal document. - Can I just draw the attention of the House, seeing as I have been asked about the FTA, to a speech that was made yesterday by the Labor Party's shadow spokesman on trade, Senator Conroy. He basically set out three tests for this, and we sense that this is a bit of a movement in the Labor Party's position on this. He said that the deal must `not undermine the ability of Australian governments to provide and regulate essential services in health and education, including the PBS'. We have made it very clear that we have defended that position. His second point was that it must `not undermine the capacity of Australian governments to protect Australian culture by regulating for local content in the future delivery of audiovisual products'. That was point 2. We have protected that position. We made that very clear. Finally, point 3 was that it must not `undermine Australia's access to Asian markets - the primary destination for our exports - or our WTO or APEC objectives'. We have delivered. Yesterday in China an $11 billion deal was announced that has been done while we have been negotiating with the United States. So I would suggest to Senator Conroy that his objectives will be met and, when we have finished and are satisfied - on both sides - with the legal text, it will be made public. That is the answer to the member's question.</DOC>

 - First can I thank the honourable member for Flinders for his question. I know how closely he follows international relations issues, whilst at the same time working very hard in his own electorate down there on the Mornington Peninsula. What happened in Iraq last year with the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's brutal and barbaric regime did send a clear message to the world about the seriousness of the issue of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the determination of the international community nowadays to enforce international laws on nonproliferation.I think the sending of that message has been very important in encouraging Libya to make the decision it made to disarm of weapons of mass destruction. I think it has been significant in influencing consideration within Iran to become more forthcoming with the International Atomic Energy Agency, and it is clear that other countries, such as Syria and North Korea, are considering their options a great deal more carefully than they did over a year ago. Importantly, this has also opened up a wealth of information on the black market in weapons of mass destruction. The revelations in particular by Dr Kahn from Pakistan on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction materials have been very important, and the progress that has been made there is not to be underestimated.I welcome very warmly the agreement that was recently concluded in Beijing, just in the last few days, on North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Not to overclaim for what has been achieved, this agreement does institutionalise the six-party talks process. There will be a third round of talks, hopefully held before the end of June, and a working group is to be convened to prepare for that meeting. As I say, the outcomes, whilst modest, are positive signs that a peaceful and lasting resolution can be achieved, although I have no illusions that it is going to be a long process. We, as I think honourable members interested in international relations will know, have been contributing and contributing as much as we possibly can to the six-party talks process. I sent a high-level delegation led by Murray McLean from my department to North Korea at the end of January early February, urging them to participate in the six-party talks, and it was a very successful visit.In order to encourage North Korea's continuing engagement with the international community, I have now instructed Australia's ambassador designate to North Korea, Alan Thomas, who is also the Ambassador to Beijing, to travel to Pyongyang and to present his credentials. This will open up another channel for Australia to press North Korea on the key issues involved, including issues beyond North Korea. Now we look to North Korea to demonstrate good faith by engaging in talks and to commit to a complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantling of its nuclear weapons programs. Let me say in conclusion that the government is not alone in understanding the importance of our action in Iraq to the nonproliferation regime around the world. The member for Brand, who I think on the other side of the House is the most qualified member to understand and focus on these issues and has a real interest in them, on 1 March - just yesterday - said, `Countries such as Libya have clearly become more accommodating.' And that is right. As a result of what has happened in Iraq, the global nonproliferation regime has taken one giant step forward. If, on the other hand, the international community, particularly the Americans, had backed down in the case of Saddam Hussein and Iraq, the consequences I think for the global nonproliferation regime would have been very serious because it would have shown that the international community at the end of the day was not really very serious.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson for her question. I can inform the House that the balance of payments for the December quarter were released today. They showed a narrowing in relation to the current account deficit by some $81 million and a narrowing as a percentage of GDP from 6.2 per cent to 6.1 per cent. Having said that, that is still a significant current account deficit. The improvement in the figures was led by export volumes, which rose 3.3 per cent; in particular, rural goods and in particular a 43 per cent rise in cereal and grain exports. This is Australia coming back from the worst drought in 100 years. However, rural exports are still almost 10 per cent lower than pre-drought levels. So they are coming back, but we are not back to pre-drought levels. Imports increased 4.4 per cent in the December quarter and, despite the improvement in the current account deficit for the quarter, figures suggest that net exports detracted 0.5 per cent from GDP growth. We will be getting the national accounts tomorrow. The net foreign debt increased to $374 billion. As a percentage of GDP that is 49 per cent. That is where it was 12 months ago. But the debt-servicing ratio is still quite low; not as low as the 20-year record that we had earlier, in the June and September quarters, of 8.3 per cent but still low at 8.7 per cent.I can also inform the House that retail trade figures for the month of January were released today, with nominal retail trade increasing by 0.7 per cent to be 8.8 per cent higher than a year ago. This is consistent with the record consumer confidence that the consumer surveys are reporting.The Australian economy continues to perform as one of the stronger economies of the developed world, supported by low inflation, low interest rates, growing employment and an unemployment rate which has been below six per cent for four or five months, having weathered the worst drought in Australia's 100-year records. But the importance of economic management goes on. We did not get through the Asian financial crisis, the US recession and the drought by resting on our laurels. We worked hard at consistent economic policy. It is important that all Australians recognise the importance of economic management and policy. We would not, for example, want to get our budget into the kind of deficit that the Americans are now experiencing - or even the British and most of Europe and certainly Japan.That disciplined economic policy is required to see Australia through these difficult times. That is the kind of leadership which this government has been giving over the last eight years. It is the leadership we intend to give. It would be easier to do that if the opposition would vote for sensible economic reform. The member for Werriwa, the Leader of the Opposition, has an opportunity to prove that he is different from the member for Hotham. He could prove it by voting for the government's economic reform. We call on him again to do so in relation to disability support pensions, pharmaceutical benefits, unfair dismissal, labour markets and the reforms that are necessary to set Australia up for the great demographic change which is coming.</DOC>

We have achieved -  - Obviously many members of the Labor Party are still against this agreement.

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The answer is that the government has a very wide-ranging and comprehensive set of policies undergirding regional industries and jobs in regional areas. It is worth reminding ourselves of some examples over and beyond the bedrock issue of very sound economic management and industrial relations reform - not least of all on the waterfront, to the great benefit of our exporters. We have not only retained the diesel fuel rebate for agriculture and mining but also overseen massive reductions in the effective fuel excise rates for transport in this country, to the great advantage of our export and regionally based industries. While we take greenhouse gas emissions seriously, we have refused to sign the Kyoto protocol because we think it is a flawed approach and it would cost a great number of regional jobs.We have a clear policy on Sydney airport, which includes guaranteed regional access. We have a wide range of regional programs, two of which were, interestingly, singled out last week by the New South Wales Minister for Regional Development, David Campbell, who described them as invaluable and tried to beat up a case that we would have to abandon them under the free trade agreement - which, as he knew, was not right. But he did describe them as invaluable, and that is not surprising when you look at the sorts of things we have been achieving. For example, we have now helped to place 900 mobile phone towers in rural and regional Australia, with 98 per cent of the population of Australia now having phone coverage; and, in over 300 towns, through the rural transaction centres, we have put back face-to-face banking for people in rural areas. As the Prime Minister said, we are a strong supporter of the people in the sugar industry and the communities that depend upon that great industry. We recently announced a continuation of the Roads to Recovery program, which was very widely welcomed in rural areas. It would be remiss of me not to mention the $1 billion that we have committed to regional Australians in the worst drought in 100 years. I was asked about alternative programs. We recently had a new Leader of the Opposition come to the realisation that there were some regional marginals out there and that he would like to capture some of them. It is about time the Labor Party took these regional seats seriously. Before he contemplated his regional tour, the Leader of the Opposition did the obvious thing and went along to the Labor spokesperson for regional affairs, the member for Batman, and said, `I'd like a copy of our regional policies.' The member for Batman said, `Our what?' `Our regional policies,' the Leader of the Opposition said. `We need to convince people in regional Australia that we take them seriously - and you have been in the shadow portfolio for how long? I would like our regional policies.' The member for Batman said, `The previous member for Dickson, Ms Kernot, promised that she had it almost ready and that it was in the top drawer, ready for me to dust off, when I became the minister. I have had a lot of trouble pulling anything together since then.'`Well,' says the Leader of the Opposition. `That is a bit of a problem. What can we talk about out there, when I go out into the regions? When I go up to Tamworth or up to the north coast, what am I going to talk about? They like roads out there.' The member for Batman says, `The problem with talking about roads is that they have introduced a program called Roads to Recovery, which the bush loves, and we call it a boondoggle.' `Perhaps we could talk about communications - that's a good one,' the Leader of the Opposition says. `I don't know about that one,' says the member for Batman. `We closed down the analog phone service, we closed down the bush's mobile phone service, and they put it back. So maybe we have not got too much to flog on that one.' `What about banks?' says the Leader of the Opposition. `A lot of country people have lost their banks.' `I don't know,' says the member for Batman. `I don't think the coalition's record is too bad there either. Across Australia, 318 small communities have got back face-to-face banking services because of the coalition's activities.' `Oh,' says the Leader of the Opposition. `What about fuel taxes?' The member for Batman says, `Their record is pretty good there too. They have not only retained all the benefits of the diesel fuel rebate but also extended it massively for transport. But we are proposing to take it all back again from the mining industry to fund social programs.' `Well, there's climate change,' says the Leader of the Opposition. `We could talk about climate change.' `No, I don't think you ought to do that,' says the member for Batman, `because when you were campaigning for the seat of Cunningham, you said, 'No, we shouldn't sign Kyoto, because it would cost 10,000 jobs in Wollongong.'' But now the new Mark Latham says we should sign it. On the face of all of this, he says, `Perhaps we could talk about sugar.' That is not a good idea, because the shadow minister for community relations - the shadow minister for hugs - has gone a bit sour on the sugar industry and says, `No, they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it and they should not spend any more. We don't love the sugar industry.' So do you know what the Leader of the Opposition decided he should talk about? I could not believe it. I find, in my own home paper, the Namoi Valley Independent, the amazing little subheading `New Labor leader says he's an ethanol supporter'. The article goes on to say, `Latham signals support for ethanol industry. On his 'opportunities for all' coach tour of the north-west last week, the opposition leader said the Labor Party had always supported an alternative fuels industry in Australia, and it would continue to do so.' Did you tell your shadow finance spokesman?  - I conclude by saying it takes a while to work through everything we have done for regional Australia and quite a while to work through the paucity of policies from those opposite. I conclude by simply making the observation that this has shades of when Whitlam, in the worst depression in the bush prior to the drought we have just had, told farmers they had never had it so good.</DOC>

 - I have not seen what the chairman said. I never take as gospel what those who sit opposite say about what we who sit here say. Let me simply address the question of legality. The action taken by the government to join the coalition of the willing was soundly based in international law, and the reasons for that were set out in the joint opinion that was tabled at the time that hostilities commenced. I remind the member for Griffith, again, that the legal basis of our involvement with the coalition of the willing was the serial noncompliance by Iraq with successive resolutions of the United Nations. I remind the member for Griffith of what he said on 24 September 2002, when he said, `Do Iraq possess weapons of mass destruction? Yes, they do.' - The member for Griffith seems to be in serial denial about what he said at the time the war broke out. The problem that the member for Griffith has is that he was as fervent as anyone in asserting that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. I know he wants to deny it, but the basis of the Labor Party's dissent was that we should not join the coalition of the willing but wait interminably for further action to be taken by the United Nations. What the member for Griffith wanted us to do was to leave a quarter of a million American, British and Australian troops in the desert. He was happy for them to exert some kind of coercive influence on Saddam Hussein to deal with the weapons inspectors but, quite unreasonably, he wanted them to remain there indefinitely.The difference between this side of the House and the other side of the House on this issue was summarised by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. If the Labor Party's advice had been followed, Saddam would still be running Iraq. If the Labor Party's advice had been followed, the human rights abuses that have been uncovered since the end of hostilities would have been multiplied. - I would say to the member for Griffith, the member for Hotham and the Leader of the Opposition that they have the heavy burden of justifying to the Australian people why they supported a policy that would have kept Saddam Hussein in power. That is the burden that those who sit opposite carry. The member for Griffith can bob and weave; the member for Griffith can say what he likes. - It is plain for all of the Australian public to see that the Labor Party supported a policy that would have kept Saddam Hussein in power. That was the practical consequence of the policy that you supported, and that will be to your everlasting political shame.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question and for his continued support for small business operators in his electorate. As the member for Canning knows, this government has created labour market conditions in which small business - which is, after all, the backbone of the Australian economy - has been able to prosper. The workplace changes that this government has put in place have had the objective of making it simpler for small business to operate, rather than the complicated and complex system that the Labor Party supports of workplace relations in Australia written by industrial lawyers for industrial lawyers and union bosses. An example of this is the improvements in the unfair dismissal laws, where we again want to make it simpler for small business to operate. These are laws which the Australian Labor Party have voted against - not once, not twice, not three times and not even four or five times but on 39 separate occasions. The Australian Labor Party's platform is an attack on small business. The Australian Labor Party wants to reintroduce in Australia a complicated and complex award system that will mean intervention in every minute of every day for every worker in this country. The Australian Labor Party wants to destroy casual employment in this country, even though it benefits tens of thousands of people, particularly young people. The Australian Labor Party wants to give unions in this country and the big union bosses the right to step inside the door of every business in this country, even those that do not employ unionists. The Australian Labor Party wants to abolish junior wage rates in awards and, most astonishing of all, it wants to award government contracts to union-friendly firms. In other words, this is code for saying that, if you do not employ union members as workers within the firm, do not bother applying for government contracts. This is not just rhetoric; this is signed and sealed Labor Party policy. As the Leader of the Opposition said at the end of January, once the platform is adopted it is binding on everyone in the party - from the new greenhorn recruit out in the branches of my electorate right through to the federal parliamentary leader. It is signed and sealed Labor Party policy attacking small business. No wonder the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, said `We never pretended to be a small business party.' That is so true. Labor might have a new leader but it is the same old Labor. A letter just happened to fall into my hands recently from the Combined Small Business Alliance of Western Australia, dated 3 February. It is addressed to Mr Mark Latham MP, Leader of the Opposition of the Labor Party. Amongst other things, it says:The reports arising from the ALP national conference reflect a sad indictment on federal Labor's lack of understanding of the needs and aspirations of small business and, furthermore, reflect that you and your party couldn't care less.The letter also says of an ALP federal government:Small business should be afraid, very afraid.That is what small business is saying about the Australian Labor Party. I invite the Leader of the Opposition to release the letter.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I thank you very much for clearing up that matter from yesterday, and I very much thank the member for Mackellar for her question. I congratulate her on the 10-year campaign she has waged against Labor's rent rort. It is quite interesting that in the private member's debate yesterday not a single Labor member defended the Centenary House deal, for the simple reason that it is indefensible. The essential facts of the rent rort are these: the Labor Party is getting more for an undistinguished office in suburban Canberra than a landlord would get for top quality leasehold offices in downtown Manhattan. The commercial tenant is paying $314 a square metre but the Labor Party is getting $871 a square metre. This is the $36 million free gift from the taxpayer. This is the Labor Party's secret `weapon of mass remuneration'. This is the stinking dead cat at the heart of the Labor Party's finances which the Leader of the Opposition will not do anything about it. The Leader of the Opposition has won the world's greatest jackpot, only this was no lottery; this was a sure thing.The Labor Party keep saying they cannot do anything about the rent rort because they cannot afford it. They say they cannot afford it, even though they have converted the nine per cent mortgage with Macquarie Bank into a six per cent mortgage with Westpac. Westpac knows something about the Canberra property market. They have just put out their latest Australian property office market outlook for 2004-06. Blow me down if it does not forecast rental growth for property in Canberra of just 2.5 per cent, prepared to the guaranteed nine per cent that the Leader of the Opposition is getting under Labor's rent rort. This is not in the past; this is now. This is not Paul Keating's rort; this is Mark Latham's rort, because he is the beneficiary. This is the Leader of the Opposition's rort, because he is the beneficiary. In 2004, the Leader of the Opposition is getting $3.9 million above market rates.  - Very touchy, aren't we? - Mr Speaker, I would certainly not want to cast any imputations on anyone, but I think it is important that people understand the embarrassment that the members opposite are suffering over the rivers of gold that are flowing into their coffers -  - I am glad to indicate out of respect for you, Mr Speaker, that the Leader of the Opposition is the beneficiary of this money which is flowing into the Labor Party's coffers. I made no further imputation, no further inference. He is the beneficiary of $3.9 million this year, of $4.4 million -   - Mr Speaker, out of respect for you I say it is not just him that is a beneficiary, it is all of them. They are all the beneficiaries of these rivers of ill-gotten gold flowing into the Labor Party's coffers  -  - Another sensitive soul. End the rorts and you won't have the embarrassment. - I can understand the embarrassment that members opposite are feeling -  - but let me for their benefit point out how much money is flowing into their collective coffers: $3.9 million above market rents in 2004, $4.4 million above market rents in 2005, $4.9 million above market rents in 2006 and $5.5 million above market rents in 2007 - a grand total of $36 million over the 15-year life of this lease which should never have been signed. The Leader of the Opposition has been trying to look warm and cuddly lately. He can afford to look warm and cuddly because he is wrapped in Labor's lease fleece; he is wrapped in the great Labor lease fleece and, if he was a real leader, he would do something about this stinking dead cat. He would renegotiate this lease and he would end the rent rort now. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question, which is especially appropriate today as the annual Agricultural Outlook conference is being held in Canberra when the industry looks to its future and what the opportunities might be in the year ahead. Obviously in the honourable member's electorate and in quite a number of others drought has been the dominant theme in agriculture over the past 12 months, but it is encouraging to note from the outlook conference that the prospects look better for the year ahead than they did this time last year. The predictions are that, following a record winter grain crop, led especially by Victoria and Western Australia, grain farmers will be beginning to recoup some of the losses that they have incurred over the previous poor seasons. Assuming average seasonal conditions, farm production is forecast to increase by two per cent in the year ahead across beef, wheat, wine, wool, dairy and horticulture. This demonstrates once again the strong resilience and capabilities of Australian farmers to bounce back once a drought is over. However, the prospects for farm prices in the year ahead are a little weaker as a result of increased competition on the world markets and, of course, the strength of the Australian dollar. However, in spite of those factors, Australian exports are expected to increase by four per cent, to $25.3 billion, in 2004-05 and in real terms by 12 per cent, to $28.3 billion, by 2008-09. Those are encouraging figures for agriculture, which has played a tremendous part in the economy, particularly in the second half of last year, when a 17.3 per cent growth contributed enormously to our national economic development.Australia's agriculture industries have of course been greatly assisted by the policies of this government. Getting rid of taxes on all our exports - in a country that exports two-thirds of everything that we produce - has made our industries much more competitive. But when times get tough we have also been willing to assist. This assistance includes more than $1 billion in drought assistance and, in another example today, the Prime Minister indicating our willingness to support cane farmers with some of their basic family needs as they go through a period of difficulty. Unfortunately, the industry does not enjoy the same support from those opposite. At the very time when the Leader of the Opposition was in North Queensland being shown what a sugar cane looked like, he had the member for Melbourne condemning farmers in Queensland and condemning this government for providing any assistance at all to the cane industry. So it is pretty clear where the message is in Melbourne and Sydney. It is only when the Leader of the Opposition gets to Cairns or Townsville that he has any sympathy for the industry at all. So we are looking forward to some kind of a response from the opposition to support the government in its package of assistance to the industry. We will stand by farmers. Their prospects are better for the year ahead, but there is still a long way to go before farmers recover from the drought. </DOC>

 - I have not seen that particular research, but I will accept that it says what the Leader of the Opposition asserts. I have been asked this before, and I share the concern of the Leader of the Opposition. But I have to ask the question: what on earth are the states doing with all that GST revenue? - For years and years, state governments of both political persuasions begged a federal government to give them a growth tax. Richard Court did it, Jeff Kennett did it, Neville Wran did it, Bob Carr did it and Peter Beattie has done it. Now, finally, they get a growth tax, and what do they do? They avoid their own constitutional responsibilities. We hear a lot in this country about rights and responsibilities. It is the responsibility of the states. - They have to discharge their responsibilities as well as assert their rights. They cannot have it both ways. They cannot wax fat on the proceeds of the GST yet run away from their responsibilities in dental health to their own citizens.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. She visited Baghdad with me in May last year and has had an ongoing interest in, particularly, the human rights and humanitarian situation in Iraq, both before and since the war. In response to the atrocities that have been committed by terrorists in both Iraq and Pakistan, the government has one message: terrorists will not be allowed to win. We condemn the vicious attacks against Shiite worshippers on the holiest day in the Shiah calendar, attacks which occurred in both Iraq and Pakistan. Let me take this opportunity to extend our condolences to the families and loved ones of the victims. At this stage it is unclear who the perpetrators of these attacks were, but one thing is certain: these terrorists are as much an enemy of moderate Islam and Muslims as they are an enemy of the West and Western countries. It is very important that people understand that. Here is almost certainly another example of Islamic fundamentalist terrorists attacking Muslims on one of their holiest, most sacred days.The people and leaders of Iraq and Pakistan are going to have our full support in the efforts they make to wage war against terrorists. I met with General Musharraf, the President of Pakistan, in January in Davos, and I took the opportunity to reiterate the Australian government's view that we hope that he will continue to do all he can against terrorist organisations, particularly those operating along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. He told me at the time that Pakistan would be doing more to address that problem than had been the case, and he has been true to his word. The Iraqi foreign minister in January told me - and I think this is an important point for people to understand - that the ordinary Iraqi people were increasingly angered by foreign terrorist activities in Iraq. What has happened in Iraq over the last day will only consolidate the view of the Iraqi people that these terrorists have to be defeated. It is only appropriate that a country like Australia should join with our allies and our friends in fighting terrorism wherever we can and wherever it occurs, including in both Iraq and Pakistan.</DOC>

 - I have several answers to that. The first answer is that $36 billion would pay for a lot of reading aloud. The second answer is that the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition proceeds upon the erroneous basis that there are, in fact, no programs already in place addressing the challenges of early childhood. Almost four years ago I announced, along with the then Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Newman, a program of several hundred million dollars which was designed to strengthen families and communities - phrases that I know the Leader of the Opposition would want to identify himself with. Many of those programs involved the challenges of early childhood. They also involved the provision of additional support in areas where traditional methods of child care were not readily available, such as isolated regional and remote communities - areas of Australia that are persistently ignored and rejected by the Australian Labor Party.The Leader of the Opposition asked me about the office of information technology. Perhaps that is not the correct name but I think we are talking about the same thing. I would have thought that support for that branch of the Australian economy, which is one of the fastest growing, is of enormous long-term benefit. In the circumstances, I would have thought that criticism made by the Leader of the Opposition in relation to something that is very relevant to the long-term growth and strength of the Australian economy is something that ought to be supported rather than opposed.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macarthur for his question and recognise him as the best representative of the western suburbs of Sydney in his area - an authentic voice of the western suburbs of Sydney, unlike other pretenders. I also acknowledge the other representatives who assist him on this side of the House. -  - Today I can inform the House that the December quarter national accounts were released this morning showing that, in the December quarter of last year, the Australian economy grew at 1.4 per cent, the fastest rate of quarterly growth for four years. In addition to that, the economy grew on an annualised basis through the year at four per cent which puts us again at the top of the table of the developed economies of the world as one of the fastest and strongest growing economies. Particularly pleasing was the fact that farm production rose 13.3 per cent in December, building on a 14 per cent increase in September. That is coming off a 100-year bad drought, so we are coming off a low base. It is particularly pleasing to see agricultural production rebuilding and it is being led by grain. The restocking of herds will take some time.Household consumption was strong, reflecting recovery in tourism and the Rugby World Cup tourism effects in Australia during the quarter. Particularly pleasing was private investment, which grew strongly, and new engineering construction, which has increased over the year by 22½ per cent in Australia. I will give the House a list of some of the engineering projects which are leading big business investment in this country: the Bayu-Undan gasfield in the Northern Territory; the expansion of the North West Shelf LNG project - fourth train - $1.6 billion; the Western Sydney Orbital, $1.5 billion, linking Liverpool and Newcastle; the Gladstone Alumina Refinery, an investment of $1.5 billion; in Victoria the Queen Victoria redevelopment and the Spencer Street Station redevelopment; and in South Australia the Olympic Dam project. I know that the member for Solomon would want me to remind the House about the completion of the Alice Springs to Darwin rail line - one of the major new engineering projects that we have seen in Australia.The other pleasing part of the national accounts is that profits were strong in the quarter. The profit share of total income in Australia, at 25.6 per cent, is the highest profit share ever recorded in Australian history. Business has never been more profitable than it was in the December quarter of 2003 as a share of a growing economy. This is not some accident. After eight years of economic management - we saw Asia go into a financial and economic crisis, we saw the United States, France and Germany go through a recession and Japan go through two recessions, we saw SARS, we had war in Iraq and we had the worst drought in 100 years - the Australian economy continued to grow because there was a purpose and a discipline to economic management. You do not govern your economic policy by downloading the latest theory from the Google search engine on the Internet.The member for Brand had the noodle nation and the member for Werriwa has the Google nation - downloading economic policy, chopping and changing from day to day, but without any constancy of purpose. The big changes that have strengthened the Australian economy - balancing the budget, repaying $60 billion worth of Labor debt, introducing a new tax system and reforming industrial relations in this country - were changes where this government led. We would have led faster if the Labor Party had supported decent reform. Even today we call on the now member for Werriwa to stand up for some economic reform in the Senate and to pass budget measures, which have now been stalled for two years in the Senate, so that Australia can have a better future.</DOC>

 - The member for Hotham asks the government a question about spending sprees! What I can confirm is that when you were last a member of a government you left this country $96 billion in debt. I can confirm that in the time we have been in government, which was eight years as of yesterday, we have delivered five surplus budgets. We delivered surpluses of $1.2 billion in 1997, $4.3 billion in 1998, $13 billion in 1999, $5.97 billion in 2001 and $7.5 billion in 2002-03. The reality is that, when it comes to spending sprees, Labor governments leave everybody in their wake. When they have an opportunity to actually do something, they outspend the biggest spenders of all time. They also leave to future generations enormous budget deficits. - All the expenditure that this government has presided over has been directed towards strengthening the national security and defence of this country. - I wonder if the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Hotham think it was a bad thing to spend more money on national security. I wonder if they think it was a bad thing to spend money on Roads to Recovery. I wonder if they still regard that as a boondoggle. I wonder if the real reason why you are opposing the passage of the government's new safety net for Australian families with their health costs is because you are opposed to that additional expenditure or because you have some other priority. Your leader talks a lot about children; the greatest beneficiaries of the new safety net will be families with young children. The families of Australia that incur out-of-pocket expenses are the people who will be the greatest beneficiaries. Every day that the opposition delays that legislation in the Senate they are denying the interests of the children of Australia. It is one thing to extol the virtues of reading to children; I think it is even more important to extol the virtues of helping families with the health costs of their children. Those things are very important to battling Australian families. Can I finally say that the last people who have any credibility in this parliament -  - I simply conclude my answer by saying that there is a lot of rhetoric from the other side about the rights and interests of Australian children. If you care about them and their health costs, get out of the way and pass that safety net.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fairfax for his question and for the opportunity to comment on the importance of national security arrangements. This government believes that it is incumbent upon it to take appropriate steps to protect the Australian community. As I have said before - and particularly in the statement that I made in the week before last - Australians have a fundamental human right to live in safety and security, and governments have a fundamental obligation to provide that safety net for the Australian community as a whole. People should be able to live without fear of terrorist groups operating with impunity within our borders. We have always acted quickly and decisively to deal with these issues, and we believe that governments should always have the powers to do just that - for instance, to quickly and decisively list terrorist organisations that pose a threat to our national security. We need appropriate safety mechanisms that do not leave us reliant on other bodies such as the United Nations, or perhaps a court or a tribunal, to determine that it is appropriate for the government to make a decision in relation to those matters.I am pleased to say the opposition has indicated that it will now be supporting amendments to the terrorist crimes legislation that is before the Senate at this time. That will effectively allow for the proscription of a terrorist organisation by the government without necessarily having to have a notification by the United Nations and without the precondition that a court or tribunal consent to it before the government can act. I thank the opposition for the indication of its agreement in relation to that matter. But I might say that I am disappointed that it has taken some two years and a lot of negotiation to reach this point - because to get to a point where we have reasonable powers that enable the government to act quickly on this matter without having to recall this parliament and the Senate to pass a bill specifically case by case is only sensible. We know that Labor initially would only support a listing if the United Nations Security Council had agreed to that listing. We know from the past that the United Nations lists many organisations but not all terrorist organisations - and there are reasons for that. Labor then said, `Look, we'll only agree to it if you have a court approve beforehand that it is appropriate to have a proscription decision.' Then it was suggested that we should have the AAT do it; and then it was suggested that we should have the AAT provide an advisory opinion. I simply note that no government would be in a position to act promptly and quickly in relation to these matters if they did not have a proscription power in the form that we have sought.I note that the opposition have also said that, if they were elected to government, they would revert to a court based approval before acting. I must say I think that sits uncomfortably with what the Leader of the Opposition has had to say, and that is:When I have to make a decision on Australia's national security, I will ask only one question: what is in Australia's national interest?I think it is incumbent upon the Leader of the Opposition to make it clear that, if he is going to lead on these issues, this policy - which harks back to the roll-back of his predecessors - will be abandoned.</DOC>

 - With your leave, Mr Speaker, I will have to reprimand the Chief Government Whip for not informing me that we had won Hotham in a by-election. You ask me to identify some of the savings. I can identify some savings that have not been realised, for which you are to blame. - Mr Speaker, I can start by identifying $1.1 billion of savings over four years which could have been realised if the necessary reforms in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme had not been lost. They were contained in a budget two years ago. The reality is that, over the last eight years, the only savings in difficult areas that this government have been able to achieve have been achieved with the support of Independents and minor parties. We have received no help from the Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party left us with the irresponsible double: they left us with $96 billion of debt and they tried to block every single attempt of the government to repay that debt. Not only did the Australian Labor Party leave the country in debt; after we set about with a mandate from the Australian people to do something about it, that party have at no stage - firstly under the leadership of the member for Brand, then under the leadership of the member for Hotham and now under the leadership of the member for Werriwa - joined in trying to bring about sensible savings in the budget.We put up an eminently reasonable proposal two years ago. Everybody knows that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, if proper copayment arrangements are not in place, will over the years become unaffordable. It is one of the very important social welfare planks of this country. It is something that is the envy of the world. But as new drugs become available and inevitably health care, as a consequence, becomes more expensive, unless the reforms that were contained in the budget two years ago are enacted, that scheme will become increasingly unaffordable. You have a simple case. The Labor Party have raised the issue of savings. If the Labor Party care about savings, they will immediately in this question time indicate that they will pass those reforms to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. You have an opportunity. The Leader of the Opposition and the member for Hotham have a wonderful opportunity to give effect to their rhetoric. They care about savings; they say savings should be made. - We have put up a proposal and they are using their numbers in the Senate to block it. If they want to give credibility to their concern about savings, I say, `Pass the pharmaceutical benefits reform.' You can announce it today and you can give effect to it tomorrow.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question and the interest he has shown in this. Honourable members may be interested to know that the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, announced last week that the British government was negotiating the establishment of some kind of offshore processing facility in Tanzania. This of course is not an identical situation with the offshore processing centre that we have in Nauru, but it is an endeavour by the Blair government to try to deal with the situation where, in particular, Somalis or people posing as Somalis may try to seek asylum in the United Kingdom. They can instead be processed in Tanzania so the problem does not become unsolvable. I understand from media reports that negotiations with South Africa for a similar sort of facility may be under way.The point I am making here is that the Blair government is an example of a government that has taken a tough approach to illegal immigration and people-smuggling, for good reason. I do not think anybody in Britain or too many people in Australia think that people-smuggling is to be encouraged. It has to be stopped. The British Home Secretary, Mr Blunkett, announced last week that tighter border controls, tough new legislative measures and enforced removals had halved the number of illegal arrivals entering Britain. The Blair government is about to pass tougher legislation preventing illegal arrivals from tying up the court system. I am sure our AttorneyGeneral would be pleased to hear about that. The court system in the UK has been tied up, as has been the case here, with appeal after appeal, and of course that is not an acceptable longterm solution.I was interested to hear, though, that within days of Prime Minister Blair making his announcements on strengthening the approach to dealing with illegal immigration the Australian Labor Party spokesperson for immigration - and this was in a doorstop on 19 February - was calling the deterrent effect of offshore processing a `complete nonsense' and saying that the Pacific solution has to go. This is quite an interesting point. The Labor Party pay lip-service to the evils of people-smuggling, but they refuse to support the government's tough measures to stamp out the people-smuggling trade. Labor oppose offshore processing, they oppose excision and they oppose, interestingly, the most effective policy of all - turning boats back. Labor would have actually allowed the Minasa Bone to land, letting the people smugglers deliver their cargo, letting 14 Turkish nationals - none of whom, as it turned out, were refugees - come to Australia and clog up our courts even more. All 14 people have, under this government's policy, been returned to Turkey. That is where they are - in Turkey where they belong.The simple fact is that deterrence has been shown to work. I have said this before: the Labor Party say that the way to fix this problem is to close down the offshore processing centres and to get rid of the excision policy to allow the boats to land. And what else are they going to do? They are going to set up a coastguard. But they never actually tell you what the coastguard is supposed to do. After the coastguard goes out there and meets a boat that is coming to Australia, what is it going to do? It is going to guide the boat into Australia, because that is the Labor policy. In other words, the coastguard is a coast guide. That is its job. All I can say is that the Labor Party in Australia have none of the courage or commonsense of New Labour in the United Kingdom. </DOC>

 - I cannot confirm or deny without checking the exact figures that have been used by the member for Fraser. But I can confirm that when it comes to budgetary and fiscal policy this government has been a world leader and a world performer. It is a very interesting tack. On the day that it is revealed that growth in the Australian economy has now returned to an annual rate of four per cent; when it is revealed, as the Treasurer indicated, that we are now enjoying the highest profit level in the history of our nation; when it is revealed that labour productivity as measured by GDP per hour worked in the market sector increased by 3.1 per cent over the past year; when it is revealed that consumer prices remain very well contained, with the household consumption deflator rising by only 1.2 per cent a year; when it is self-evident that, because of the economic management of this government, we have not only been able to deliver the lowest unemployment in 23 years but also been able to achieve the double of unemployment below six per cent and inflation below three per cent; when it is revealed that under this government real wages have risen by 13 per cent in real terms, whereas in 13 years of Labor government it rose by a little over three per cent; when it is revealed that the wealth of this country as measured by the growth in the GDP has grown significantly - when all of that evidence is in front of the opposition, the member for Fraser presumes to give us on this side of the House some kind of lecture about budget discipline. They are professors emeriti when it comes to budget ill-discipline. They left us with that enormous debt. They ran deficit after deficit, they misled the Australian public through the entirety of the 1993 election campaign, and they then sought to retrieve their budget position by massive increases in indirect tax. Let me simply say to the member for Fraser: the Labor Party has no credibility when it comes to budget discipline. You had your chance for 13 years, and you left behind economic ruin and wreckage.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Indi for her question and note her very real interest in farm sector performance and some of the issues that go with it, like the security and return on those investments. The latest farm financial performance figures have just been released by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Research Economics at the outlook conference now underway in Canberra. This year 42 per cent of farms will register a business loss, and average farm business profit will be a bare $12,600. In fact, off farm income for the average farm family will be about double the business profit from the farm, given that, surprisingly and interestingly, the average Australian farm now generates around $25,000 a year in off farm income. That is often extraordinarily important to those farm families.Interestingly, the rate of return to capital on the average farm in Australia will be negative for some sectors, but the average across all farms will be just 1.8 per cent. And that is in a recovery year. This, of course, reflects the historically low rates of return on capital that farmers face. Indeed, even in 2001-02, which was a good year, return to capital in the farm sector only reached 3.7 per cent, which is about as good as it gets. Last year in the drought year, return to capital was negative.In this context, I am asked about a national policy response. It is, of course, very important in those circumstances that you have a government that is in control of the economic levers, that keeps interest rates as low as possible and that ensures that the trade unions are not able to reintroduce inefficiencies on the waterfront, in the transport chain and in all of those service industries that are so important to agriculture. It is very important too that the Commonwealth continue to take a strong lead on the security of title that farmers enjoy. Their titles are being hollowed out by state governments that are continually exercising actions that introduce unacceptable sovereign risk to bankers and undermine the investment security that they are able to enjoy.Yesterday I was able to tell the House that the ethanol industry had found a new friend. Today I can tell the House that farmers have found a new friend: it is the Leader of the Opposition. I am indebted to the Northern Daily Leader, that erstwhile journal from Tamworth, which tells us that the Leader of the Opposition has been out there and visited a farm. He had a few things to say. When he finished the farm tour, he was interviewed and said: `I certainly learnt some things.' He went on to say, `I now realise that farming is more than just an enterprise, it is also a lifestyle.' That is probably a pretty important factor to keep in mind because, I have to say on behalf of Australia's farmers, you would not do the job for the rate of return on capital - you really would not. You would go and invest in other forms of capital if you wanted a good return. - Centenary House might be a bit better than 1.8 per cent. Australia's farmers do it because they love the lifestyle. They would not do it just to provide Australians - much as they love urban Australians - with the highest quality and lowest priced foodstuffs in the world. It is largely about lifestyle - so that is an important revelation. But he continued. The Leader of the Opposition said, `This is my first visit as Leader of the Opposition and I am looking forward to coming back many, many times.' - Yes, as Leader of the Opposition. He could go back many times. I reckon, armed with the knowledge that the Australian return to capital on farms is 1.8 per cent, he will find a great deal of interest out there in an alternative form of property investment that releases 18 per cent a year, with a nine per cent escalator. I reckon he could run some seminars out there on how farmers can be the beneficiaries of more secure titles and much higher property returns just like the Australian Labor Party - farmers, 1.8 per cent; the ALP, 18 per cent with a nine per cent escalator. That is the blockbuster of all boondoggles.I am also indebted to all these regional papers that follow the Leader of the Opposition around. He was up in Gladstone, and he must have said something that impressed the editor of the Gladstone newspaper, because he editorialised:Any politician who believes that they have to regain people's trust is on the right track.I think there are a lot of farmers out there who might regain just a little bit of trust in the ALP if the Leader of the Opposition did the honourable thing and renegotiated that lease to something that was fair and reasonable.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am very well aware of his keen interest in this issue. Everyone agrees that land clearing in Queensland needs to be better managed and controlled. Indeed, the federal government has taken an active interest in land clearing, especially because of its potential to make significant gains in relation to greenhouse gas reductions but also because we are interested in protecting the biodiversity and particularly the of concern vegetation. We attempted in our negotiations with the Queensland government to achieve a fair outcome for land-holders and all of those interested in land clearing. Indeed, the Australian government offered financial support - $75 million was put on the table. - But we expected that any new regime would be based soundly on science and that land-holders would be consulted and treated fairly in that whole process. It is clear, however, that the Queensland government were never genuine in their discussions with the Australian government or with the land-holders. The Queensland government have refused to cooperate with industry bodies who are seeking to develop workable land-clearing regimes and have even refused to make available information that was essential to enable various options to be properly considered. In many instances the Queensland government denied that information was even available. There has been a complete unwillingness to cooperate with land-holders and others who are interested in this important process.During the Queensland election, the Premier declared that the Queensland government would go it alone and provide $150 million assistance to land-holders affected by their decision. Rather than talk with the relevant stakeholders, the Queensland government have decided that they are going to act unilaterally and without the support of the Australian government. Yesterday the Queensland government called in the farm industry organisations and told them that they will be introducing their legislation on 18 March to end all land clearing by 2006.The Queensland government made it quite clear in those discussions that the content of their legislation is not negotiable. They will not involve regional communities in determining where clearing is appropriate, they will not consult with farmers and they will not consult with the Australian government. If the Queensland government insist on taking unilateral decisions then they must accept the responsibility and the financial consequences of those decisions.The New South Wales government was able to negotiate with conservationists and land-holders to achieve an acceptable land-clearing arrangement. In contrast, the Queensland government have locked out key stakeholders, including of course the federal government. On past performance, Queensland land-holders can expect to see very little of the $150 million that Premier Beattie is promising. Just ask the sugar growers -  - and ask the fishermen and the drought-stricken farmers -  - how much they actually get from the sorts of promises that the Beattie government offer in these circumstances. This is a sad decision, particularly for many of the regional communities in electorates like that of the honourable member for Maranoa, whose hopes and aspirations have been dashed as a result of this determination, this confrontational approach of the Queensland government. The decision has been taken without regard to science, without properly considering the needs of the land-holders and without proper consultation with the Australian government - and it will not therefore have our financial support.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin not only for the question but also for her commitment to Work for the Dole and her support of three projects in Makin that have been recognised and nominated for the Prime Minister's Work for the Dole awards, which will be given later this year. This is a good opportunity for me to inform the House that there have been more than 350 nominations for the Prime Minister's Work for the Dole awards from right around Australia. That is a record number of individuals recognising efforts by our fellow Australians in building better communities, which is what Work for the Dole is all about. I should remind those in the chamber that they have until Friday if they still want to nominate someone. Frank is nodding his head. It is not too late, mate, if you want to get another one in this year. He is a man who understands and recognises good quality projects.The Work for the Dole program has provided 40,000 man-years of valuable work experience with 15,000 community projects through which one-quarter of a million Australians have added to their work experience and added to the benefit to their communities. Someone would look at that and say, `How could anyone possibly be opposed to it?' Those that sit opposite are absolutely opposed to Work for the Dole. I do not think it is going too far to say that they hate the concept of Work for the Dole. We know how the member for Grayndler feels. He has been on the record many times saying that the Work for the Dole program is a blatant discriminatory attack and that this government is all about punishment and discrimination. He thinks it is punishment and discrimination to give people an opportunity to build on their work experience and do something positive in their community.He has some very good supporters on that side. You only have to look at the new leader of the Labor Party - that is, the President of the Labor Party, the member for Fremantle - who has said she finds that the idea that those who are out of work should be compelled to work for the dole to repay society for giving them something is insulting and destructive. She finds it insulting and destructive that someone should have to repay the benefit they are receiving from society. Those on this side of the House say that getting people out of their houses and getting them involved in worthwhile work in their communities is in fact very positive and constructive. Again we have the Leader of the Opposition in direct conflict with the President of the Labor Party and his shadow minister, but there is nothing new about that.The member for Grayndler has admitted that he would not be keeping Work for the Dole in its current form. If you do not call it Work for the Dole and if it does not look like Work for the Dole then it simply is not Work for the Dole. Therefore we would see this wonderful work experience program destroyed by those who sit opposite. Every one of the members that sit on this side of the House is committed to Work for the Dole and what it stands for. Work for the Dole is about giving people a hand. It is about giving people a fair go, not a free ride. The Labor Party wants to repudiate the notion that with rights come responsibilities. This side of the House remains committed to Work for the Dole.</DOC>

 - I will have to consult the Minister for Defence, who of course has ministerial responsibility. I will not presume to try and answer with the detail - because I do not know it - without checking the facts. But the member has obviously raised an issue, and I am very happy to investigate it. Let me make a couple of observations. It is my understanding that there are planes which sometimes carry a number of cabinet ministers from Melbourne at the beginning of a week. I do not think there is anything unreasonable in that. I also understand that on occasions - and I could be wrong - there are Perth and Adelaide specials which carry members on both sides of the parliament.The opposition has decided to raise this matter. The opposition having raised it, I will see that it is fully investigated. But I want to make the point that over a number of years and under governments of both political persuasions there has been a reasonable understanding that in proper circumstances special purpose, or VIP, aircraft should be available. Recently the Leader of the Opposition - as was his right - requested permission from me to take a special purpose aircraft to Papua New Guinea. I readily agreed with that. -  - No, hang on; let us be fair. Can I just say -  - Let me be fair to the Leader of the Opposition. I did not ask my staff to seek an explanation from the Leader of the Opposition - and I remember these circumstances very clearly - as to whether there was a commercial flight available. If I had enforced the rules strictly, I would have said, `No, you get a commercial flight to Papua New Guinea.' But out of courtesy to the position that the Leader of the Opposition holds in this place, I immediately said to my staff, `Say yes; he can take a special purpose aircraft to go to New Guinea,' and I instructed my staff accordingly.All I can say to the Leader of the Opposition is: you have started this. I will investigate the situation very closely. I believe that VIP aircraft should be available for proper use. I have never sought in the past to use this issue against members on the other side of the parliament, but seeing that the opposition has decided to get into this business I will investigate it. If the Leader of the Opposition wants the rules enforced more rigorously, as a consequence of allowing the member for Rankin to ask this question, that could well have consequences for the opposition.</DOC>

 - I very much thank the member for Petrie for her question, but it might almost have gone to the minister for resources because, thanks to the great rent rort, the Labor Party got the goldmine and taxpayers got the shaft. That is what has happened consistently for the last 10 years, thanks to the great rent rort. The Leader of the Opposition likes to go around the country talking about the housing commission house he once lived in. What about Centenary House which now funds him? He is very concerned about golf courses and things which benefit other people. What about the Centenary House rent rort which directly benefits him?Just so that the facts of the rent rort are crystal clear: the commercial tenant in Centenary House is paying $314 a square metre, but the Labor Party is getting $871 per square metre directly from the taxpayer and it is going up nine per cent every year, guaranteed. The Leader of the Opposition talks about ethical standards, but he is not too ethical to take the money. And just how much is the money? - I am talking about the rivers of gold flowing every year into the coffers of the Australian Labor Party. In 2004 the Labor Party gets $3.9 million above market rent; in 2005, $4.4 million above market rent; in 2006, $4.9 million above market rent; and, in 2007, $5.5 million above market rent. That is 18 million reasons never to vote for the Leader of the Opposition, because this money is flowing straight into the Labor Party's coffers. It is not money in alleged maladministration; it is money straight into the Labor Party's coffers. That $4 million a year could do a lot of good in the hands of taxpayers. It could do a lot of good spent on their behalf: we could have 10,000 MRIs, 160,000 GP consultations or 374,000 flu vaccinations. But in the hands of the Labor Party just imagine what that $4 million a year is going to pay for.We might have a full-page ad in the Daily Telegraph every second day for a whole year. They could call every voter in this country, not once but twice, with that $4 million. They could send a letter to everyone who voted in the 2001 election. Every day that the rent rort continues, the Australian people know that the Leader of the Opposition would rather spend money buying one million corflutes of himself than buying 180 new aged care places. But it just gets worse. Think how many of Mem Fox's books could be bought with that $4 million - 25,000 copies.But there is an options clause - and I am indebted to the member for Mackellar for this - in the lease which means that the rent rort can continue for a further five years. Another $38 million above market rent could go straight into the coffers of the Labor Party by 2012. Why wouldn't a future Labor government want this lease renewed, given that they think it is such a good deal? It is so fair, so above board, so perfectly legitimate - why wouldn't they want the lease renewed? So I have a very serious request to make of the Leader of the Opposition on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia: give now a clear, categorical, unambiguous undertaking that a future Labor government will not exercise the option. When he gives that undertaking, because he can hardly avoid it - he knows it is a rip-off - he should then do the right thing and end the whole rent rort.</DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member's question, the issues associated with the import risk assessment for apples have generally been the subject of on-the-record examination over a period of a couple of years, so the industry has had access to all of the documents that have been associated with developing the science that the expert panel has been using. In the handbook there is a standard 60-day period for a response to those particular issues. The industry, I hope, will put effort into developing an appropriate scientific response, and that ought to be their priority, rather than advertising campaigns and other things which might divert resources from what are the key issues to be resolved in settling these matters. The handbook demonstrates that there is 60-day period; if there is to be an extension then that would be a matter for the Director of Quarantine. I have indicated to the industry that if they want to put up a case that there should be some sort of extension then that will be considered, but I think it is unreasonable of the industry to suggest that they have been in any way ambushed by the content of the documents.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question and for his long-term and ongoing support for small business in particular in his electorate of Fadden. This morning I noticed a headline in the Age newspaper in Melbourne which asked a very significant question, namely: `Will Latham be bad for business?' The answer is a resounding yes. In this article, the Labor spokesman for workplace relations, the member for Rankin, said:We'd - that is, the Labor Party - have a light-touch regulation ...`Light-touch' is one way of describing it when the union bosses hold the power, having got repayment for the $40 million that they have donated to the Australian Labor Party over the last seven to eight years. This in fact is heavy-handed regulation that the Labor Party propose which would regulate every minute of every day of every worker in Australia.Let me give some examples to the House of Labor's heavy-handed approach to industrial regulation. Labor's heavy-handed approach would give the union bosses a foot in the door of every workplace in Australia, whether or not there was a union member employed within that workplace - something which is in legislation before the Labor state government in South Australia at the present time. Labor's heavy-handed approach would require businesses to bargain with the union bosses regardless of their interest in talking directly with their workers. Labor's heavy-handed approach would give $3.8 billion in government contracts only to the small and medium sized businesses in Australia which the union bosses approved of, something which was part of ALP policy just a month ago in Sydney.Labor's heavy-handed approach would remove flexibility and choice in the Australian work force by the abolition of Australian workplace agreements, of which in the order of 400,000 have been taken up to date - the fastest growing industrial instrument at the present time. Labor's heavy-handed approach would remove the secondary boycott provisions from the Trade Practices Act which protect small business from sympathy strikes. Labor's heavy-handed approach would also reconstitute industry-wide agreements, so we would have a return to this: 500-page, complex, complicated awards, industry wide, regulating, as I said, every minute of every day of every worker in Australia. In fact what the Labor Party want to do is to turn back the clock so far as the system in Australia is concerned so that it is written by industrial lawyers for industrial lawyers and the union bosses. If this is a `light-touch approach', it is a bit like the light touch the Leader of the Opposition has with taxi drivers.The CEO of the Australian Industry Group, Heather Ridout, in this article this morning, said:Latham's regulatory industrial relations policies are at odds with his free market economics ...That is the judgment of business in Australia. As I said yesterday, in a letter the Combined Small Business Alliance of Western Australia said of an ALP federal government:Small business should be afraid, very afraid.I invited the Leader of the Opposition to release the letter yesterday. He has not done so. I table it for the benefit of the House. The conclusion from business is quite clear: Labor is bad for jobs, Labor is bad for workers, Labor is bad for business and Labor is bad for Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The key problem in relation to health delivery in rural and regional Australia is, frankly, a shortage of doctors and specialists. As a matter of fact, the Leader of the Opposition knows this. I am indebted to that august journal, the Northern Daily Leader, for telling me this. The Northern Daily Leader tells me a great deal more about Labor Party policy than do the Labor Party's policy statements and web sites. The Leader of the Opposition was in the New England region recently and he learned that, in an attempt to attract the doctors and specialists that are needed in country areas, some country communities are going to great lengths - including building surgeries, providing houses and so forth - in an attempt to induce people to come to their areas. The Leader of the Opposition expressed surprise at this - he had not heard of it - and, in casting around for a solution, he came up with one. He said: `Bringing them in from overseas is probably not such a good idea. I know what we ought to be doing: we ought to be training more of them.'We have known for decades that the key to having sufficient doctors, nurses and specialists in rural areas is to train enough country kids in medicine; that is how you get them. We have known for years that, to get the supply of doctors that is needed in country areas, you have to make certain that the medical intake of country kids is around 25 per cent. But when the Labor Party left office in 1996, the intake of country kids into our medical schools in Australia stood at eight per cent. We need 25 per cent. Thanks to the government's specific measures, it is now over 25 per cent.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. I indicated to the Australian public, when the committee report was tabled on Monday, that the government would accept the recommendations in relation to an inquiry. I am now able to announce that the government has appointed Mr Philip Flood, a former departmental secretary and a former Director-General of the Office of National Assessments. In fact, he was appointed to that position by my predecessor, Mr Keating. Mr Flood has been asked to report on the matters recommended in the parliamentary report itself. I can inform the House that I have asked Mr Flood to report to the government by 30 June this year. I will table a copy of my letter to Mr Flood and also the short press statement that I have issued in relation to his appointment.I take this opportunity to strongly reaffirm the government's support for Australia's intelligence agencies. In the time that I have been Prime Minister, I have had a great deal of advice from our intelligence agencies. Like all agencies of that kind, they operate under very great pressure. They are crucial to the fight against terrorism. It behoves everybody on this side of the House - and, indeed, on the other side of the House - to respect and support the intelligence agencies in the vital work that they do on behalf of the Australian people. In an age of having to cope with terrorism, nothing is more important than timely, professional intelligence.As far as the government is concerned, Mr Flood will be invited, as the terms of reference suggest, to examine the matters recommended by the committee. Ministers will be available to speak to Mr Flood, if that is his wish. I remind the parliament that he is not only a former Director-General of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau, a former Director-General of ONA and a former Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but also a former Ambassador to Indonesia and a former High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. In other words, he is a person who is eminently qualified and who has served, with distinction, both sides of this parliament during his professional career. I am certain that he will carry out the task in a very effective way and one which will build further support and confidence in Australia's intelligence services. But let me finish by saying again that the intelligence agencies of this country are entitled to support from both sides of this parliament - and I hope they receive it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question. My attention has been drawn to some remarks made by the New South Wales Premier following the release of the latest report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission on relativities. Rather than attach my own description to what the Premier said, let me draw on some words from Professor Ken Wiltshire, a graduate of the London School of Economics, who is a member of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. He said that the Premier of New South Wales is being `irrational' in the comments that he has made. Professor Wiltshire said:They don't miss out, everybody gains. This is the GST revenue and health grants revenue and it increases every year.So NSW will be getting a lot of extra money this year. It just won't be relatively getting perhaps as much as some of the other states.Let me remind the House that the Commonwealth Grants Commission, which was established in 1933, is designed to help achieve an objective that I would hope everybody in this parliament shares, and that is the equality of services for all Australians, irrespective of where they live. Frankly, that goal transcends any kind of state parochialism or any kind of state borders.I notice that the Premier of New South Wales said that his disappointed expectations were entirely due to the fact that the federal government have ripped money out of New South Wales. The truth is that, if the Premier of New South Wales has a complaint, he ought to take up that complaint with each of his state and territory Labor colleagues. What has happened is that the Grants Commission, the independent umpire, which is not influenced by the federal government and is operating according to a charter that has been accepted more or less in the same form since 1933, has determined some new relativities. But the interesting thing is that if you apply the new Grants Commission relativities to the latest estimates of GST revenue and health care funding this is what you find in relation to each of the states: New South Wales receives $244 million more in the coming year; Victoria, $371 million more; Queensland, $735 million more; Western Australia, $453 million more; South Australia, $131 million more; Tasmania, $20 million more; the ACT, $20 million more; and the Northern Territory, $36 million more. What that indicates is something that this government has asserted, and which of course is the reality: since the introduction of the GST the states and territories are all better off. They have never had it so good as far as revenue is concerned. They are rolling in money, courtesy of a reform that was introduced by this government in the teeth of the hostility and the opposition of the Australian Labor Party.I would say to the New South Wales Premier: if you have a complaint, instead of trying to create a diversion from the way in which your rail system and your health system are collapsing around your ears, you ought to be hopping on a plane or perhaps motoring down and getting your mate from Victoria, going over to Western Australia and then going up to Queensland and saying: `Hey, Geoff, hey, Peter, will you please give us a dollar? We need it.' He does not have a complaint. We have provided all of them with more money. If they want to have a squabble about how to divide up the cake, let them go away from the federal government and have their own little argument in some kind of political enclave. We provide the cake. It is a bigger cake. It is up to them to agree on how to slice it up.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question and recognise his involvement in and support of our negotiations for the free trade agreement with America and his recognition of the benefits that will accrue to exporters in his electorate. I am pleased today to be able to table the legal text of the Australia-US free trade agreement in the House and to be able to inform the House that the full text is available on the DFAT web site: www.dfat.gov.au - for the benefit of members opposite if they want to go to that web site and download what is almost 1,000 pages of an outstanding agreement.As of today, the Australian public will have the opportunity to review this groundbreaking agreement. The Australian public will be able to see for themselves that this is a good agreement for Australia and one in the national interest. The Australian public will also be able to see that, so far, the Australian Labor Party have been playing politics with what is a good agreement and one in the national interest. The text will be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties for parliamentary and public scrutiny. JSCOT will provide a direct avenue for the public and parliament to make known their views on the FTA. There will be public hearings in all states and territories to afford that opportunity.It was interesting to note yesterday some comments from a prominent Labour leader who supports this agreement and supports what we have done and what we have achieved here. I was pleased to hear that there is a prominent Labour leader who sees the merit of linking our economy with the largest and most dynamic economy in the world. Unfortunately, it is not the member for Werriwa - the leader of the Labor Party and Leader of the Opposition in this place. It was in fact the Prime Minister of New Zealand on her visit here yesterday, when she said:We each have our own FTA priorities running and I congratulate you again on your success, particularly in the presidential election year in the US with the agreement with that great economy.We need to ask: how come the Prime Minister of, and leader of the Labour Party in, New Zealand can recognise the benefit and merit of this agreement for the Australian economy, yet the Australian Labor Party cannot?</DOC>

 - The answer to the opposition health spokeswoman's question is yes. I have seen public comments by her today, and I should make a couple of points on this matter. There is a provision in the side letter of the free trade agreement that states that Australia will provide an opportunity for adjustments to the price of pharmaceuticals. This reflects current practice. It is the status quo. There has also been speculation that the review process contained in the free trade agreement will be linked to price reviews and increases. This is incorrect. The review process will only consider PBAC recommendations not to list a drug on the PBS, and not the price of the pharmaceuticals on the PBS.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and I know that the constituents of Grey, an electorate very close to my own, are very excited about the enormous benefits they are going to gain from the free trade agreement with the United States. It is also nice to have in the gallery the former Ambassador to the United States, Andrew Peacock, because he was one of the people who did so much work to build the foundations for this agreement, and I think the House should be grateful to him for the good work he did.The Minister for Trade has tabled today the full text of the agreement. Obviously, there are enormous benefits in this agreement for Australia, such as immediate duty-free access for over 97 per cent of our merchandise exports, and legal protection for services, trade and Australian investment in the United States so that our firms can compete on equal terms with American firms in the world's biggest services economy. There is open access for Australian companies to bid in the $200 billion market for federal government procurement in the United States. This is an enormously beneficial agreement to Australian business and to Australian industry. It also means, importantly, that we are able to compete in the United States market with countries that also have free trade agreements with the United States - for example, Canada, Mexico and Chile - on a basis that we could never have if we did not have such an agreement.This complements the free trade agreements that we have with Singapore and New Zealand and the incoming free trade agreement with Thailand. They are all part of a web of the strategic bilateral and regional linkages which are enhancing our economic opportunities as a country. Frankly, I think that these links add to the environment of international peace and stability. The honourable member asked me if there were other views. There used not to be. For example, the member for Member for Fraser, when he was the Minister for Trade, wrote an article for the Australian newspaper in which he said:Preferential trade agreement arrangements are not just a fetish of the 1990s, they are here to say. They reflect the globalisation and deeper integration of international commerce.He was a supporter of free trade agreements when he was the Minister for Trade. Now he joins a list of those who are clearly opposing a free trade agreement with the United States. So, too, was the person who said in parliament in 1999 on 20 September:We have alliances and shared interests in key parts of the Asia Pacific ... Our foreign policy needs to further integrate these interests. This is best achieved through free trade and investment.He went on to say - ... shared economic interests are the best defence of Australia's strategic interests. This strengthens the case for a free trade agreement between Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, the United States and Canada...That was the member for Werriwa, the now Leader of the Opposition. So in 1999 he was a great fan of a free trade agreement with the United States; in 2004, he has become an opponent of a free trade agreement with the United States - though in the last a few days he said he was not really quite so sure. But I notice from the questions and comments of Labor's spokespeople today that it is pretty clear that they still remain opposed to the agreement. It is part of a pattern under the Leader of the Opposition. They have no idea what direction they are heading in.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can assure him that the FTA will not compromise Australia's quarantine regime. Australia's right to protect animal, plant and human health and life is fully preserved under the FTA. As a part of the agreement, both Australia and the United States have reaffirmed that decisions on matters affecting quarantine and food safety will be based on science. Those decisions will be taken by the two relevant organisations within the two countries: Biosecurity Australia and APHIS in the United States.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Ryan for his question. The Australian Bureau of Statistics today released their house price index, showing that established house prices increased by six per cent in the December quarter, with price rises recorded in all capital cities, and Brisbane recording the strongest growth. No doubt some of that would be in the Ryan electorate, from what I know of that electorate. The ABS noted, though, that the number of transactions of properties at the middle to upper end of the market increased in the December quarter, inflating the recorded growth. So it could well be that you had a great deal of movement at the upper end, which moved the overall index. House prices have been supported by strong employment growth, strong consumer sentiment and low interest rates for the last six to eight years.But, looking at more forward indicators, building approvals for the month of January came out today showing that building approvals fell by 3.3 per cent - the fourth consecutive monthly decline - with the total number of building approvals in January being 12.3 per cent lower than they were four months ago. This reflected a 5.6 per cent fall in building approvals for houses. This is consistent with other forward indicators which show a slowing in relation to the housing market. Housing finance for occupiers declined 0.8 per cent in December and 3.9 per cent in November. Investors are also withdrawing from the market, with total investor housing finance falling 5.6 per cent in November and four per cent in December. And there are reports that auction clearing rates are lower than they were at this time last year.These forward indicators indicate that there is a slowing in the housing market going on. The government has forecast a slowing in its budget forecasts. We would expect that that slowing is consistent with the housing market plateauing. After the strong rises that we have seen over recent years, a plateauing in the housing market may not be an altogether bad thing.</DOC>

 - I think the GPs of Bendigo are out of step with the GPs in other parts of Australia, because the Australian Divisions of General Practice warmly welcomed the MedicarePlus package. The MedicarePlus package will inject more money into general practice. There is $1 billion worth of increased income for general practitioners. We also inject $1 billion into improving the work force. So I very much reject the assertion that was put to me by the member for Bendigo.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question. My mind goes back to his election. I think it was 14 July 2001 - a day of great of importance. The French Revolution, the fall of the Bastille and Chris Pearce in Aston - all on 14 July. I can inform the hero of Aston that the government has set aside $445 million as its portion, together with the Victorian government, to build the Scoresby Freeway. Sixty-three million dollars was set aside this financial year, $63 million next, $50 million in 2005-06, $87 million in 2006-07 and $155.9 million in 2007-08 so that the Scoresby Freeway could be finished on time and on budget for the people of the outer eastern suburbs and finished on time and on budget in accordance with the `Scoresby transport corridor: Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the government of Victoria' which, at clause 3(d), says:Victoria undertakes to ensure users of the Scoresby Freeway will not be required to pay a direct toll.I am doing a breakfast in the Aston electorate tomorrow with the member for Pearce, and I have given great thought to the topic of my talk. The topic of my talk tomorrow is: what part of the word `freeway' do you not understand? The word `freeway' is made up of `free' and `way'. Either the Bracks government does not understand `way' or it does not understand `free'. A letter was sent out by Mr Bracks before the 2002 election. I think I really should table this. It is something that tells you all about the Labor Party: `Bracks listens and acts.' Before the Victorian election, this letter was signed by Steve Bracks and sent to the electors of the outer east of Melbourne. It says: `Labor will build the Scoresby Freeway on time and on budget. These are not just election time promises, they are my firm commitments to you and your family and they will be honoured.' All the citizens of the outer east of Melbourne want to do is climb the ladder of opportunity, and they find there is a toll on the ladder as they are going up. The toll has been put there by the Australian Labor Party. Steve Bracks listened and he acted.My attendance at the breakfast tomorrow will be nothing on the breakfast down at the Bayswater Hotel, 780 Mountain Highway, Bayswater. There are only 21 sleeps to go. The Australian Labor Party will be having its breakfast under the heading `Tolls are good: prove us wrong'. Minister for transport Peter Batchelor will be there. He is also be talking on these topics: how tolls are good, how drought is good for farmers, how unions are good for business and how Labor is good for economic management.I do want to say that there is one member of the Labor frontbench who has some integrity. He knows who he is. He is smiling. He knows what is coming. I could well have killed his career today. There is one Labor member who has a conscience. He is the member for Batman - it is true. The member for Batman told his Victorian colleagues, as reported by the Sunday Age, that he would not be doing a Bracks government in relation to the Geelong Road. He is nodding in agreement. No-one would ever want to be accused of doing a Bracks government, would they? Mr Ferguson told the Geelong Advertiser, `It is about time all politicians were honest with the electorate', referring to the Bracks government's 2002 election promise not to bring in tolls.We say to the member for Batman: you had the courage to stand up to the Bracks government, which we endorse. What worries me about all of this is that Martin Ferguson is one of the few among so many. There are so many on the Labor front bench who maintain their silence when it comes to the Scoresby Freeway. There is no greater silence than that of the member for Werriwa, who went to the outer east of Melbourne. He was asked whether or not federal Labor would build the Scoresby Freeway, and he was not able to answer the question. He said it was a state matter. He said $445 million of Commonwealth money and a signed agreement - a pledge - were just a state matter.We say to the Bracks government: listen and act. We say to the member for Werriwa: have the courage of your convictions like the member for Batman. We say to Peter Batchelor: you are going to have a great meeting down there telling people how good tolls are when they were promised a freeway. I want to finish by saying that the Scoresby freeway land was set aside for the building of a freeway in 1961. It has been in the Melways directory ever since. Nineteen sixty-one was the year of the birth of the member for Werriwa. Wouldn't it be a present if he could stand up for those people climbing the ladder of opportunity in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne? What part of the word `freeway' don't you understand?</DOC>

 - I am not going to deny that bulk-billing rates have fallen. They have fallen modestly. But two out of three GP consultations are bulk-billed. Under the MedicarePlus package, $2.4 billion is being invested in further strengthening and protecting Medicare, including $1 billion for doctors' incomes; the $5 bulk-billing incentive for children and concession card holders; and $1 billion for work force measures to ensure that by 2007 we have 1,500 extra GPs and 1,600 extra nurses in general practice.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. As the House will be aware, the Howard government has already allocated almost $1 billion to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and as a result we are now on track to reach our internationally negotiated target. We have done this - and this is the important thing - without imposing excessive additional costs on Australian industry. We put in place a strategy that will preserve Australian jobs and at the same time move us towards our greenhouse gas reduction target. There is an alternative view being outlined. That is the view of the Labor Party, which wants to commit Australia to ratifying the flawed Kyoto protocol - a treaty that is not in Australia's national interests and that will impose all kinds of unnecessary costs on our industries, which will destroy jobs and drive investment offshore. The Leader of the Opposition was actually the spokesperson for several alternative views on the Kyoto protocol. To give him his due, in the Canberra Times on Saturday he admitted that when it comes to leadership he has not turned his mind to the environment. This, of course, has not stopped him from talking about the Kyoto protocol. During the Cunningham by-election two years ago he told the voters in very definite terms, `You would be endorsing a Green candidate who wants to reduce greenhouse gases by 60 per cent, which would wipe out whole industries and cause the closure of BHP in the Illawarra.' In the same radio interview, he said, `I think to reduce it by 60 per cent, that's just an extremist policy.' That is now the policy of the Australian Labor Party, characterised by the Leader of the Opposition as an extremist policy. Fast-forward to Monday morning this week, when the Leader of the Opposition woke up with that glow only honeymooners have and appeared on ABC Central Queensland radio. He tried to convince the listeners in Gladstone, who are constituents of the member for Hinkler, that not only would the Kyoto protocol be good for them - this is a town where there is great dependence on the aluminium and alumina industries: high energy users - but that the domestic carbon trading system that he was advocating would also be good for them. That is just like telling them that two broken arms are better than one, because both of those would deliver a double whammy to the people of Gladstone. The member for Werriwa needs to understand that a carbon trading system imposes costs, especially on heavy energy users. The industries there are export based. Under Labor they would simply become basket cases.  - Australia is on track to reach its target without these job destroying policies, and they do not need the policies of the Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition. I do not want to imply that I am charging the Leader of the Opposition with consistency on this matter. He is not consistent and I would not want to misrepresent him. A fortnight ago at the National Press Club he took a different view about environmental policy. Then he said: But my starting point's obviously that I want to do things that are helpful in protecting Australia's natural environment. But the other compelling starting point, and this really is for me the origin of my perspective, you can't hurt working class communities by wiping out jobs. Yet that is precisely what the policies he was advocating when he went to Gladstone would do. So where does the member for Werriwa's heart really lie? With the Europeans and Kyoto or with working-class Australians who have jobs? This is a man professing true love to one and flirting with another - a man who is still on his honeymoon and yet he is cheating with somebody else.</DOC>

 - Can I say I cannot recall any occasion when the council has been overruled, and that is for this reason: the competition agreement was signed by all of the states and the Commonwealth. The states did not trust the Commonwealth in relation to allocating payments to them, so they insisted that there be an independent council. The independent council is the National Competition Council, and the people appointed to that council are appointed on the votes of a majority of the states. The Commonwealth does not even have a vote. The people that make the decision are appointed by a majority vote of the states. It is just like the ACCC.  - Mr Speaker, you will recall the difficulty we went through in relation to the chairman of the ACCC, where the states were in deadlock: the Commonwealth did not even have a vote. The National Competition Council is the same. In fact, the chairman of the National Competition Council is Dr Wendy Craik, the former executive director of the National Farmers Federation and somebody who, I think, would know the situation in rural Australia quite well.While I am on my feet: I noticed that one of the state premiers, Premier Carr, in attacking the Commonwealth Grants Commission yesterday, said very colourful things about the members of the Commonwealth Grants Commission - this is different to the National Competition Council, of course. He called them a little `priesthood of economists' in Canberra. He said, `I can't believe that we've got retired bureaucrats, the former Mayor of Woollahra, a few minor academics in a grant commission in candlelight picking over obscure formulas.' The Prime Minister has made the point that Professor Ken Wiltshire, described as a `minor academic', is a graduate of the London School of Economics. Can I just add that I did check, and the former Mayor of Woollahra who is on the Commonwealth Grants Commission, Hylda Rolfe, was recommended for appointment to the Commonwealth Grants Commission by the New South Wales Treasury.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. I know how concerned she is about this issue, and I should acknowledge that South Australia actually does better in this area than any other state of Australia. Let me make the point that in a quite literal sense organ donation can mean that early death need not be just a waste. I regret to say that, while Australia has the world's best record in organ transplantation, we have the world's worst record in organ donation. In 2002, 107 people died on the organ donor waiting list. In 2003, 140 people died on the organ donor waiting list. There are currently 2,000 people waiting for donor organs. Those people deserve the chance to have a new start in life, but they will only get that if we get our organ donation rates up. At present Australia's organ donation rate is just 9.4 donations per million people; that compares to 13 in the United Kingdom, 22 in the United States and 34 in Spain.Last week was Organ Donor Awareness Week. I am pleased to say that 5,000 people joined the Organ Donor Register last week. That is up from just 250 in an average week. Unfortunately, there are still 15 million Australians who are not on the Organ Donor Register. Then there is the problem of ensuring that relatives give consent. I am working with the states now to try to ensure that people's wishes about organ donation are more consistently respected.I should point out to the House that, thanks to David Hookes's family's respect for his wish to be an organ donor, 10 people have been given the gift of life. I should also point out to the House the good work that is now being done in David Hookes's memory by the David Hookes Foundation, which is waging a continuous campaign to get more Australians to sign up as organ donors under the slogan `Sign up to save a life'. I commend that to all members and, through all members, to every Australian.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. This is an example of how the accreditation system that was introduced by the Howard government in 1996-97 is working. Practices that result in poor care are never acceptable. But under Labor, when there was no national quality assessment at all, these sorts of incidents would not have come to light. As for the home in question, the department has imposed sanctions on the approved provider of Chelsea Private Nursing Home.The accreditation agency, an agency that was put in place by this government to ensure that there was quality of care across the nursing home sector subsidised by the Commonwealth government, conducted a number of support contacts and reviews. The department has kept all residents informed and from time to time the department has attended meetings conducted by the approved provider to ensure that residents and their families are aware of the action being taken by the approved provider to address the issues that have been brought to their attention. The agency has continued to undertake reviews and contacts. During the week of 23 February the agency made another visit to ensure that progress was being made in addressing the areas of noncompliance. The home's accreditation period has also been looked at.I can assure all members that the department and the agency will continue to monitor the services provided by all aged care facilities that are subsidised by the federal government, for the care and safety of all residents in these homes remains our top priority. But, of course, under Labor there was no national quality assessment at all of aged care homes. All that happened was that the Labor government gave aged care a bad name in this country. What the Howard government has done is ensure that there is quality, that there are high standards, that there is equity in access and that the care provided to all Australians is the care they need and the care they deserve.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question and for standing up for the 70 per cent of kids who do not go directly from school to university and who instead go into apprenticeships and training as much as he does for the 30 per cent who do. The government last year passed groundbreaking reforms to Australian universities. The reforms include an additional $2.6 billion of extra public money, as a minimum, for universities in the first five years alone, including 34,000 extra HECS places - including some for the University of Newcastle - regional loading for regional campuses and universities, scholarships for students and access to performance based funding pools.I am also asked about other policies. The Labor Party, after the release of the government's own reform program for universities, released its own policy. It was entitled Aim Higher, which is basically the only thing which it chose to take from the Blair government. The Labor Party's policy was costed, at least from its point of view, at about $2.4 billion. So the Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training and the Department of Finance and Administration both carefully analysed the Labor Party's costings of its higher education policy. Firstly, there is a $470 million tax on mining companies in Australia. Apparently the Labor Party believes that workers in the mining industry should lose their jobs so people training to be lawyers and dentists do not have to pay $1,600 back on their HECS. The Labor Party also said that it would fund $160 million by abolishing tax incentives for foreign workers. In fact, that is a program that does not even exist. The department of finance and the department of education have both pointed out that that particular initiative and that $160 million do not even exist.The Leader of the Opposition told Alan Jones on 30 January on Radio 2GB in Sydney that one of the ways Labor would fund its education policy would be to reintroduce a loans scheme that this government has just scrapped. Work this out: it would save $160 million by running a loans scheme to some of the poorest students in the country that is sending both them and the Australian taxpayer broke. The Leader of the Opposition could not even explain it to Alan Jones, let alone to his own caucus. In addition to that, the department of finance costed any reduction in HECS for 84,000 science and maths students at $262 million. The Labor Party budgets $43 million. So there is a $219 million black hole, not just according to me, not just according to the government but according to the federal department of finance. What the department of finance said was, `When we looked for the money, it was not there at all.' I thought to myself: I have heard that before somewhere.Where is the Labor Party's economic logic coming from? The Leader of the Opposition is obviously trying to send us a message in relation to economic management and is exhorting us all to read to our children - and we would all naturally agree with that. We have a $540 million black hole in Labor's education costings according to the department of finance. Then I thought: `It's magic. That's how they do it. It's absolute magic.' In fact, it is Possum Magic. When the department of finance said that they could not find it all, I thought I had read that before somewhere. So I went to page 15 of Possum Magic, which I highly commend to the House and to all children. With apologies to Mem Fox, what you will find on page 15 is: `There was money for this and money for that; money for tall and money for small. But the money they were looking for wasn't there at all.'On a very serious note, there is no magic in it whatsoever. If you want to have an economy that is growing at four per cent it requires leadership; it requires sound economic management. If you want to make sure our kids can go from schools into jobs and if you want to make sure Australian families do not lose their houses it requires no magic; it requires leadership and solid economic management, which is what the country has.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mackellar for her question and I congratulate her on her 10-year campaign to end this scandalous rent rort - because that is exactly what it is. Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition would not say whether a future Labor government would renew the rent rort deal. He would not say whether he would end the rent rort now. According to the Labor Party web site, the Leader of the Opposition has not said anything since last Friday except for a couple of questions in this House, which have been written for him by someone else. Here he is: he is `Trappist Mark', and he is running away from questions about Centenary House because the evidence about the rent rort rip-off just mounts every day. He is happy to read stories to kids, but he will not answer questions about Centenary House.In yesterday's Financial Review, an advertisement appeared on page 4 which revealed the real leasing costs of high-quality office space in Canberra. The space in question, some 5,000 square metres not far from Centenary House, is currently let to the Australian Government Solicitor at a net rental of $290 per square metre. The building in question is called, funnily enough, Lionel Murphy House. Let me say: Lionel Murphy was not nearly as good to the Labor Party as Centenary House is. The Australian Government Solicitor is paying $290 per square metre in Lionel Murphy House. The commercial tenant is paying $314 per square metre to the Audit Office in Centenary House, but the Audit Office is paying $871 per square metre to the Labor Party in Centenary House. This is the essence of the rent rort rip-off which the Leader of the Opposition will not do anything about. It just is not going to go away. Today the Senate passed a resolution calling for a judicial inquiry to review the findings of the royal commission of inquiry into Centenary House in the light of later evidence, particularly with regard to movements and trends in commercial rates and leasing arrangements since 1994. It is interesting: the Senate passed that resolution without a division, on the voices, because members opposite were too ashamed to back the Leader of the Opposition in his scandalous defence of the Centenary House rent rort. I call on the directors of John Curtin House, I call on the people who are directly responsible for this - former Labor Premier Michael Field, former Labor minister Gerry Hand, former Labor Party national secretary Geoff Walsh and current Labor Party national secretary Tim Gartrell - to end the rip-off now. If they will not do it, if the Leader of the Opposition had any commitment at all to ethics in politics he would tell them to end the rip-off now.</DOC>

 - In response to the Leader of the Opposition, I think child-care workers, like all other workers in this country, should be fairly and properly remunerated. As to the question of the impact of salary adjustments, like all adjustments in salaries you have to take into account the rights and interests of the workers as well as the impact of those adjustments on those who employ them. But, since the Leader of the Opposition has asked me a question about child care, I take the opportunity of informing the House, on this International Women's Day, that there has been a 70 per cent increase in the money spent on child care during the years we have been in government, compared with Labor. We spent $7 billion on child care from 1996 to 2002 - that is, 70 per cent more than was spent in the last six years under Labor. There have been 200,000 additional child-care places since 1996; the total is now over 500,000. While on the generic subject of International Women's Day, I point out that, under this government, there are four million women in paid employment, which is an increase of 17.2 per cent, or more than 600,000 jobs created for women since 1996. I also remind the Leader of the Opposition that the female unemployment rate has fallen from 7.6 per cent in 1996 to six per cent now, which is an all-time low.</DOC>

 - I am pleased and ready to inform the member for Kooyong that, unlike the Leader of the Opposition, I can assure the Australian people, now, that we have no intention of introducing new taxes and no intention of increasing taxation rates. I also remind the Leader of the Opposition that the Commonwealth's tax share has decreased under this government - that the Commonwealth general government-sector cash taxation revenue, as a proportion of GDP, has fallen from 23.7 per cent in 1996 to an estimated 21 per cent in 2003-04. The share of personal income tax as a proportion of GDP -  - has also declined from 12.7 per cent of GDP in 1996 to an estimated 11.8 per cent of GDP in 2003-04. I take the opportunity of the question asked by the member for Kooyong to remind the parliament - and in particular those who sit opposite - of the various steps this government has taken not to increase tax but rather to reduce tax. There were $12 billion of personal income tax cuts delivered on 1 July 2000. - There were additional personal income tax cuts delivered on 1 July last year that were worth in excess of $10 billion over four years. There were major tax cuts for older Australians announced in the 2001 budget through the increase in the low-income aged persons rebate. A new system of family tax benefits was introduced from July 2000 which provides benefits of more than $10 billion a year to Australian families. Capital gains tax reforms have been introduced so that individuals are only taxed on half of their capital gains. The company tax rate has been reduced from 36 per cent to 30 per cent. The government introduced a measure to refund excess imputation credits, which is worth about $500 million a year to Australian taxpayers. Wholesale sales tax has been abolished. Fuel excise indexation has been abolished, and the government cut the fuel excise rate in 2001 by 1.5c a litre. Financial institutions duty was abolished in July 2001, at the time delivering savings of $1.2 billion a year to individuals and companies. Other taxes administered by the states and territories, including bed taxes and stamp duties on marketable securities, were abolished as part of a new tax system, and the bank accounts debit tax is scheduled to be abolished by all states and territories by 1 July 2005. So I can say to the member for Kooyong: not only can I give an assurance that we will not be introducing new taxes or introducing increases in existing rates; I can point to a record of tax reduction that is unparalleled by any other government over the last eight years.</DOC>

 - In reply to the Leader of the Opposition, unlike him I do not regard paid maternity leave as the one and only solution to achieving a better balance between work and family in the Australian community. I point out to the Leader of the Opposition that he voted, along with other members of the Labor Party, to deny the women of Australia the benefits of the family tax benefits system under the new taxation system that was introduced in 2000. The Leader of the Opposition was one of those who sat and cynically tried to stop taxation reform, which had, as an element, billions of dollars of additional help to Australian women, whether they chose to return to the work force, decided to be at home or decided to be at home for a while while their children were young and then re-enter the work force.The philosophy of this government is not to mandate a particular form of parental behaviour by new mothers but rather to maximise the choice that is available to them. The policy of the Leader of the Opposition appears to be entirely centred on paid maternity leave. My experience of talking to Australian women is that for as many women as you find who see paid maternity leave as being the great solution to the challenge there are probably three or four who want to see even greater choice put into the system. That is the philosophy that we bring, and that is the philosophy that we have followed over the last eight years.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Flinders for his question. I can tell him that I am now aware of plans to increase taxes after the next election. These plans started unravelling when the member for Werriwa, the Leader of the Opposition, appeared on the Sunday program. He was asked whether he would guarantee no tax increases or no new taxes if he were elected, and he said:Well, we'll wait and see if the Government can guarantee that in the next budget ...The government has guaranteed it. You have just heard the Prime Minister guarantee that there will be no new taxes, nor increases in taxes, in the next budget. So why would it be that the member for Werriwa cannot bring himself to make the same pledge? - Why would that be, Mr Speaker? An insight, I think, came from -  - The member for Werriwa, the Leader of the Opposition, declined to give the commitment which the government has given in relation to the next budget. - Every now and then one of the more policy-challenged members of the opposition frontbench lets the cat out of the bag. When being interviewed this morning, the member for Reid, following the admissions of honesty from the member for Batman which I disclosed to the House last Thursday, was asked:How can you counter the argument, though, that Labor is going to raise taxes after the election?His answer was:I think anyone who didn't say that would be either dishonest or naive.It could not be dishonesty, because we had the member for Werriwa doing his best George Washington act on Sunday about how he has never told a lie. No, Mr Speaker; he just changes his mind very frequently. The member for Reid said today, in response to the argument that Labor is going to raise taxes after the election:I think anyone who didn't say that would be either dishonest or naive.We have something like $8 billion of unfunded promises from the Australian Labor Party out there - on health, on education and on superannuation. If they are to be delivered, then the Labor Party will be raising taxes. And we know what the Labor Party's form on this is. The last time Labor were elected in this country was in 1993, and they did not have income tax promises then. They were not promises, they were - Government members - L-a-w! - The old member for Melbourne - the member for being nice to other people; the member for hugs - should not be interrupting so often. - We all need a bit of TLC from the member for Melbourne! Mr Speaker, over on the next page - and this has not been disclosed yet and may well, I think, be news to the backbench of the Australian Labor Party - of this document from 22 September 2003, we have the next mechanism for funding the tax policy: `increased use of special levies and user pays charges'. So we are going to have increased new taxes. I thought the Labor Party were actually complaining about these, yet this document turns up where they say, `They haven't been used enough - increase special levies.' When I release this, people will see that it is no idle document. The member for Werriwa is sure to say that it has nothing to do with him - it was only written to him as the shadow Treasurer on 22 September 2003. The people working on this report for the Labor Party were Geoff Carmody, Chris Richardson, John Sutton, Rob Raether and Russ Campbell. They agreed to provide this document - including the reference to increased capital gains tax and the increased use of special levies - to the Australian Labor Party around the end of February 2004. So this report must have come in the last week. This is no idle proposal; Access Economics say:We would expect our consulting fee to be $150,000.The proposal is costing $150,000, no doubt being paid by the rent from Centenary House - Centenary House funding Access Economics on a proposal to increase capital gains tax and introduce new special levies. No wonder you have to be naive or ignorant not to believe they will be increasing taxes. No wonder the member for Werriwa could not give any of his commitments on the Sunday program. Labor spells increased taxes. Don't look at what they say; look at what they are doing.</DOC>

 - I say in reply to the member for Gellibrand that I was not aware of those particular remarks but they do not surprise me, because I know that is the view of the Treasurer. It is a view that has been frequently expressed. It is also the view of every member of this government. This attempt by the member for Gellibrand -  - to suggest that, because we have decided to make the campaign better, we are in some way delaying it is absolutely absurd.  - I repeat that I regard a television campaign dealing with issues of rape and sexual violence against women that includes an exhortation that the first reaction of a victim is to go to a web site rather than to go and talk to a police officer, a priest, a family member or a friend as lacking in the fundamental necessity of commonsense. When these advertisements are run, there will be no way that the antiviolence message will be diluted or removed. I regard violence against women, in whatever form it takes, as absolutely repugnant. That has my view all of my life, and it is the view of all members of my government.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question. I know he is very concerned about the issue of people-smuggling and that he is delighted - as are other members on this side of the House - at the success of the government's policy in dealing with this problem.I think members of the House would be aware that the Customs vessel Dame Roma Mitchell - named after a great Australian - detected 15 illegal arrivals, all Indonesian nationals, at Ashmore Island on Thursday last week. This group of people were clearly the victims of an unscrupulous people-smuggler who promised to take them to Australia where they could apparently get work picking fruit in orchards. Those people are now being transported to Christmas Island on board the HMAS Warramunga. From there, they will be returned to Indonesia, either by sea or by air.My department has been in contact with the Indonesian government in Jakarta over the weekend and also with the Indonesian embassy here in Canberra. We have made it clear that these Indonesian citizens have arrived in Australia illegally, without the appropriate documentation, and they will be returned to Indonesia. This is a good example of the cooperation we have with the Indonesians. I have co-chaired with them two people-smuggling conferences in Bali. They were very successful ministerial meetings. We have worked very closely with them behind the scenes in a lot of other ways, in endeavouring to deal with the problem of people-smuggling. We have had good success.The honourable member for Mitchell asks if there is any alternative approach, and there is: the Labor Party's approach. They would tell the people smugglers that they are opposed to offshore processing, so people can be brought to Australia. Once they get close to Australia they will be able to get in, so the people smugglers will be able to deliver to their clients. The Labor Party oppose the further excision of islands and, interestingly enough, are opposed to turning boats back. In other words, people are not to be sent straight back if they try to come here illegally - they are to be landed. It sends out a very strong message to people smugglers that Australia is open for business. Yes, the Labor Party is going to buy three coast guard boats and take the Navy off the job. So the Navy will not be involved anymore; instead, three coast guard boats will replace the Royal Australian Navy. What are the coast guard boats supposed to do? Coast guard boats are supposed to bring people to Australia once they find them - if they find them. That is Labor's policy.Yesterday on the Insiders program, the opposition spokesman on immigration, the member for Perth, was asked about why the flow of illegal arrivals had dried up so dramatically. His answer is very interesting. He said:... what has occurred, Barrie - the question was asked by Barrie Cassidy - and I am pleased it has occurred, is that firstly, Saddam Hussein used to be a tyrant, now he is a prisoner of war.I thought that was a good comment from the member for Perth. I have not heard the member for Griffith make those sorts of comments, but I have heard him criticise the Australian, British and American governments. The member for Perth is not such a bad man after all, as he went on to say:The Taliban used to be supreme in Afghanistan. That no longer occurs ...Indeed; although the opposition supported the overthrow of the Taliban at the time, this government played an important role in throwing out the Taliban. I thought this was quite a good interview by the member for Perth, who said: We have also ... the Howard Government ... sat down with the Indonesian Government and entered into agreements so far as secondary movements and people smuggling is concerned - The member for Perth should vote Liberal at the next election, because he thinks the government should be - A government member - Or National. - Or National. He thinks the government -  -  - Well, certainly Liberal and possibly National. The member for Perth thinks the government have done the right thing to overthrow Saddam Hussein, the right thing to overthrow the Taliban and the right thing to work with Indonesians on the issue of people-smuggling. The ultimate point is that not only have the government done the right thing in all of those areas but, as far as people-smuggling is concerned, we have also been tough and we have got a great result.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. He is a civil engineer and has a very great interest in infrastructure. He has been a fearless advocate for the infrastructure needs of his own particular electorate. We are putting a national transport plan into place in Australia, and this will be to the great benefit of Australians now and in the future both in terms of economic outcomes and, very importantly, better environmental and amenity outcomes.We need to ensure that our planning in the future breaks away from the ad hoc planning that we have seen too much of in recent decades. To that end, we have certainly progressed a long way with rail. We are now very close to seamless interstate rail networks which link all of our capital cities with rail track that works, which can compete with road and take a great deal of stress off our roads, and do us proud both economically and, as I mentioned a moment ago, in terms of congestion and amenity. Progress with incorporating the designated interstate freight track in New South Wales into the national grid is now advanced to the point where I am quite confident that we can start spending the $872 million we have had on the table for the last two years, from about the time of the budget this year.We have actually spent, over and above all of the money that has gone to the states who are the major providers of infrastructure in Australia, some $13 billion over the eight years we have been in government. An example of what that money has achieved is on the Pacific Highway - of great interest, I know, to many people in this place, and outside it, who use it. In cooperation with the state government, in an initiative which was ours I must say, by declaring that road a RONI we have taken the dual carriageway sections of that vitally important road that links our two great eastern seaboard cities, Sydney and Brisbane - Melbourne, of course, is not quite on the east coast in the same way - from nine per cent to 32 per cent. Recently, Senator Ian Campbell and I were delighted to announce, on behalf of the government, that we would be committing a further $2 billion in the future. Of that $2 billion, $1.2 billion is for Roads to Recovery. Roads to Recovery is an extraordinarily successful program right across Australia which is wholeheartedly embraced by local government and by the people who drive on local roads. It is worth noting, on International Women's Day, that we are indebted to the Country Women's Association who first pointed out a few years ago that local roads were at the top of their agenda at that time - not so much now, because we have done so much to improve them. This is incredibly important, because roads are all about people in the country being able to access education and services, get the kids to the doctor or to school, or whatever. So we have another four years of funding for Roads to Recovery - You mention the New England Highway. I would like to assure the people of New England, in passing, that they have been persistently misled about the new Roads to Recovery program. There is no pea and thimble trick, as the member for New England claims in his newsletter. He claims that Roads to Recovery has been diminished to $840 million. It has not; it is $1.2 billion. He further claims that country motorists are going to pay for it because of the winding down of the fuel sales grant scheme which is supported by the other side. The difference is that, in 2½ years, we are going to divert the money into road funding - but not into Roads to Recovery. The Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, Senator Ian Campbell, advised that august journal the Northern Daily Leader of the facts recently. He pointed out very clearly that the FSGS money is being diverted to further roads and infrastructure for the benefit of the same people who currently get the grants. Unlike what the people of New England have been persistently misled to believe, it is a win-win situation all round.I am asked about alternative policies. Again I am indebted to that august journal the Northern Daily Leader, for telling me more about the Leader of the Opposition's policies than Labor's policy platform or policy statements do. When it comes to transport, their policies are a bit like their regional development policies. If I go to the member for Batman's web site and look for his policy prescriptions I find that, as with the Leader of the Opposition, there has been a bit of a vacant space for the last few years. There is nothing there. We really have a dearth of information about what the Labor Party think ought to be done in the area of transport and logistics - which is, after all, nine per cent of the Australian economy. There is no guide to be had. The Northern Daily Leader cannot recall that there were any musings - not in their web sites or their policy statements - apart from a brief reference to the Roads to Recovery as boondoggle by the Leader of the Opposition. So we have to go to the state Labor parties to see how they manage transport.We know how the Bracks government has managed Scoresby. We know now that when we step in to generously help with a bit of state road - as we did last year with the people of north-east New South Wales and south-east Queensland in that heavily built-up area there, namely the Tugan bypass - and we put money on the table, the two state governments cannot agree. The Premier of Queensland cannot get on the phone to his mate in New South Wales and say, `Listen, Bob: we really need to resolve this problem.' He has to come and say, `We states cannot agree. We want the Commonwealth to intervene to fix it.'Last week, we had an even finer example of the state governments, confronted with a mess of their own making on transport policy, trying to reinvent the wheel. I think we are all aware that New South Wales has a bit of a problem in the Sydney basin. It is just a bit of a problem. They are something like billions of dollars behind on the passenger transport network. The whole community is up in arms. They are on the nose, they are in trouble in the polls, so what do they do? While we are ensconced down here, they have a big party out on the M7 - the Western Sydney Orbital - and they trumpet their marvellous achievements. This is the high-water mark of Sydney's transport solutions as put forward by the Sydney based Labor government. The only problem is: it is a federal government initiative, and we are the only government putting money into it.</DOC>

 - It is true that my representative on the Wentworth preselection was Senator Heffernan. Senator Heffernan is also my continuing representative on the New South Wales executive of the Liberal Party. The member for Fraser, given his longstanding interest in matters of party administration, may be interested to know that under the constitution of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party any House of Representatives Liberal member from New South Wales is ineligible to sit on the Wentworth preselection, it being a rule of our party in New South Wales that somebody who is in the same batch of preselections cannot sit. Therefore, that left my choices as senators. Given that Senator Heffernan is my representative, I appointed him to represent me on both the Wentworth and Mitchell preselections.

 - I would like to thank the member for McPherson for her keen interest in child care. There is an ongoing good news story about what this coalition government have been doing in the area of child care. Why today? Because over 760,000 children are using some form of Commonwealth funded child care. That is an increase of 44 per cent since we came into government. That is the increase in the number of children, and there has been a 73 per cent increase in the number of Commonwealth funded child-care places since the coalition came to government in 1996.The average payment now to Australian families is about $2,000 per family through child-care benefits. I might add there was also the announcement that we made at the end of last year about a further $79.5 million down payment in three critical areas of child care - outside school hours care, family day care and playgroups. I know the member for McPherson was delighted when she received just under 400 places in outside school hours care. To name a couple of those services, there are those at Elanora, King's and St Vincent's, along with many other services in Queensland and right across Australia.The announcement we made at the end of last year was about 10,000 additional places in outside school hours care to meet that critical demand; 2,500 places in family day care, which wiped out all the unmet demand - and, of course, additional places in playgroups. That is just under $80 million on top of the $1.6 billion that we are spending on child care. I quote Robyn Monro Miller, who is here today, from the National Out of School Hours Services Association. She welcomed the news, particularly about outside school hours places, saying: ... this is ... a down payment for the future ...and that it would `give relief to many families struggling to find affordable care'. This is about playgroups as well, because only 30 per cent of Australian families actually use some type of Commonwealth funded child care, and we recognise the other 70 per cent. That is why a doubling of funding to playgroups is particularly important in giving them a choice. That is an $11 million commitment.The member for McPherson asked, `Are there any alternatives?' I have to say the alternative government has been in absolute confusion recently when it comes to child-care policies. In particular, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has been in an absolute spin about child care since the national conference. At the national conference of the ALP back in January, Cassandra Wilkinson of the New South Wales Labor Women's Forum let the cat out of the bag about a secret deal that was done between her and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - not so secret, because it was actually published in the Sydney Morning Herald. That was to provide 10 hours of free child care per week for all children below preschool age, plus a guarantee of a free year at preschool.Preschools are the responsibility of state governments. Why would you make preschool free for both rich and poor? This is estimated to cost $3 billion; a $3 billion commitment would be required for this particular proposal. But there was a nod and a wink, because they quickly removed it from the agenda. I quote Ms Wilkinson. She said:The reality is we low-balled what Jenny thought were reasonable commitments.So what is it? Is it $3 billion? Is it $4 billion? Is it $5 billion? Is it $6 billion? How on earth do you intend to pay for your child-care policies? You are either going to cut child-care benefits, increase taxes or go further into debt. There is only one government that is committed to child care in this country and that is the Howard-Anderson government.</DOC>

 - The member for Fowler asks a very good question, because this government have a very proud record when it comes to outside school hours care. When we came into government the ALP were funding 71,000 places for outside school hours care. Today, that figure is up to 240,000 places, an increase of 234 per cent. It is this government that have been funding child care, and particularly outside school hours care. I think it is terrific that out of budget last year another 10,000 places were funded, and that was warmly received by the outside school hours sector.Yes, we are continuing to look at the child-care sector. I will continue to be an advocate, because we have a very good story to tell. When it comes to the area of family day care, we have completely removed unmet demand. There are other stories. There are 2,000 new child-care services today that have been established since 1996. There has been a 73 per cent increase in places in child care and a 44 per cent increase in the number of kids using Commonwealth funded child care. I have to say that I am very proud of the record that this government have on child care. We will continue to advocate for the sector, whether it be in outside school hours care, long day care, community day care or any of the other myriad forms of child care.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. The member for Kalgoorlie well and truly recognises the importance of the government pursuing trade policy on two fronts - in the multilateral arena and also bilaterally. He would also be aware that we are engaged in a scoping study at the moment with China, with a view to negotiating a free trade agreement with China, which would be very important for his electorate of Kalgoorlie, particularly in the resources sector following some major announcements of deals with China recently. This follows on from our successful negotiation of a free trade agreement with the United States and the negotiation of free trade agreements with Thailand and Singapore.The latest one, with the United States, gives us an opportunity to link our economy more closely with the world's largest economy. That will obviously provide many opportunities for extra exports, extra jobs, business growth and investment, in the short term and the long term. The member for Kalgoorlie would well and truly recognise the dynamics that will be created as a result of this agreement. On top of the important market access opportunities that will be delivered up front - additional access for beef, dairy and horticulture and access for 97 per cent of our manufactured exports - the agreement will provide access to the $200 billion government procurement market in the United States. With the passage of the free trade agreement, those opportunities will be presented to the private sector in Australia to take advantage of.But so far we have seen a lot of political nitpicking from the Australian Labor Party. Its spokesman, Senator Conroy, has been drilling in to try and find little chinks - for example, 15 items in the horticulture sector. He was out at the end of last week talking about how the structure of the agreement was going to restrict our exports of automobiles. It is a classic case of the Labor Party always looking at the glass being half empty and never looking at the opportunities that are being created and the opportunities that are there to be taken advantage of.One of the most telling aspects of this is that if you look at history the Labor Party has never negotiated one of these. It has never negotiated a bilateral agreement. It has signed one. It signed a bilateral agreement with New Zealand, which was negotiated by my predecessor bar one, Doug Anthony, back in the early eighties. Since then, it has been the coalition government that has negotiated all the bilateral agreements that we have entered into - bilateral agreements which have delivered significant opportunities for the Australian economy. Our government has a very strong track record of pursuing market access opportunities, both multilaterally and bilaterally, whenever they present themselves. Labor has a track record of playing politics, looking for the negative and looking at the half-empty glass and not trying to create opportunities but trying to put impediments in the way of opportunities for Australia's exporters.</DOC>

 - There is something that the opposition could do right now - this afternoon. It could indicate that it has passed the legislation that would give additional top-ups to 35,000 Australian families. We have had legislation blocked in the Senate now for a very long period of time, and the Labor Party refuses to support that legislation. It has absolutely no credibility to raise these issues in the parliament until it gets out of the way and facilitates the passage of that legislation, which would bring relief to 35,000 Australian families. I would remind not only the Leader of the Opposition but also the member for Lilley that the very scheme that the member for Lilley is talking about would not have been possible without tax reform, which he totally opposed from start to finish.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question. He has not just talked about health care; he has delivered it for many years as a medical practitioner in Perth. That is why he is so concerned to ensure that this government delivers - as it has - the best possible health care to the Australian people. Let me say this to the member for Moore: the free trade agreement is a once in a generation opportunity for Australia to link itself to the world's largest and strongest economy. Thanks to the free trade agreement, over time Australia will become part of a domestic economy that is some 300 million people strong. That historic sense of being a small, vulnerable economy in an uncertain world will finally be dispelled thanks to the free trade agreement that this government has negotiated with the American government.Let me make it very clear that the free trade agreement has not compromised the integrity of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Prices to consumers will not rise, the legislation will not change and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee will remain the gatekeeper to the PBS. To increase the transparency of the PBS and to build on the good work that the PBAC has been doing, there will be a transparent independent review process - a formal peer review - that can only make our existing system stronger.This review process will be determined by the government after consultation with the industry, stakeholders, the PBAC and consumers. I am pleased to say that these consultations have already begun and the government expects shortly to announce a draft proposal. Under the review process, all that can happen is that the PBAC may be asked to look again at a particular application. Cost-effectiveness will remain the criteria, the PBAC will remain the judge and the Australian government will remain sovereign over the operation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The free trade agreement is a very good deal for the Australian people, but this government has not compromised the integrity of the PBS to get it.</DOC>

 - I do remember saying in this House something to the effect that there had been no deliberate delay in relation to this matter. The truth is that from time to time any government determines priorities so far as taxation reductions and expenditure are concerned. As I indicated last year, we gave $10 billion of personal tax cuts. When those tax cuts were presented to the parliament, I do not recall the Australian Labor Party voting against them; I recall the Australian Labor Party voting in favour of those tax cuts. I also remind those who sit opposite that we are talking here about the adjustment on an annual basis of people's entitlements to a benefit that is infinitely more generous than any benefit provided by the Australian Labor Party.The member for Lilley talks as if the adjustment of entitlements at the end of the year is the imposition of some kind of new taxation. We are talking here of the adjustment at the end of the year of people's entitlements. My understanding is that something in the order of 66 per cent of people's entitlements do not require any adjustment or, if they do, they attract a top-up. The others involve an adjustment because, through a combination of circumstances, there has been an overpayment of that benefit. Surely the Australian Labor Party is not suggesting that in relation to that 34 per cent of cases we should simply waive the requirement for some adjustment. There is no system that any government can sustain which simply says that, irrespective of the estimates that are made, whatever is paid cannot be the subject of any adjustment.The Labor Party is being completely disingenuous on this issue. If it believed in helping families, it would get out of the way and pass that legislation in the Senate. There are 35,000 Australian families who could benefit tomorrow if the Labor Party got out of the way and acted today to pass that legislation and ensure there would be additional benefit for those 35,000 Australian families.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for his question. I appreciate how much interest he and, I am sure, some of his constituents have in this issue. Obviously a lot of returned service men and women have a particular interest in the future of Changi prison, which, by the way, is still to this day a working prison. The government has made representations to the Singapore government over quite some months now, arguing that whilst we could understand their plans to redevelop Changi prison - in Singapore they do not have an enormous amount of space for construction of new prisons - we would want some of the existing Changi prison, for historic and emotional reasons, to be retained. I have put this, as have other ministers, to the Singapore government on many occasions.I was very pleased to hear at the weekend that the Singapore government have announced that they will be prepared to preserve some of the key elements of the old Changi prison building. They have announced that they are going to preserve a 180-metre stretch of the prison wall and also two corner turrets. A lot of returned service men and women have said that they would like the main gate to be preserved, for understandable reasons. Apparently the Singapore government's decision includes the relocation of the main gate from inside the prison to the stretch of the outside wall which is going to be retained.These components of Changi prison will be preserved as a national monument of Singapore. Australians visiting Singapore will clearly be able to visit the preserved wall and the gates, even though they will still be a component of the external wall of a working prison. I know there will be many Australians - those who were interred there during the Second World War and, of course, their families - who will be delighted that the Singapore government has responded so positively and also, if I could say so, so sensitively to the requests that we and people like the RSL and other veterans have made from Australia. I think it is an illustration of the strength of our relationship with Singapore and an illustration too of their sensitivity to the values and culture of Australia and the things that are important to us. I think all members on both sides of the House would agree that we very much appreciate what the Singapore government has done.Some may argue that the whole of the original prison should be preserved. Whilst on the one hand I can understand that, on the other hand it has to be remembered that this is a working prison and it does need to be rehabilitated and renovated. As I have been inside it myself, I can well and truly understand that. I was there as a visitor; my father spent a little longer there, but in my case I have only managed to visit. I make the point that I think what they are doing is good and sensitive, and I am sure all members of the House will join me in this expression of appreciation to the Singapore government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lilley, who has asked me a question relating to family tax benefits. I will tell you what I can confirm. I can confirm that the government I lead has provided nearly $6,000 a year, on average, in family tax benefit payments to two million Australian families. I can confirm that the government spends about $2 billion more a year on family assistance than did the former government. I can confirm that family tax benefit part B is specifically for families where parents exercise the choice of having one parent staying at home while children are young. I can also confirm that as part of taxation reform, which was opposed by the member for Lilley and all of those who sit beside him on the opposition benches, we cut effective marginal tax rates. I can confirm that families are getting record assistance and are able to keep more of each dollar they earn. I can confirm that, according to a study by the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, only eight per cent of people face an effective marginal tax rate of more than 60 per cent. - In conclusion, I can confirm that this government has introduced a family tax benefit system which, in terms of the size and generosity of its benefits, is unparalleled by any other system ever introduced by any government, and, subject of course to budgetary considerations, it would always be our wish, where possible, to provide further enhancement. But let me remind the House that, if the opposition had had its way, this system would never have been introduced. It would never have been introduced, because it was an integral part of taxation reform and it will always be to the shame of the opposition that a measure that was designed to provide benefits of unparalleled generosity to Australian families was opposed every inch of the way by the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I very much thank the member for Fairfax for his question. I salute his determination to protect the interests of taxpayers from this shameful ripoff. Last week, the Leader of the Opposition refused to say whether he would end the rent rort ripoff. He refused to say whether a future Labor government would renew the lease fleece for a further five years. On Sunday, he could not avoid the questions any longer, and in one of his increasingly rare public interviews the member for Werriwa said to Laurie Oakes:... I don't see any need to do something ... why would any reasonable person have any concerns about it?Here are some reasons. I can inform the House that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet at 3 National Circuit pays $295 a square metre. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in the Edmund Barton Building pays $290 a square metre. The AttorneyGeneral's Department in the Robert Garran Offices pays $295 a square metre. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are in the very prestigious R.G. Casey Building, so they pay $395 a square metre. Of course, the commercial tenant in Centenary House pays just $314 a square metre, but the Australian National Audit Office, thanks to Latham's sweetheart deal, pays $871 per square metre. - All right. It was Keating's sweetheart deal, and he has adopted it. The member for Werriwa may not be concerned, but certainly -  - The Leader of the Opposition may not be concerned, but certainly the Australian National Audit Office is extremely concerned, because in its 200001 report, called the Commonwealth management of leased office property, the Audit Office warns against the very trick of which it is the victim. It says:Agencies should seek to avoid ratchet clauses in their future lease arrangements, to ensure that they are only exposed to normal market rentals.Doesn't the Audit Office know? Thanks to the sweetheart deal negotiated between the former Labor government and the Labor Party, the Australian National Audit Office is in breach of its own rules. This is not ancient history of no concern to the mahatma. This is now. In the 100 days that the Leader of the Opposition has been in his current position, he has collected $672,000. Every day he sits there smugly, he is collecting $6,721 thanks to this scandalous rort. What did he say to Laurie Oakes at the end of quite a long discussion on this? He said to Laurie Oakes:I'm ashamed of nothing in this matter.He says that because he knows no shame. He is completely shameless. If he had any concern for ethics in politics he would end the rent rort ripoff now.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question and for the interest that I know he has in the welfare of the people of Iraq. Yesterday the Iraqi governing council, the leaders of Iraq, signed a landmark transitional administrative law agreement. This is, in effect, the constitution which will provide guidance for the new Iraq. On behalf of the government, I take the opportunity to say that we applaud the interim governing council members, who have set aside their differences in order to map out a democratic future for Iraq. This shows that Iraqis are now successfully taking control of their own destiny. The transitional administrative law arrangement sets out the fundamental principles for governing Iraq, which are that the system of government will be federal, democratic and pluralistic and that all Iraqis will have equal rights and freedoms, regardless of their origins, their gender or their religious beliefs. For minorities this is an unprecedented development. Kurdish will be one of the official languages of Iraq, Iraqis who speak other languages will have a right to educate their children in those languages and any Iraqi, including Jews, Assyrians and Kurds, can reclaim their citizenship if it had been unjustly revoked by Saddam Hussein.This transitional administrative law arrangement is a road map for a democratic Iraqi government. A broadly representative interim government will take over Iraq on 30 June - that is when the coalition provisional authority will be disbanded, the occupation of Iraq by coalition forces will come to an end and the Iraqis will take control of their own destiny. In conclusion, let me say that I think last night's signing of this agreement was a historic moment in the history of Iraq. At long last the people of Iraq will be able to determine their own destiny; at long last they will be able to live in freedom and democracy. If some people think the overthrow of Saddam Hussein was a mistake - and some do - you can rest assured that the people of Iraq do not happen to share that view.</DOC>

We are proceeding with the preparation of the legislation, and it will be introduced in due course. You talk about Labor's policy - I have heard around the traps that the Labor policy originally was in fact nine per cent plus a top-up to be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Indi for her question. I can inform the House that, according to the National Australia Bank, the National Australia Bank business survey indicated that business conditions improved in February, rising 10 points - largely reversing the fall in the month of January. The rise in conditions reflected increases in all components. Respondents reported increases in trading conditions, profitability and employment. At the same time, there was a report of a fall in business confidence, according to the NAB survey, although there was still a very positive overall reading of plus eight. According to the National Australia Bank, the business surveys are consistent with ongoing growth in domestic demand and non-farm GDP at a touch above four per cent. Members will recall that the national accounts, which were released last week, indeed showed the Australian economy growing at about a four per cent clip at the end of last year.The ANZ also released its job vacancies survey today, showing that the number of job advertisements rose by 6.4 per cent in February and is 4.9 per cent higher than a year ago. This is the strongest monthly growth in job advertisements in nine months, and it followed an increase of 2.3 per cent in January. The rise in job advertisements reflected increases in most of the states and territories. The ANZ stated today that these figures suggest the pace of employment growth should remain firm in coming months at around 20,000 to 25,000 per month. This will build on the jobs which have been created in Australia over the last six months.I can tell the honourable member for Indi that over the last six months there have been 196,000 new jobs created in Australia. That compares with 53,300 jobs created in the last six years of Labor government. That is almost four times as many jobs in the last six months as were created in the last six years of the Labor Party government. I know that the honourable member for Indi holds the view that the best thing you can do for young people in Australia and the best thing you can do for children of migrants who come to Australia is give them a job opportunity - an opportunity to get on with their lives and build a secure future. That is what job creation is all about in this country, and it does not come by fluke; it comes from running strong, disciplined economic policy - which has been the hallmark of this government over the last eight years.</DOC>

 - I would have thought that, if anyone were going to ask about backflips, it would not be the member for Hotham, who did a spectacular backflip from the Leader of the Opposition's chair to the bench behind. -  - A backflip -  - There was a suggestion being put that the opposition was hiding the honourable member for Hotham from its policy maker. Let me say, from this side of the House, that we welcome his active involvement in the next election campaign. In relation to superannuation, the government has announced the changes that it will be putting in place, as you heard from the Prime Minister earlier. If I recall correctly, they are changes which are also supported by the Labor Party - although I will observe in passing that in 13 years in office the Labor Party never saw fit to make those changes. - But this is a government that is getting on with this business. It has announced the changes which it will be putting in place. I look forward very much to the debate on the issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. I was rather expecting this question from the Leader of the Opposition, but it did not seem to come. Yesterday the Prime Minister indicated that it is the government's policy not to be increasing taxes and he drew a very large distinction between the two political parties in this country. One side of this parliament believes in lower tax and the other side believes in higher tax. That of course was confirmed by none other than the honourable member for Reid, who yesterday, when he was asked whether Labor would raise taxes after the election, had the decency to say, `I think anyone who didn't say that would be either dishonest or naive.' We thank the honourable member for Reid for the admission that he made yesterday. In passing let me say that we thoroughly repudiate the statement by the member for Werriwa when he said: If the Fergusons were listed on the stockmarket they would trade under the name Nepotism Inc.The member for Werriwa also said:... it is an embarrassment to the Labor movement to think of him as a future minister.Apparently he is not such an embarrassment that the Leader of the Opposition has removed him from the frontbench. The member for Reid has started a veritable avalanche of admission from the Labor Party on their secret tax policy. For example, the honourable member for Fraser is reported on the AAP this morning. `McMullan admits taxes will rise under Labor,' says the AAP. This is the quote from the member for Fraser:Nobody can say that they won't raise taxes over a three-year term, no government since the war has gone through a whole three-year term without changing any tax or charge, it's just dishonest to say that you would. And we've decided not to lie about it - not to lie about their proposal to increase taxes. Seeing as the member for Fraser has decided not to lie about Labor's plan to increase taxes -  - why can't they just tell us what those increases are? - Seeing as the Labor Party are now in full -  - George Washington mode: don't just tell us that you are going to increase taxes; start telling us which of these taxes they will be. The people of Australia want to know which taxes and which levels the Labor Party will be increasing them to.For example, we know that Labor want to increase the fuel excise for the mining industry. They have already announced that. We know that Labor did not rule out yesterday the use of special levies. As the West Australian reports today, they went to Access Economics and they asked Access Economics to fund their policy with special levies, and when they were asked whether or not they would proceed they refused to rule them out. In my tax watch on the opposition - as I have said before, nobody knows more about the policies of the Leader of the Opposition than I do; I have made a special study of them - you do have to keep spinning very fast, but I must say that, on the tax watch in the last 24 hours, I have awarded the points for honesty to the member for Sydney. The member for Sydney was quoted last night on Lateline as saying:I don't think anyone likes to hear that there are new taxes coming up but we've got a big social program and it has to be paid for some way.So we have the member for Reid, the member for Fraser and the member for Sydney - who nods in agreement.Let me tell you why these new taxes are coming from the Australian Labor Party: Labor have $8 billion of unfunded promises. They are going to default on those promises or they are going to drive the budget into deep deficit or they have $8 billion worth of tax increases coming. - For the member for Fraser, I finish by repeating what the member for Fraser said: `We've decided not to lie about it' - not to lie about the fact that under Labor taxes would rise. Come clean: tell us which ones and give us the rates.</DOC>

 - As I indicated to the House yesterday or last week and as is contained in the budget papers, tax as a share of GDP has fallen under this government. If the member for Hotham would like to be reminded of the various components of that reduction, let me remind him of the $12 billion of personal income tax cuts that were delivered on 1 July 2000; the tax cuts for older Australians that were announced in the 2001 budget; the new system of family tax benefits -  - the capital gains tax reforms, so that individuals are only taxed on half their capital gains; the company tax rate that has been reduced from 36 per cent to 30 per cent; the introduction of a measure to refund excess imputation credits, which is of enormous benefit to retired Australians - a group in the Australian community that the Keating government systematically year after year either ignored or insulted or in the course of the year did both; the abolition of wholesale sales tax; the abolition of fuel excise indexation as well as the reduction of 1½c a litre in fuel excise; the abolition of financial institutions duty; and the abolition of the other state taxes. The fact is that this has been a government that has cut taxes not increased them. This is a government that is prepared to give a commitment about future levels of taxation. As the member for Sydney so eloquently pointed out last night, when you have a big social program, when you want to spend a lot of money on a lot of things, you need a lot of taxes. I am going to resume watching Lateline every night. I really am warming towards that program.  - If they keep rolling out talent like the member for Sydney, I will be one of the most compulsive viewers of Lateline that you can find. I want to thank the member for Sydney. I also want to thank the member for Reid. It was a great doorstop that the member for Reid gave. In the course of it he made a throwaway line about throwing money at Catholic schools. Every dollar that we have given to Catholic schools is deserved.I do not apologise for giving money to Catholic schools. I do not regard us as throwing money at Catholic schools. I regard us as rewarding the hard-working parents of children who go to Catholic schools by giving them some additional resources that have been long overdue. It is the most underprivileged, least resourced sector of Australia's school education system. I think it is pretty insulting for the member for Reid in a throwaway line to say that we were throwing money at Catholic schools. I thought the Labor Party supported the money that we were giving to Catholic schools, but apparently the member for Reid thinks we are only throwing money. We have got a different view and we attach a higher priority to funding the Catholic community's education system than does the member for Reid.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moncrieff for his question. He knows, as we all know, that by abolishing a number of taxes the coalition has done great things for small business. Just to remind the House, they are: reducing company tax, abolishing provisional tax, halving capital gains tax, abolishing the indexation of fuel excise, reducing income tax for individuals, helping with capital gains tax relief, rollover relief -  - all initiatives that have sought to help Australia's 1.1 million small businesses. That is one of the reasons why they are doing well, particularly in Moncrieff. The comments from the member for Sydney last night got me thinking. I asked myself, `What are the social programs that the Labor Party believe in and how are they going to pay for them?'</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macarthur for his question. He stands for many things, but foremost among them is a fair go. In the year 2000, the member for Goldstein - when Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs - recognised that there was a problem with the education of boys in Australia and initiated a national parliamentary inquiry into the issue.The situation in Australia at the moment is that boys, particularly in adolescence, are not doing as well in education, particularly in basic literacy, as they were 35 years ago. Further, the problem is not so much that girls are staying on to year 12 and doing much better than boys in year 12; the problem is much more that boys are represented more than two to one in the bottom 25 per cent of performance at school. Boys are falling behind girls by some three to four percentage points in operational literacy right throughout the assessed cognitive curriculum from early primary to late secondary school. If you add to that that boys represent 80 per cent of all schoolchildren in school disciplinary programs and close to 100 per cent of those expelled from school, that they are more likely to be involved in drug related incidents and in assault and that they are three times more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident and five times more likely to take their own lives, it is obvious that our country has a problem.The government has initiated a number of things to address the educational needs of boys and girls but most recently that of boys in particular. The government has funded some 230 schools in 110 projects to examine best practice models in relation to the education of boys. Very shortly, on behalf of the government, I will be announcing funding, on an ongoing basis, for 30 clusters of schools right throughout Australia to be working models in relation to boys' education. The government has also taken on the gender equity framework from the Keating government, and that has evolved. That governs the education of all children, boys and girls.There are many things that we as parents want for our children. We want the education system to nurture them and bring them to adult life as constructive, responsible, well-adjusted human beings. At the moment in Australia there are a number of things happening which I want to draw to the attention of the House: one in seven children are growing up in households in which there is a sole parent who is a woman - through no fault of the woman or indeed, of course, of the children; currently, only 21 per cent - only one in five - of primary school teachers are men; only 18 per cent of those who are training for primary school teaching are men; and, of the 7,000 students in Australia who are studying for early childhood training, only 250 are men - and the situation is deteriorating.The government realises that both men and women bring to teaching specific skills which are necessary to not only transfer a thirst for learning but also to see the well-rounded development of our children. The government will be amending the Sex Discrimination Act to allow employers of teachers - government school employers, Catholic educationalists and employers in the independent sector - to offer gender-specific scholarships to young men, which will encourage them to go into teaching and, having completed teaching, to undertake a career as a primary school teacher.It will do this country no good if we spend the next decade hand-wringing and clinging to misplaced but well-intentioned ideological purity if we produce a generation of young men who are disengaged, who are disillusioned and who feel ill-prepared for the future. The country would pay an enormous price for that. It is time that we allowed commonsense to apply. If the Catholic Education Commission in Australia or any other employer believe that they must get more men into primary schools, they must be listened to. In 250 public state schools in the state of New South Wales the only man on campus - if there is one - is the gardener. We will pay a heavy price for it if we do not undertake significant and strong action now and that is why the government will amend the act to allow the application of commonsense. The future demands it and our boys desperately need it.</DOC>

 - The assessment of import risk analyses are based on science. It is a matter of dealing with the evidence that is put forward and assessing each of the issues. The assessment is undertaken by an expert scientific panel of people chosen because of their particular expertise in the field. When the panel meets, as it does from time to time, to develop the import risk assessment, it does not keep specific minutes because it does not deal with motions moved, seconded and voted on. It does not run like a board or a caucus meeting, where you have to try to keep the factions in line. Essentially what happens at these meetings is that the panel develops the text of the import risk assessment by consensus. They have a draft document that they work through progressively. There are many iterations of that document before it is finally agreed for distribution and for assessment.What has happened with the import risk assessment in relation to bananas is that the expert scientific panel have addressed the disease issues that are of concern, they have recommended ways in which those disease risks can be appropriately mitigated and they have published the document, which is now open for public consultation. It is perfectly appropriate during this 60-day period of consultation that those who have alternative scientific views put them forward. That is what the open and transparent process is all about. If there are scientists in various institutions, wherever they might be, who have different views, this is the time in the process when they can put those views forward. Those views will be considered on their scientific merit.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It will be quite apparent why these matters are of considerable interest to me, as the Attorney-General, and my portfolio. I assure the member for Page that the efforts of the government to manage our borders effectively have been extraordinarily successful. We have had a range of measures. The package has included offshore processing, excisions of certain offshore islands, interdiction and turn around of vessels, and the provision for those found to be refugees to receive temporary protection visas only. It has also included close cooperation with our neighbours to limit the number of people potentially seeking to access our region. Of course, the result is there to be seen. In 2000-01, 4,000 people arrived on some 54 boats. After 2001 we saw very few boat arrivals, and in this past year we can count on one hand the number of boats seeking to reach Australia.The reason for that is clear. It is certainly not for the reasons advanced by the honourable member for Perth, who suggested that it was due to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, the defeat of the Taliban - one would think that these events occurred in 2001 - or our ongoing improved relations with Indonesia. It has become quite obvious that the measures have been working. I think one that has been particularly germane has been the turn around of vessels. In an interview on SBS radio in July 2001, Keis Asfoor, a now successfully prosecuted people smuggler of many hundreds of people to Australia, said:If Australia closes the door and turn back one time a ship, the day a ship is turned back I will stop this thing.We know that the turning around of the perception of being able to deliver people to Australia successfully has been absolutely crucial to us being able to effectively protect Australia's borders and to act in the national interest, and it is the package of measures that has done this. The real concern I have is with people suggesting that those measures, such as the offshore processing, should be unwound, together with a refusal to extend the excisions and a desire to abandon temporary protection visas.There are some other matters that are relevant to this also. I heard on the program Sunday Sunrise some comments from the member for Barton. In relation to the Navy's handling of vessels that might reach Australia, he said:They can't use armed interdiction capacity in our zone, if you like, in our law enforcement zone. That's one of the main reasons the United States created the Coastguard.I am sure that is not the reason they created a coastguard. He went on to say:We have, literally, an unpoliced northern border.Let me enlighten the honourable member for Barton. Section 51(vi) of the Australian Constitution enables the parliament to make laws with respect to the control of forces to execute and maintain the laws of the Commonwealth, and important legislation has been passed by this parliament that enables members of the Defence Force to enforce the law in offshore situations. Amendments to the Customs Act and the Migration Act, introduced as part of this government's package of border protection legislation, provide enforcement powers for use in the maritime area adjacent to Australia - including the territorial sea and the contiguous zone - and powers of hot pursuit. This suggestion that we need a coastguard because in some way we do not have powers in the Navy to be able to interdict and we do not have powers generally is a view born of ignorance of the way in which our law is drafted and crafted. I simply say that, if we are going to be able to act in Australia's interests and deal with these issues, all the avenues need to be available to us. You certainly cannot cherry pick and knock them off individually, one at a time.</DOC>

 - The balance of payments for the December quarter, as I outlined to the House, showed that the current account deficit was $12 billion, or six per cent of GDP, in the December quarter. As I said at the time, we would obviously prefer it to be lower. I do not believe that we should be complacent about it. It compares, however, with a balance of payments deficit of 6.5 per cent back in 1995, so it is less than it was in 1995. More importantly, it is in a lower inflation environment and a lower interest rate environment. Back in 1995 inflation was 3.9 per cent and mortgage interest rates were 10½ per cent, compared with low twos now and low sevens. So the economy is in a stronger position and the current account deficit is lower than it was in 1995 as a percentage of GDP, which is the correct way of measuring it. Having said that, we must not get complacent about these matters and it is important that we do what we can to boost Australia's exports. Boosting Australia's exports involves having a sympathetic tax regime, especially taking taxes off exports, improving our waterfront and our shipping and transport routes and making sure that we keep the Australian economy productive. There is so much more we can still do, including improving Australia's labour markets - probably the No. 1 reform that Australia could do with now.Official interest rates in Australia are at 5 per cent and, by Australian standards, they are low. In New Zealand they are 5 per cent.  - The member for Kennedy rightly says that the official rate in the United States is one per cent, which is substantially lower than 5 per cent, which is the Australian rate. The reason why the official interest rate in the US is one per cent is that the US economy has been through a recession. The US economy went into recession in 200001 and the US Federal Reserve brought the official interest rate down to try and stimulate it out of recession. The reason why official interest rates in Japan are at about a quarter of a per cent is that Japan has been through three recessions since this government came to office. Not only has the Australian economy not been through a recession since 1996 but also we have been amongst the fastest growing countries in the OECD year after year. This is not a recession economy, unlike the US and Japan. When we compare Australia's interest rates to the historical position in Australia, they are low. As I said earlier, compared with 1995, we have home mortgage rates in the low sevens compared with 10½. If you want to go back further to other occasions when Australia's current account has been around six per cent, we were doing that sometimes on interest rates of 17 per cent back in the late 1980s. Having said all of that, I do want to pick up on one point put by the member: yes, the Australian dollar has appreciated considerably against the US dollar since the beginning of last year; it has appreciated by something like 40 per cent. That has made life harder for our exporters. But I point out to the member for Kennedy that there was huge volatility both ways. Part of the reason why it appreciated by 40 per cent is that it reached historical lows below US50c, so it was coming off a very low base. I can remember saying at the time - and you will recall the opposition getting up in parliament day after day complaining about the low exchange rate, the member for Hotham leading the charge - that this would be good for Australia's exporters. Actually in a macroeconomic sense it was helpful. But we could not expect that to last forever and, as a consequence, the Australian dollar has come back and come back significantly, by about 40 per cent. The only thing I can say in relation to farmers is that, whilst that has made a difficulty, I do believe that an even bigger problem for our farmers in the last year was not the value of the exchange rate; it was getting production, because in the middle of it we had the worst drought in 100 years. It did not matter what the price was if you did not have production. So the good news in the last year is that production has been coming back. A second point I will make in relation to Australia's mineral industry is that, whilst it is true that the exchange rate has worked against our mineral exporters, the fact that countries like China are now taking so much of our mineral exports means that, notwithstanding the rise in the exchange rate, commodity prices have been rising with it. Some of our mineral companies are now as profitable as they have been. It will be good if that huge demand could be met with a more favourable exchange rate; but you must also bear in mind that huge demand will also have an influence on an exchange rate like Australia's, which is considered to be influenced by commodities.So I say to the member for Kennedy that I agree with some of what he says. I would like our exporters to be as competitive as possible. But I can promise him this: this government will not for a moment be moving from strong economic policy, because too many people's livelihoods depend upon it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Farrer for her question. - The Howard government, as members of this House are aware, is committed to restoring and protecting the environmental health of the Australian continent. That is evidenced more strongly than anything else by the Natural Heritage Trust and the national action plan for salinity, the greatest environmental rescue package in Australian history. At the end of February, I announced the commitment by the Howard government of some $434 million to the New South Wales catchment authorities over the current and the next three financial years. This commitment means that each of the 11 New South Wales regional authorities now has a very clear indication of the money that they will be receiving over this fouryear period so that they can plan strategically how they will address the environmental and natural resource issues that they face, restore water quality, revegetate the river banks and roll back salinity. It means that the communities of the central west, for example, can now plan strategically in restoring water and wetland quality along the Macquarie, Castlereagh and Bogan rivers, because the central west now knows that it has the resources to plan ahead. The communities of the border rivers in the Gwydir region will now be able to move ahead with strategic programs to build sustainable farming, roll back salinity and act on soil erosion, and the communities of the Murray catchment, which the member for Farrer will be particularly interested in, will be able to press ahead with wetland restoration and, particularly, the implementation of the land and water management plans and the strengthening of the catchments in this vital area, because we have committed some $68.1 million to this task.The great change that has come about through the environmental policies of this government has been that we have moved from funding individual, isolated projects to a strategic approach for dealing with environmental issues on a landscape scale. There are comparable new funding announcements which we are discussing with each of the other states, and they will enable the regional communities to plan ahead in a strategic way and will give certainty and confidence to the whole national task of environmental restoration.While we are giving certainty to regional communities, I regret to say that the Labor Party is only creating uncertainty for regional communities. We saw this with the trip of the Leader of the Opposition to Gladstone a week ago, where he announced two costly programs that would burden the aluminium and alumina industries - so important to Gladstone - raising their costs and destroying jobs in those industries. This is part of a deliberate strategy on the part of the Labor Party to press ahead with environmental programs that are funded out of taxation by heavy regulations that impose additional costs on and undermine the competitiveness of Australian industry.It is very interesting that the shadow minister, the member for Wills, has said that the billion dollar commitment we have made to greenhouse gas reduction is just a mickey mouse commitment. So far as he is concerned, a billion dollars is peanuts, because the Labor Party has in mind much more spending and much higher taxes to finance that spending. The greatest level of uncertainty that is now facing those communities in Australia who are serious about the environment is the taxation policy of the Labor Party, because, while this government has funded large-scale environmental policies by creating wealth, all the Labor Party seems to be able to think about is higher taxes and higher spending that will undermine enterprise, cut back on wealth creation and make this country much less able in the future to deal with its environmental problems.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wills for his question. The government take climate change very seriously, and that is why we put in place certain world-leading programs to address this issue. Amongst these was the establishment of the Australian Greenhouse Office, which was the first agency in the world to address the issue of greenhouse gas reduction. The Australian Greenhouse Office has been an exceptionally successful initiative of this government, and through its programs it has put Australia on track to reach the internationally negotiated target for greenhouse gas emissions in 2010.The office has recently been reviewed by the Australian National Audit Office. The questions that the member for Wills asks arise out of the report of the Audit Office. To put it in context, the Audit Office has given the Australian Greenhouse Office a big tick. The Audit Office report is a very positive report about the Greenhouse Office. It makes the point, for example, that `the selection of projects is transparent and based on merit'. It also says:... the financial management systems in the AGO are sound. The AGO has implemented good practice in making payments progressively against milestones and withholding payments where milestone requirements are not met....	...	...Performance monitoring to date has been thorough and given the necessary priority.This has been a very positive report for the Australian Greenhouse Office and for the government's programs. It contrasts with a report on the greenhouse policies of the previous government by the Australian Audit Office when it conducted a report in 1992-93 called Implementation of an Interim Greenhouse Response. The report concluded that the then Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the government:... had not taken sufficient action to implement the package of measures announced in 1990.In other words, when the Audit Office looked at Labor's performance it was dissatisfied; when it looked at our performance it was satisfied.In relation to the specific matter raised by the member for Wills - that is, that ministers asked the AGO not to recommend the GGAP projects they should fund - the reason for that was that ministers wish to consider the comprehensive risk assessment for a whole range of potential projects and these were whole of government decisions. It was established by the Audit Office that the projects that were approved comprehensively met the program guidelines.Being a world first initiative, the Greenhouse Office naturally has to experiment and it had to experiment with different kinds of programs to see the programs that would be effective and the programs that would not be effective. When one looks at the projects and outcomes from its work, it has undoubtedly been exceedingly successful.If the member for Wills is not clear on this from reading the report, perhaps he should visit the Audit Office personally. He will find it in Centenary House, where it is currently subject to a massive rip-off by the Labor Party and is being forced to pay $871 per square metre in rent, making it the world's most expensive office space. I suggest to the member for Wills that he should go around there. He should perhaps carry a message from the Leader of the Opposition that the Labor Party withdraws from this unethical arrangement and get a first-hand briefing from the Audit Office.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie, whose constituents want to end the Labor Party's $36 million rip-off. This morning, we had the Leader of the Opposition out there on radio trying to explain away the stinking dead cat around his neck - the Centenary House rent rort will haunt him every day until he repudiates it. This is what he said to Mike Carlton this morning: `The only reason they have raised this now was there was a change in the Labor leadership.' That is typical self-preoccupation by the Leader of the Opposition. I know he thinks nothing ever happened until 2 December last year, but let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that in the last parliament the former minister for finance successfully moved a censure motion on the then Leader of the Opposition. In this parliament, government ministers raised Centenary House on no fewer than 13 separate occasions prior to that diei mirabile when the Leader of the Opposition assumed his current eminence.I have a long memory, and I seem to recall that my own very first question in this House back in May 1994 was about the Centenary House rip-off. - It was a rip-off then and it is a rip-off now -  - and it should end immediately. - The essential facts of the lease fleece are these: the commercial tenant in Centenary House is paying $314 a square metre; the ALP is getting $871 a square metre. They are the essential facts. That is the $36 million free gift that the Leader of the Opposition is pocketing as a result of the rent rort rip-off.You would expect the Audit Office, as a responsible organisation, to try to change it. Three times, the Audit Office has tried to end the rip-off and three times they have been turned down by the Australian Labor Party. On 8 March 2002 the Audit Office wrote:It is clear that economic conditions have changed markedly since the original lease was entered into and this has resulted in the lease escalation arrangements in particular being far in excess of provisions included in more recent lease agreements in the Barton area.This got under the skin of the Labor Party because they wrote back - not just once but three times, on 28 August 2002, on 18 September 2002 and on 29 March 2003 - saying that it was impossible to change the lease agreements because the mortgage arrangements would not permit it. Well, the mortgage arrangements have changed, they now have a different lender so they should end the lease fleece now. But there is more. In April 2003, not satisfied, the Audit Office goes back to the Labor Party and says, `Please end the rent rort.' Tim Gartrell, the national secretary of the Audit Office, said, `No; we are not going to do it.' They wrote again saying end the rip-off. But again nothing has been done.I have been asked what is stopping the renegotiation. I should have been asked who is stopping the renegotiation because it is pretty clear who it is. He said yesterday, `I'm ashamed of nothing in this matter.' The man with no shame. The man who claims that he has never told a lie and then he says 'I'm not ashamed of anything in this matter.' Who is stopping the renegotiation? It is the Leader of the Opposition. He would rather pocket the money - a lazy $6,721 every day - than do the right thing by the Australian people. He should end the rent rort now.</DOC>

 - The answer is no. I point out that the proposal advanced by the Leader of the Opposition was to abolish NOIE and use the $140 million savings for other purposes. The Leader of the Opposition suggested the spending on NOIE, the National Office for the Information Economy, be used for his Read Aloud project. I had that proposal analysed and it would have meant the immediate scrapping of 160 jobs, Australia's global efforts to combat spam, the coordination of the National Broadband Strategy and the Information Technology Online program to drive e-business uptake. In other words, if you were going to realise the savings immediately, as he suggested, these would be the consequences. So it was a pretty ill-conceived and ill-thought-out proposal. It would also have meant the end of research into the impact of ICT on the Australian economy, the development and support of government services online, the government online tendering system - AusTender - and government coordination of Australia's domain name policies.The opposition spokesman has denied that any jobs are in jeopardy. The functions previously carried out by NOIE will be split, under our proposal, between a new Australian government information management office and the Office for the Information Economy within DCITA. All of those functions - including combating spam and maintaining government online services - will, unlike what was proposed by the Leader of the Opposition, be maintained. There is no semblance between his proposal and what we intend to do.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question. I know how concerned he is to ensure that the best possible health care services are delivered to the people of his electorate. I can inform the House that the government has today reached agreement with the Independent and minor party senators on a series of enhancements to the MedicarePlus package. It was a very good package as proposed by the government but it is now even better, thanks to the insights and diligence of the senators. The government will be proceeding with the MedicarePlus legislation in the Senate this afternoon and I would urge members opposite to give it swift, speedy passage so that people with high health care costs can get the help that they need.The government's MedicarePlus safety net is necessary because in the real world not everyone is going to get bulk-billed. I can inform the House that the latest figures show that 33,000 individuals and families have already incurred MBS gap expenses exceeding $300 since the start of this year. Under the agreement reached with the Independent senators, the safety net threshold has been reduced to $300 for concession card holders and people on family tax benefits and $700 for others. I can inform the House that, by 2007, 490,000 individuals and families will benefit from the safety net, but 20 million Australians will have the security and reassurance of knowing that the safety net is there if they get into trouble with their health care costs.In addition, there will be a $7.50 incentive payment for bulk-billed GP consultations for cardholders and children in non-metropolitan areas and in Tasmania, which has very low bulk-billing rates. Further, there will be a new MBS item for allied health services delivered for and on behalf of a doctor as part of an enhanced care plan to treat chronic and complex medical conditions. This is a very important innovation, which should mean less prescription medicine and a more holistic health care system. And, yes, there is provision for dental treatment, but only where this is necessary to treat a chronic and complex medical condition. As a result of the changes announced today, the government will be spending an additional $426 million over the forward estimate period. That brings the MedicarePlus package to a $2.85 billion enhancement to our Medicare system.The Howard government has always been prepared to invest what is necessary -  - to give the Australian people the health care system that they need. This is a great day for Medicare - a brand new safety net based on actual charges, not on a schedule fee, and, for the first time, allied health services can be delivered under the Medicare system.I would like to thank the Independent and minor party senators for their constructive engagement with the government. I have to say that in my view what has happened illustrates Australian democracy at its best. Because they are so often forgotten - those unseen pillars of our great democracy - I would also like to thank the departmental officers who have invested countless hours of professionalism and diligence in bringing us a much better health care system.</DOC>

 - In reply to the member for Macquarie: yes, I am aware of problems facing the teacher recruitment base in Australia. There is little argument that this country faces a chronic shortage of male teachers in all of its schools, particularly its primary schools. The worst example of that is to be found in the Catholic education system in New South Wales, where the number of male teachers has fallen to an alarming level of only 14 per cent. Throughout the nation altogether, only one in five teachers in primary schools is a man. Undoubtedly, this represents a very serious challenge to policy makers at both a state and federal level.I am certainly aware of this, and until last night I also thought that the Leader of the Opposition was aware of this. I did a little research and I found that, writing in the Herald Sun on 30 August 2002, the Leader of the Opposition had this to say:Unfortunately, there has also been a decrease in the number of male teachers in our schools. I can visit primary schools in my electorate and barely find a man in the place - someone who can offer guidance to the boys at school.He went on to say:Boys without role models and mentors can easily go off the rails. We see this in the formation of gangs - one of the most worrying threats to community safety.He was right then - just as the Deputy Prime Minister, who, first of anybody in this place, raised this issue years ago, was right - to indicate the lack of male role models for young boys growing up in single-parent households with no father, no older brothers and no close male relatives and with the one hope of a viable male role model in their early years being a male teacher at their school. If they happen to be one of the boys attending the 250 primary schools in the state of New South Wales run by the New South Wales government in which there is not one male teacher, they are going to miss out.I thought until last night that the Leader of the Opposition and I were together on this issue. I thought this might have been one of those issues about which the Leader of the Opposition said, when he assumed his position, that he would put aside the negative politics of the past and adopt the new politics of not being opposed for opposition's sake. But I was wrong. Last night, when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Attorney-General put out a statement which represented the triumph of narrow ideology over commonsense, I found that I was wrong.What we have proposed is a sensible response to a request from the Catholic Education Commission of Australia. What we are proposing is opposed by the Leader of the Opposition, not on any grounds of commonsense and not out of an overriding longer term interest in finding a practical solution to this problem but as a demonstration that the old politics still dominate the Australian Labor Party. It is one thing to talk the talk. It is one thing to run around the country for three months and profess your concern for the fatherless boys of Australia. But it is another thing, when you have got an opportunity to put your hand up and do something for them, to not do so. This is a classic demonstration of what the Treasurer said always typifies the Australian Labor Party: never listen to what they say; have a look at what they do. On this occasion, the Leader of the Opposition has failed his own rhetoric. For three months he has regaled the Australian nation with his concern about the need for male role models but, when he gets an opportunity to actually do something, he fails the test. He comes bottom of the class.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I can tell the House that we have had some long car trips visiting remote parts of her electorate where we have talked about these sorts of issues. We have commented on what an excellent job all of those women schoolteachers do but also how many of them would actually like some more men in the classrooms and schools to help them with that gender imbalance problem. I have talked about this issue many times - since noticing very early on no real interest in this on the other side - as a federal member, because I represent a number of country towns which I think are a microcosm of some of the social whirlwind issues that we are now having to address. And that is particularly the case in Indigenous communities.There are problems with boys unable to relate properly to others because they have not had an effective relational model at home, boys with little or no respect for women because they have not had a male role model or a father to show them how to treat people of the opposite sex with respect and decency, and boys with little capacity to handle emotions like anger - a common male problem - because they have not seen a disciplined male role model at home. As I commented in this place a while ago, that sort of essential emotional security is critically important to subsequent academic and career capacity development.The stats - and I am indebted to the Minister for Education, Science and Training for them - show the problems: the underachievement of boys at school, boys in trouble with the law and youth suicide rates. This has long been a social issue that has concerned me. It is an issue that deserves and needs a bipartisan approach from us all. It was in that context that I congratulated the Leader of the Opposition on raising the matter in the public arena. I actually made the point of saying, `He has been able to do a little more than I could because he comes from the side of the social progressives who don't normally like to hear it, whereas if you hear it from an old conservative like me they say, 'He's just rabbiting on.'' He thinks it is important, and I think that is a good thing.  - Yes, a young conservative rabbiting on. I took it as a signal that we could achieve a bit of bipartisanship here. An obvious avenue for society to explore, if it wants to help, is to find substitute male role models where there are not any at home or where the ones at home are inadequate or inappropriate. If society cares about this, there is a good avenue to take: get some more male teachers into our schools. That is not to insult lady teachers at all. My wife happens to be one of them. She will tell me that one of the things we need is more men in the classroom and in the school ground. Nobody can pretend that they can be an adequate substitute for a father doing their job, but they can be a great example of a guiding hand, as the Leader of the Opposition would apparently have had us believe until very recently.We have trouble attracting male teachers and we have trouble retaining them. So many of them are frustrated with the lack of support they get when they are trying to do their bit in the classroom. The Prime Minister has just referred to the numbers. So, when the Catholic schools came up with a modest plan which seemed like a good idea to enable them to draw in teachers, I for one really had every expectation that the Leader of the Opposition would join us and that he would match his rhetoric with some action - and the rhetoric has been pretty strong. We thought he would try and match it with some action. After all, he had declared himself to be a male role model for fatherhood and a champion for young males. That is how he set himself up, but he has not been. He has failed at the high bar. It was not a very high bar, I have to say, but he has failed at it. The father figure himself has turned his back on the very qualities of conviction, determination and integrity that we all believe we need to instil in our boys. I am afraid that it is very much a case of Mark the Mentor, Mark the Lionheart out there in the political jungle fighting for the boys, but the union movement must be very relieved to notice that, yet again, one little tug from the union messenger - in this case the member for Jagajaga - and suddenly it is Mark the Mouse.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Flinders for his question. I can inform him and the House that, as the budget papers show, since the government was elected, the tax to GDP ratio has fallen from 23.5 per cent in 1996-97 to 21 per cent in 2003-04. - So the ratio of taxation to GDP has fallen during the course of this government. As I have also pointed out, even if one were to add the GST back in as a Commonwealth tax and net out the state taxes which it replaced, one would still get a falling ratio. The Labor Party in their efforts to try and rewrite the figures say, `Oh, GST should be counted as a Commonwealth tax, but the gambling tax it replaced, the financial institutions duty it replaced, the bed tax it replaced and the stamp duty on gaming should be counted as state taxes.' Therefore, we got a unilateral cut in state taxation with the introduction of the GST. The states cut their taxes, and the Commonwealth increased its taxes - a translation between the two levels of government. No, I am afraid that when one nets out the state taxes that it replaced - including, I should say, the business franchise fees, which were called revenue replacements - one gets a falling tax to GDP ratio. And that has occurred under this government.If this government were running the same tax to GDP ratios today as were being run under the Labor Party when it came to office, the taxation in this country could be as much as $10 billion to $20 billion higher. I was reminded of this as I saw an extraordinary performance on Lateline last night from none other than the member for Fraser. I was sitting up in bed, and there were a number of points at which I was so struck by what he said that I fell out of bed. - Oh, no, it is very boring in my bed, member for Hunter. The most exciting thing in my bed last night was watching the member for Fraser. - Those of us who lead abstemious lives in Canberra have to get our kicks somewhere: we watch the member for Fraser on Lateline. I was actually quite amazed as to why the shadow minister for finance would be out talking about tax policy, because the Labor Party does actually have a shadow Treasurer. Rumours that he is being hidden are grossly exaggerated.When he was asked about the Access Economics paper that the Labor Party had commissioned, the member for Fraser said:Well, I'm not very much involved with that project, so I can't give you much detail.Well, I can, because I have got the project. The project is being done by Geoff Carmody, Chris Richardson, John Sutton, Rob Raether and Russ Campbell; it costs $150,000; and it is working on a tax policy for the Labor Party - to increase capital gains tax and introduce new levies. I will just table that for the member for Fraser, and I suggest that he acquaint himself with it before he goes on Lateline.We have now had the member for Reid, who has disclosed the Labor Party's plan to increase taxes; we have had the member for Sydney, who has disclosed the Labor Party's plan to increase taxes; and we have had the member for Fraser himself, who disclosed yesterday that Labor would not rule out increasing taxes. But, as I have always said in this parliament - and the Prime Minister mentioned it before - look at what they do, not what they say. If you want a guide to what Labor's tax policy after an election would be, have a look at what they did after the last time they were elected in 1993. As I recall, in 1993 the Labor Party promise was:... what I am promising is not to put up tax.What that meant was that income tax cuts were abolished, wholesale sales taxes were hiked, wine tax was introduced and the whole of the Commonwealth account was pushed up in tax.If you want the Labor Party speaking honestly about their taxation views, you need to go to those confidential surveys that are conducted on the condition of anonymity. One such was a survey of the candidates in the Australian election for 2001, which included all of the Labor candidates, on the condition of anonymity. All candidates were invited to take part. - Yes, I am coming to it. The answer is 88. That is a small sample, isn't it? How many members does the Labor Party have in the House? - Anyway, the question was: if the government had a choice between reducing taxes or spending more on social services, which do you think it should do? Eighty-four Liberal Party and National Party members confidentially responded to that question. The number out of 84 that said that they would strongly or mildly favour reducing taxes was 65. Eighty-eight members of the Labor Party in a confidential survey were asked this question: if the government had a choice between reducing taxes or spending more on social services, which do you think it should do? Of the 88 Labor Party respondents, the number that strongly or mildly favoured reducing taxes was three. - We can name them, because we know one of them. - We know that senators could also be included in this, but I must say it would be odds-on that the remaining two did not include the member for Hotham and the member for Fraser.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook, who agrees with me that payroll tax is an insidious tax. I think it was actually created by the Labor Party back in 1941. How ironic it is that the party that pretends to be the party for workers introduced a tax on jobs! It is also ironic that since 1996 we have helped to create more than a million new jobs and helped to bring unemployment down to 5.7 per cent, and, amazingly, the beneficiaries of those initiatives are the Labor states. For example, the member for Cook's electorate is in New South Wales, and in New South Wales we have helped to create nearly 400,000 new jobs and Bob Carr collects an extra $2 billion in payroll tax. Some of the small businesses in Australia, such as those in the member for Cook's electorate, could be paying up to $5,000 a year to state Labor governments in payroll tax. Of course, payroll tax is not a profit tax and it is not a turnover tax; it is a tax on jobs. It does not matter whether the company or the business is making money or not, employers still have to pay this tax on jobs.I found some support for this from the member for Werriwa, the current Leader of the Opposition. He criticised the states and territories for slugging small business. In this place he said:... it is absurd for state governments throughout Australia to be taxing labour inputs with payroll taxes.I imagine he agrees with his own view. Does he agree? - He could be like Harpo Marx: one honk on the horn for yes and two for no. Mr Speaker, does he agree with his own view? It is not hard. He went on to point out that payroll taxes `encourage employers to minimise labour inputs'. That is, they are an employment tax that discourages job creation. Unfortunately now the Labor Party wants to introduce a federal payroll tax. Labor's own policy document `A better way of life for working families' - how ironic - states:Under Labor's approach, there would be a national insurance system for employee entitlements. All employers would be expected to contribute 0.1 per cent of payroll.This a federal Labor policy to introduce a new federal Labor payroll tax. We know it starts small -  - but understand this: wholesale sales tax -  - which was introduced by the Labor Party, started at 2.5 per cent. We abolished it when it was 42 per cent on some goods at the highest level, and 32 per cent at a range of other levels. The Labor Party knows that once you introduce a new federal payroll tax it means that every business has to create the infrastructure to pay that tax. That means quarterly returns, additional red tape and a new bureaucracy to police the new federal Labor payroll tax. The Labor Party in the ACT is introducing a 2½ per cent payroll tax on every employee - no threshold. - It is absolutely true, and it was backed up by the member for Lyons yesterday when he interjected -  - It was backed up by the member for Lyons in this place yesterday when he said it is Labor Party policy to have a payroll tax `to pay for the portability of long service leave'. The Labor Party believes in a federal payroll tax, it believes in taxes on jobs and it believes in higher taxes. We are the parties that believe in lower taxes.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question. It is a very relevant question for him because people have attempted to arrive illegally on the coast which forms part of his own electorate. In relation to the 15 people who tried to illegally enter Australia the other day and who were taken on board HMAS Warramunga, the Indonesians are now to send a consular official to Christmas Island to assist with processing. These people, consistent with the government's policy on illegal migrants, will be sent back to Indonesia because we understand that they are all Indonesian citizens. The fact that the Indonesians are yet again cooperating with Australia on this issue demonstrates the success of the joint commitment that we have to dealing with this problem, and that is one of the reasons why we have been so successful in doing so over the last 2½ years.The honourable member for Kalgoorlie asked if there were any alternatives. There has of course been the alternative of the Labor Party's policy - the so-called `coast guide' policy. Honourable members may have forgotten, but the Labor policy was to scrap the Navy from the role of making sure that people are not illegally able to come to Australia - just get rid of the Navy and replace its role with three motorboats which are called `coast guides' - not coast guards, coast guides. Labor's policy, very importantly, is to make sure they do not turn anybody back. These people have all to be allowed to arrive in Australia. So they have the three coast guide boats and they were going to set up - I had not realised this - a seabed radar system. What that was to do was to detect the boats when they were actually going across the top of the radar system. Fair enough. The defence department does not think this would be very effective. I read today in the Sydney Morning Herald, in an article under the very aggressive headline `Snipers and choppers bolster ALP coastguard', that the seabed radar system is now to be scrapped. The member for Barton told the Sydney Morning Herald that Labor had to rework its coast guide policy. I thought this policy was a great policy, then all of a sudden I read today that it has to be reworked - more than that - to `really give it grunt in terms of its interdiction capacity'. In other words it did not have grunt in terms of interdiction capacity before - is that right? It is obviously right, because they had three motorboats - no Navy - which were going to guide the illegal migrants into Australia. That is not a tough policy. So there is a new policy now. The new policy is to take the money which was to be used for the seabed radar - that is, $32 million - and with that $32 million buy 10 more boats and crew them. That is $3.2 million a boat, not just for purchase but also for crew, and these boats are only to move within Australia's territorial waters. These are not going to be coastguard boats. These are going to be water taxis - that is all they will be. So you have got three motorboats out there - the coast guide - and you have 10 water taxis now and, what is more, you are going to have helicopters with snipers in them. What in the Lord's name are helicopters and snipers going to do, when your policy is to bring all these people to Australia?  - That is their policy. The Labor Party's policy is not to keep people out. The bottom line here is that the Labor Party has made it clear it will not turn people back. So, with three motorboats - called coast guide boats - 10 water taxis and a couple of helicopters with snipers in them, what are these people supposed to be doing? That is $612 million wasted in just guiding people into Australia. I have a suggestion for the Labor Party as an alternative policy: bearing in mind it is going to allow everybody to land in Australia, it should scrap its new policy, which it has just launched today in the Sydney Morning Herald, and just go out and propose to purchase a dozen or two dozen phone booths and put them on the beach so when the illegal migrants land they can just ring up and say, `We're here; come and get us.' There is absolutely no point in wasting money on water taxis and motorboats and helicopters with snipers in them. What are these people going to be doing - other than guiding the illegal migrants in? At the end of the day, this policy is nothing more than a trick, because the fundamentals of the Labor policy - the serious points about it - are that anybody who wants to come to Australia illegally is welcome to come. Yes, sure, they will be processed when they get here, but they are welcome to come. Actually, our policy is quite different: we turn them around and send them back, and that has been a pretty effective policy. There would not be a person in Australia who would argue that - sure, it has been tough, they will argue about that - our policy was not effective. Yes, we are tough. And in stark contrast, the Labor Party is weak. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The first point I have to make is: I have not seen the so-called leaked documents so I am not in a position to comment on them. But there are some other comments I would like to make. The first is that I have yet to meet anybody in rural, regional or remote Australia who believes that the Labor Party could give a tuppeny damn about what sorts of services they have. The second comment I would make is that I am rarely asked questions by the opposition about Telstra and rural telecommunications services. The last time I was asked I issued a simple challenge: is there anyone on that side who does not believe that the government of the day has all the heads of power it needs to insist on adequate services for rural, regional and remote Australians regardless of ownership? Because the government does have the power, and those opposite know it. The shadow minister for communications knows it. What I would like my friends up in the gallery to do -  - Mr Speaker, through you, if I may, to the gallery -  -  - There are not many there - what a pity. They have not stayed behind for the shadow minister's questions. What I would love them to do is to publish every press release of the shadow minister for communications - every single one of them. I have never seen such undiluted tripe of the sort that you get from the shadow minister. It is just extraordinary. But there is only one take beyond the obvious, which is that he is a political opportunist, and that is this: if he had his way, he would completely and absolutely reregulate Telstra so we could not tell the difference between Telstra and the old PMG. I tell you what, if ever we had lousy services in the country it was when we had the PMG.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the honourable member for Macarthur for his question. The member for Macarthur well and truly recognises the importance of this agreement to the Australian economy, linking Australia's economy to the largest economy in the world and, of course, the opportunities that that will present to all the small business people and manufacturing industries in Western Sydney. In fact, it was interesting to read an article in Time magazine - I think it came out this morning - which said:But here's a rare instance where doors on opposite sides of the globe soon could open to profit-hungry, dynamic, brave and creative Australians ...I am sure there are lots of them in the seat of Macarthur in Western Sydney, and they are well represented by another brave and creative Australian. The member for Macarthur knows only too well - and the Leader of the Opposition, also being a member from Western Sydney, should also know only too well - the importance of the manufacturing exporting industries in Western Sydney. The Leader of the Opposition would be well aware that manufacturing is the biggest single employer in Western Sydney, particularly in Camden and Campbelltown, employing around 14,000 people and generating about $1.2 billion worth of turnover. I am sure the Leader of the Opposition has also recognised by now - or would have been advised by Senator Conroy - that, as result of the free trade agreement negotiated with the United States, 97 per cent of manufactured products will gain tariff-free access into the United States, meaning job creation and job growth in those areas where the manufacturing industries are.One classic example of this is the removal of the tariff on vehicle inspection systems. I know that there is a business in the seat of Macarthur that is well known to the member for Macarthur called Vehicle Inspection Systems Pty Ltd, which designs, manufactures, sells and services a range of specialist heavy vehicle testing equipment for the road transport industry world wide. Guess what, Mr Speaker? Guess where its largest market is? Its largest market is in North America. The company says that the elimination of the duty paid on its exports to the United States will give it a competitive advantage and lead to a further expansion of its already 50-strong work force.So no wonder the member for Macarthur is a strong supporter of the Australia-US free trade agreement. He knows that it will benefit not only the Australian economy but also particularly his constituents in the seat of Macarthur. We all know one of the more famous constituents in the seat of Macarthur. The challenge still rests before the Labor Party to stop opposing this, to stop trawling and digging around to find the negatives in this agreement, and to be like the member for Macarthur and recognise the importance of this agreement to the small business manufacturers of Western Sydney.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Maranoa. These are important issues, and I appreciate him raising them in the House today. As the honourable member knows, Australia has been in the forefront of efforts to deal with the threat of weapons of mass destruction proliferation. This, of course, has been in the case of Iraq, but we have taken firm action in the International Atomic Energy Agency and in other forums to ensure that states comply with their obligations under various international instruments, including the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. I visited Iran in May 2003. My officials and I have a lot of contact with the Iranians, and we have delivered strong messages to them about the pursuit of sensitive nuclear technologies.The Iraq war no doubt had an impact, and also other elements of international pressure did lead Iran to reveal its pursuit of sensitive nuclear activities. We have welcomed their greater engagement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, but the nuclear program in Iran has turned out to be more extensive and more advanced than had previously been thought. This will be a matter discussed at the International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors meeting this week, and honourable members will know that Australia is one of the members of that board.Amongst the revelations that the IAEA has brought forward is the fact that Iran have breached strict export conditions on the use of an Australian supplied mass spectrometer. A mass spectrometer measures in fine detail the composition of materials and has a wide range of applications. This export was intended to support agricultural and medical research, including cancer diagnosis, but the IAEA has discovered that this export was used to test enriched uranium samples, and Iran have admitted to this happening on at least one occasion. We have explained to the Iranian government that they have breached their export conditions and have sought a full explanation from them and asked Iran to return the instrument if we cannot be confident that they will adhere to the strict conditions governing the instrument's use. Iran have provided details of their activities, and they assisted our ambassador in making an inspection of the mass spectrometer on 7 March. The government values its relationship with Iran. We are engaging constructively with them on the nuclear issue. We welcome Iran's cooperation and hope that the fact that the conditions of the export permit were breached on this occasion and the fact that we have now made this public will ensure that such activities do not occur again in the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It is not for me to defend or not defend Telstra. -  - No, it is not. The shadow minister, as I say, wants to completely smother the outfit -  - He basically wants to renationalise it. I remember what we had when we had the PMG. I will tell you what it is our job, as the government, to do and you do not deny we know how to do it - that is, to insist that Telstra meet the universal service obligations and the customer guarantees that we have outlined, which you never bothered putting up and which we have put in place. If they meet those obligations, then quite frankly, if they generate through their business activities the money to do a better job, so much the better. But not only does this come from the side of politics that never showed any interest whatsoever in what sorts of services we had in rural, regional and remote Australia but this is the side of politics that has opposed every initiative we put in place: 900 mobile phone towers in rural areas rolled out with our assistance to replace what - the old mobile system that you closed down because you did not give a damn about country Australians.</DOC>

 - I have to say that, amidst the MedicarePlus negotiations, I had almost forgotten about Centenary House, so I thank the member for Casey for reminding me of the Centenary House rent rort rip-off. We know what happened under the rent rort rip-off: the Labor Party gets the goldmine; the taxpayers get the shaft. We have the Leader of the Opposition running around here saying that the Centenary House deal is okay because it was cleared by a judicial inquiry. Let us examine precisely what this inquiry said. The key conclusion of the report said:... it is likely that the economic position of the Commonwealth under the terms of the present lease will prove to be little different from what its position would have been had the rent been reviewed to market rates every two years over the full term of the lease.So the Commonwealth was no worse off under the Centenary House deal. That is the key conclusion of the inquiry.Let us consider the reality as we now know it. The Commonwealth are paying $290 a square metre at Barton in the Edmund Barton Building. We are paying $295 a square metre at 3 National Circuit. We are paying $295 a square metre in the Robert Garran Offices. We are paying $395 a square metre - yes, and well may the Minister for Foreign Affairs squirm - in, admittedly, the prestigious R.G. Casey Building. So that is what the Commonwealth are paying. But what are the Commonwealth paying at Centenary House? We are paying $871 per square metre - almost three times as much as we would be paying under a reasonable deal. Let me make it very clear to the Leader of the Opposition: you cannot rely on a report that says the Commonwealth will be no worse off when manifestly we are worse off - very much worse off. It is like relying on yesterday's weather forecast when you know it is wrong.The Leader of the Opposition likes to explain his flip-flops by saying, with Lord Keynes, `When circumstances change, I change my opinion.' The circumstances have changed with Centenary House, and it is high time he changed his opinion. But he does not want to do it because he is too conscious of the $6,721 a day, every single day, that the Labor Party trousers as a result of the rent rort rip-off. The rent rort rip-off is $36 million over the term of the current lease. Because the Leader of the Opposition thinks it is such a good deal, we can be confident that if any future Labor government has the chance the rent rort rip-off will be extended to $74 million by the time a future Labor government has renewed the lease.What do you think a warm and cuddly, sensitive New-Age opposition leader might think about something like this? We know what he thinks, because on 11 December last year, just into his glorious reign as the Leader of the Opposition, he told innocent schoolchildren:Be true to the things you believe in ...	...	...	...You've got to go to bed at night thinking, 'I'm being true to the reasons I got into this in the first place,' ...That is what he said to schoolchildren. I really do not know, and I hate to speculate on, what goes through the mind of the Leader of the Opposition at night, but I am sure that one thing is the $6,721 a day he is pocketing every day that the rent rort rip-off goes on. As long as this deal persists, what are the things that the Leader of the Opposition believes in? He believes in ripping off the taxpayer, defending the indefensible and refusing to accept that circumstances have changed. There is a word for the Leader of the Opposition: he is a fake. And he stays a fake until he renegotiates that lease.</DOC>

 - Can I start by saying, sir, that I think you are very independent and I have enormous regard for you, Mr Speaker. -  - An example of even-handed independence, if I might say so, sir. A great example of it. - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, and I might also remind the Leader of the Opposition that in 1996 I promised to do a number of other things in relation to the parliament. I promised as Prime Minister to turn up at every question time. I did not adopt the attitude that this great and privileged office entitled me to become, as my predecessor assumed it did, some kind of part-time occupant who turned up when the thought struck him and he wanted to feed a few lines to the plebeians, because that was basically the attitude that was taken by my predecessor. I also said that we would allow a lot more questions, and I am very proud of the fact that, over the past eight years, the number of questions asked on average has returned to the levels of the Fraser government years, and is far in excess of the number of questions that were allowed by either of my two Labor predecessors. Once again - and I may be constrained to say - it is another example of: never listen to what Labor say; always have a look at what Labor do. In office, they treat the speakership as some kind of Labor fiefdom - something to be handed around. Out of respect for the office, occupied with such dignity and independence as it is at the present time, I will not go over the record of my predecessors. As for the future, let me inform the Leader of the Opposition that the Leader of the House is always available for discussion with his counterpart about the conduct of affairs in this place.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question, and I know what an enthusiastic supporter of the MedicarePlus package she is. And why shouldn't she be? Under MedicarePlus, the Howard government has invested $2.9 billion in new money to ensure that Medicare remains for all time the universal guarantee of affordable, high-quality health care for all Australians. That is the essence of MedicarePlus.The MedicarePlus safety net is the most important improvement to our health system since Medicare commenced in 1983. It is necessary, it is timely and it is important, because in the real world not everyone is going to be bulk-billed all the time. The world has changed since 1983. Back in those days, health care mostly involved visits to the GP or stays in a public hospital. Today it involves much more use of specialists, out-of-hospital diagnosticians and day proceduralists - and these services have never been widely bulk-billed.For instance, the gap between the Medicare Benefits Schedule and the charge fee in the case of MRIs averages $104; for CT scans it averages $83; for ultrasounds it averages $56; and for specialist consultations it averages $28. It is because of these gaps that the MedicarePlus safety net is absolutely necessary. The MedicarePlus safety net will deliver to 20 million Australians the peace of mind that if they need help it is there for them. It is there for them thanks to the Howard government and MedicarePlus. Every year some 450,000 Australians will benefit from the safety net, but 20 million Australians will benefit from the peace of mind that the safety net brings. I inform the House that the latest figures show that some 33,000 individuals and families have already incurred more than $300 in gap expenses since the beginning of this year. Let me particularly point out to the member for Lalor that only 15 per cent of those expenses arise from GP consultations.So restoring 80 per cent GP bulk-billing is not going to address the problem. Only the Howard government's MedicarePlus safety net can address this problem and ensure that Medicare remains our guarantee of affordable access to high-quality health care. Medicare has never meant universal bulk-billing. It certainly does not mean the kind of universal bulk-billing that the member for Lalor is pretending that she can deliver. What Medicare has always meant is a universal guarantee of affordable high-quality health care, and that is precisely what the Howard government is delivering - and only the Howard government can deliver it.</DOC>

 - I say to the Leader of the Opposition that there has not been a $1 billion cut. I reject that claim completely. There has been no such cut. I have not had an opportunity of reading the Senate report being released today. I have received some briefing on it. I understand the majority report is written according to the views largely of the Labor senators, but there is a minority report. It deals not only with issues of homelessness but also with issues of poverty in the Australian community.I think all Australians recognise that, even though our nation is going through a period of unparalleled national prosperity, there are people in the Australian community who are missing out on that. It is true - to use the vernacular - that the rich have got richer. But it is not true that the poor have got poorer. This is a point that is illustrated time and time again by reference to many surveys that have been carried out and the very fact that there have been 1.3 million more jobs in Australia over the last eight years, the fact that the per capita GDP has risen, the fact that real wages have risen and the fact that benefits for families are substantially better.I quote, for example, the NATSEM research that was commissioned by the Sydney Morning Herald and Age newspapers in 2001, which indicated that families with children had been the big winners under our family assistance scheme. The most interesting finding of this research - and this research was not commissioned by the Liberal Party or by the government; it was commissioned by the two Fairfax broadsheets - was that NATSEM found that the changes to government benefits saw resources poured into poorer families, with some receiving increases of over 75 per cent in government assistance. The result, according to economists who examined the NATSEM data, has been to greatly reduce the numbers of children formerly living in poverty. They are the findings of an independent body.Let me provide the Leader of the Opposition with one specific cameo to illustrate the point, and this compares the situation from January 1996 to July 2003. It speaks of a family with two children aged four and eight years, with one parent fortunately in work earning the federal minimum wage of $23,381 - which, by any measure, is a very low wage. Interestingly, it found that, compared with January 1996, that family was about $88 a week better off in real terms in terms of disposable income. That family was $88 a week better off.  - This is a family that is earning the federal minimum wage, and it is very directly relevant to the work of the Senate inquiry. - It also found that that family was paying almost $4 a week less income tax in real terms and that that family was entitled to receive over $76 a week more in real terms in family assistance payments. If we want to have a debate about poverty -  - By all means let us have a debate about poverty - but let us examine some of the facts. The truth is that, when you examine the social security measures introduced by this government, you see that we have gone to very great pains to make sure that the greatest winners are the poorest in the community. - I am very pleased that I am Prime Minister of a country that has seen -  - a very strong growth in opportunities and real incomes -  - for middle- and upper-income earners. But I am also proud of the fact that that has not been at the expense of social justice for the poor. The figures that I quoted illustrate that very strongly indeed, and I am very proud of those comparisons.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I acknowledge all the work he does in his own electorate on labour market programs and industrial relations issues. The labour force figures for February showed unemployment below six per cent for the sixth month in a row, at 5.9 per cent. They also show that 1,300 new jobs were created in February. There was a fall in full-time jobs of 13,100, offset by a rise in part-time jobs of 14,400. This comes after exceptionally strong rises in full-time jobs over previous months, with 257,000 new full-time jobs being created in the last two years. As I said in question time on Tuesday - I think it was Tuesday - compare that with the last six years of the previous Labor government, where 53,100 full-time jobs were created in six years. In the last six months, 257,000 new jobs were created. That will give you some idea of the dimensions.I should note in passing that there were compositional changes to the labour force figures. The bureau first of all fed in the population from the 2001 census, which was larger and therefore affected the calculation of the rate, and in addition introduced a refinement to the definition of `unemployed' which means that, if you have a job but you are not taking it up for four weeks or less, you are now counted as unemployed. You actually have a job, but you are waiting to take it up. It is estimated that these compositional changes will add about 0.1 per cent to the figures. That could be the explanation of why the figure this month was 5.9 per cent rather than 5.8 per cent. The compositional change would explain all that. I am asked what the factors that lead to low unemployment are. Remember, this is the sixth month where unemployment has been below six per cent. There are essentially two factors. The first is cyclical - that is, unemployment will fall during periods of strong economic growth and will rise during recessions. When Labor put the economy into recession at the end of the 1980s, that was the principal reason Labor put one million people out of work and took unemployment to 10.9 per cent. The first thing that we have to do if we are really worried about those people who are looking for work in Australia is to keep the Australian economy growing.The second factor is what we call a structural factor, which is that at any given point in the cycle, as the cycle moves up or down, if you have a better structure in your labour market the unemployment rate will be lower. It is structural policy that could yield additional results for Australia in terms of getting people back to work. The most important structural change that we could make in Australia to improve job opportunities would be to reform our labour market, to take away the unfair dismissal laws which make employers hiring-averse and to give confidence and flexibility back to wage fixing.I understand that the unfair dismissal laws have now been defeated by the Australian Labor Party on 39 occasions in the Senate. On 39 occasions, the Australian Labor Party has voted against changes which would increase employment in this country. There is no justification for Labor standing in the way of reform which this country needs. We say to the Labor Party: get out of the way and let the structural reform take effect, and let's get more Australians back into work.</DOC>

 - The answer is no for the very simple reason that no money has been taken from public hospitals. We have provided more money to public hospitals; we have provided a 17 per cent real increase. The wage cost index formula to which the member referred was the very formula that the Premier of New South Wales signed up to when he signed the health agreement and knew that he was signing up to. His bleating on that subject is an attempt to divert the attention of the public of New South Wales from the way in which the public hospital system of that state is falling around his ears. The public hospital system in New South Wales is under extreme pressure, not because of lack of federal money but because of the maladministration of the New South Wales Labor government.</DOC>

 - My attention has been drawn to a claim made on radio station 2UE this morning by the Leader of the Opposition, when he said that it was not necessary to amend the Sex Discrimination Act in order to achieve the purposes of the Catholic Education Commission. Specifically, he based that claim on a reference to the so-called `special measures' clauses of the Sex Discrimination Act. Under the subheading `Special measures intended to achieve equality' the special measures clauses say:A person may take special measures for the purpose of achieving substantive equality between: (a) men and women; or - and then it goes on to list other situations which are clearly not relevant to this.Mr Speaker, may I say, through you to the Leader of the Opposition, that the Catholic Education Commission was not seeking substantive equality between men and women on this issue; it was seeking in a commonsense way the permission of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to a proposition that it should offer gender specific scholarships to encourage men into teaching. The issue of the application of section 7D was in fact addressed by the human rights commission when it made its decision. - This is what the Sex Discrimination Commissioner had to say -  - This is what the Sex Discrimination Commissioner had to say in her ruling, the very ruling which has brought about the decision of the government to seek a commonsense amendment to the act:... the Commission doubts whether it could be said that it would be reasonable for the CEO - and she is referring there to the CEO of the education commission - to conclude that the scholarship scheme would further the purpose of achieving substantive equality between those classes of people.I am constrained to say that a plan to provide gender specific scholarships for men could hardly be argued as something seeking substantive equality between men and women. It was designed to help the students of the Catholic schools, not to achieve the substantive equality. The commissioner then goes on to say:In those circumstances, the Commission considers that it would be arguable that section 7D of the Act does not apply to the scholarship scheme on the basis of any substantive inequality said to be suffered by male primary school students.In other words, it was based upon the interests of the students. The only opportunity that was available for the Catholic Education Office was an exemption under section 44. The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition, having run around the country and expressed his concern about male role models, being presented with an opportunity to do something practical, has run away from that. In other words, those who have a zealous commitment to the Sex Discrimination Act have more power in the Labor Party than those concerned about male role models for boys.We on this side of the House stand behind commonsense. We on this side of the House believe that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission should have granted the exemption in the first place. I have to say with all due respect to those placed in authority in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission that it does strike me as odd that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission made the decision it did on this issue, yet on a number of previous occasions exemptions in not entirely dissimilar circumstances have been granted.There have been three exemptions that are similar in concept to the exemption that the government now feels necessary to legislate. In August 1991, HREOC granted an exemption to allow the University College Australian Defence Force Academy to offer a prize for female students completing a postgraduate degree or diploma at the college. In October 1992, HREOC approved an exemption to allow the ANU to offer re-entry scholarships to women wishing to resume academic studies after a significant absence. In March 1993, HREOC granted an exemption to the University of New South Wales to allow them to offer an engineering research award to women to increase the number of women in engineering research and academic positions. Can I say that they were entirely commonsense decisions.What we are doing now is responding to the call of commonsense. Commonsense requires that in a situation such as this the attempt of the Catholic Education Commission to get a few more men into teaching in Catholic schools ought to be accommodated. The human rights commission has ordained that it is contrary to the act. We have to accept that. The only commonsense alternative is to legislate to change the act. We on this side of the House are prepared to do it. It is an exercise in commonsense. Through you, Mr Speaker, I appeal to the Leader of the Opposition to get out of the way and facilitate this commonsense change that will help the cause of providing more male role models to Australian boys.</DOC>

 - All Australians should have access to bulk-billing, and thanks to the MedicarePlus initiative they will. What MedicarePlus delivers to the electorates named is a brand-new safety net, a significant bulk-billing incentive for cardholders and children, work force measures that will mean 1,500 more doctors and 1,600 more nurses in general practice by the year 2007, and patient convenience that means that over time patients will be able to access their Medicare rebate from a surgery without ever having to post in forms or stand in a Medicare queue. This MedicarePlus package delivers substantial benefits to all Australians. If members opposite were really concerned about Medicare and were not obsessed with bulk-billing, they would support the package.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie - he has given a lifetime of commitment to education in particular in the electorate of Macquarie. Today the Prime Minister has announced on behalf of the government a record investment by any Australian government in school education in Australia. $31.3 billion will be invested by this government over the next four years. That represents an $8 billion increase on the preceding four years.It also means that the Australian Catholic Education Commission will receive $12.6 billion and, as the Prime Minister announced with His Eminence Cardinal Pell recently, a $362 million real increase to the 607,000 students in Australia's 1,610 Catholic schools. There will also be a $9.8 billion investment in Australia's government schools, which are primarily funded and run by state governments, and another $7.8 billion will be invested in Australia's 1,043 independent schools. A $2 billion program will be run for literacy and numeracy and students with learning difficulties, in addition to a $1.5 billion investment in the capital infrastructure of Australia's schools.In addition to that, apart from resources the thing that parents want most from education - we are all concerned to know who is teaching our children - is to know that their children can read, write, count and communicate when they finally leave school. We also understand that character, as has been said in the past, is higher than intellect.The government will be requiring state governments and Catholic and independent schools to meet a number of criteria in order to receive this funding. It will be necessary for all state governments to report to parents the results of literacy and numeracy benchmark testing in years 3, 5 and 7. For example, in the state of Queensland one in five boys cannot pass a basic - and I mean basic - year 5 reading test, yet the only people in the state who do not know anything about it are their parents. What we are determined to do is to see in every part of the country that national benchmark testing results in reading, writing and numeracy will be reported to parents.In addition to that, it will be a requirement of the funding that school reports, particularly in primary school, provide plain language information to parents about how their children are actually progressing through the education system. We should not have the situation which exists at Walgett High School where Aboriginal parents - to their disgust, disappointment and dismay - discovered that their children, having got through primary school with so-called good reports, were then barely literate at the age of 15.We will also be requiring schools to report the participation of teachers in ongoing professional development and training. As parents, we also want to know something about absenteeism in schools. We as a government are also determined, preparing young Australians to be Australian and global citizens, to drive national consistency in education. At the moment we have eight different starting ages for school across Australia. By the year 2010, in every part of the country, children will begin school at the same age, and we will have a common testing process for reading and writing, science, information communication technology and civics and democracy. At the moment, when 80,000 school-aged children move from one state to another, their parents feel that they have moved to a different country. This information will be provided to parents through the Internet, newsletters, brochures, annual reports and perhaps signs in schools. Perhaps some schools might even use the signs at the front of their schools to provide this kind of information.The government has also today released a consultation paper for Australian parents to ask parents what they think about and want for life skills in education, basic skills in schooling, reading and writing, attracting good quality teachers into schooling, and what kinds of values they want to inform the education of their children. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. The reality in relation to school funding is that, firstly, state government schools are the primary responsibility of state governments. In fact, 68 per cent of Australia's school students attend state schools and receive in total 76 per cent of all of the public funding. In fact, that is 2.2 million students, and they receive $20 billion in public funding. But the 1.1 million students in the Catholic and independent schools do not get $10 billion - they do not get half of that money; they do not get $9 billion or $8 billion or $7 billion - but get $6.2 billion, and parents pay $4 billion in fees and make sacrifices to send their children there.In fact, the Labor Party obviously has difficulty with learning this particular message. The last time the member for Jagajaga asked me a question, she asked me about a fact sheet, and I would like to refer to another fact sheet. This particular fact sheet, by Brother Kelvin Canavan, Executive Director of Schools in the Archdiocese of Sydney, says:To get the full story about how governments fund schools you need to take into account both Federal and State funding as well as contributions from parents.In other words, the Catholic Education Commission and every educated person in the education sector is reminding the member for Jagajaga of the facts in relation to school funding. Today, the government announces a $31.3 billion program to fund Australia's schools for the next four years -  - and there are 1,043 independent schools in the sector. So what does the member for Jagajaga do? She goes to the list. She goes to the 1,043 schools and she is looking for the King's School. She starts at No. 1, which is Southside east Education Centre in Sunnybank; No. 2, Eastside Christian School in Lindisfarne, $2,264; North West Christian School in Penguin, Tasmania, $2,231. She gets on to page 2, then page 3, page 4, page 5, page 11, page 22 and goes on and on. She finally gets to page 48, to school No. 861, and she finally finds the King's School. Let us be clear about it: inherent in the question is the argument that the Labor Party will be cutting money to this school and every school from No. 861 to No. 1043. That is what is behind the question. Our idea is that at the end of 2008, four years from now, these students will have received an additional $740 per student above and beyond what they get now.So what comes after school No. 861? Let us have a look at that. No. 868 is the Lowther Hall Anglican Grammar School. Under Labor, they are going to lose money. Then we go to the Esperance Christian Primary School in the electorate of Kalgoorlie, which is No. 886. They are going to lose money. Then we have the Byron Community Primary School. They are going to lose money under Labor. Then we go to the Perth Montessori School in Victoria Park. They will be losing money under Labor. What the Labor Party has discovered from this document which I have released today is that we started with the poorest schools getting the largest increases and the last school was the school that was getting the least increase.No. 971 is the Aboriginal Community College at Gnangara and it is going to lose money under Labor. I would also add that Labor's hit list includes the Calvary Christian School in Hamilton Hill. What have those 59 students and their parents done to upset the Labor Party? The fact is that, under our scheme, every student in this country will receive support according to the means of the family from which they come. The question that Australian families ask is: why is the Labor Party against you sending your son or daughter to a non-government Catholic or independent school? - Yes. - I am very happy to table it. It has been published. It is on our departmental web site.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I would like to begin by congratulating the Minister for Health and Ageing on the magnificent work he has put in. While I am at it, I thank the provider as well. It is much appreciated. I see that the package is now being described as MedicarePlus-plus. Who called it MedicarePlus-plus? Dr Sue Page, President of the Rural Doctors Association, did on the AM program this morning. She went on to say that the feedback was that the package will make a real difference to bulk-billing rates in regional Australia because it recognises the increased cost of providing health care in rural and regional communities. Indeed, the new $7.50 incentive payments for bulk-billed GP consultations for children under 16 and concession card holders in regional areas recognise the significant extra costs of providing medical services in the bush. Dr Page said, `An initial response from our membership indicates that these measures are likely to make a significant difference to bulk-billing.' For the first time, in addition to the increased incentive payment recognising the higher cost of providing those services in regional areas, there will be an MBS item for allied health services delivered for and on behalf of a GP as part of an endorsed health care plan. That is going to be very important to people, particularly in remote and isolated communities. Coupled with it is the provision that, where dental problems are exacerbating chronic medical conditions, a further MBS item will be available for up to three dental consultations. These measures will be coupled with the safety net. The safety net is very important. I cannot for the life of me understand why the Leader of the Opposition baulked at it. What on earth he thought he was ever going to gain electorally by opposing something as important and as beneficial to people as a safety net is beyond comprehension. These measures together unquestionably represent - and again I quote Dr Sue Page - `a great leap forward for rural doctors and for rural communities'.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I wish he would ask more, just like I wish the press would publish every single bit of the puerile drivel that he puts out as telecommunications policy. I really do. Let me come first of all to the - shock, horror! - leaked document. It always pays to be a little circumspect when they raise these sorts of claims in this place. He quoted from six pages of a 17-page document. That is pretty selective. -  - When you check with Telstra, it emerges that Telstra rejects any suggestion that faults have arisen because of network deterioration or declining staff numbers. It states quite clearly that bad weather caused the problem -  - Thank you for that. We have from the member for Hotham a laugh which reflects that he does not understand that the weather has a huge impact on the reliability of telecommunications in regional areas. -  - It does. Here is a personal invitation: come out to Gwydir with me and see some of the terrain that these lines have to cover, and you will recognise that a flood does actually create a problem. The test is how quickly they fix it. - I reiterate that floods and lightning strikes, for example, can lead to breakdowns. It is as simple as that. The question then becomes how quickly repairs are made, and Telstra has already committed additional funding to address the problem. What the member for Melbourne asked in his question and invited us to do was to effectively join Labor in his policy. His policy, of course, is to micromanage Telstra in a way that would see Telstra told what it could invest in, what business sectors it could be involved in and how many people it should employ - in short, he wants to take over the running of Telstra again. There is a problem in doing that, and it is pretty basic - and this is why I wish that his apologies for policies that he releases in his press statements every other day were more widely published - and it is that to do that he needs to first recognise that it was Labor who corporatised Telstra and, in the case of a corporatisation like that, you cannot instruct the board or interfere with its responsibilities and act against the interests of shareholders.In reality - I do not know whether the people behind the member for Melbourne know it - the opposition spokesman's proposition is that Telstra should be decorporatised. He wants to turn it back into the old publicly run PMG. The Treasurer should really add that to the unfunded promises - that is about $30 billion - because you will have to buy out the Telstra shareholders. Since this is old Labor, and old Labor is plainly winning, when you have finished with Telstra, you can go back to Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question and I acknowledge her deep and abiding interest in health and aged care issues. In congratulating the Minister for Health and Ageing on the $2.85 billion package which will protect and strengthen Medicare, I can confirm to the member for Makin that it will greatly benefit older Australians needing health care. Over 90 per cent of pension aged Australians hold some form of concession card. MedicarePlus is increasing incentives to doctors to bulk-bill concession card holders in rural and remote areas, in metropolitan areas and in Tasmania, which has the oldest aged demographic of any of our states.Over two million Australians of pension age eligible for concession cards will benefit. Specifically, older Australians with concession cards will have 80 per cent of their out-of-pocket expenses for medical services outside hospitals covered once the annual threshold of $300 per individual or family is reached. The small percentage of older Australians who are not eligible for some sort of concession card will also be covered once the threshold reaches $700 per individual or family. It is a fact that the services that generate a high out-of-pocket expense level tend to be specialist consultations. It is a fact that older Australians tend to use these services at a higher rate than the rest of the population. More than 80 per cent of the illness burden in Australia is caused by chronic conditions, and these are more prevalent in people over the age of 55. So older Australians suffering from chronic conditions will benefit from the allied health and dental health MBS measures. These measures will build on the new initiatives that we announced last year under MedicarePlus, which were specifically targeted to improving access to GP care for residents in aged care facilities - specifically, a new MBS item for comprehensive medical assessments in residential aged care facilities and grants to GPs to work more effectively with aged care facilities.The contrast between the government and the opposition could not be more stark than in our respective approaches to caring for older Australians. The government has a vision for older Australians needing care - high-quality, affordable, accessible care - and that is evidenced by the fact that we have increased funding in aged care from $3 billion to $6 billion. It is evidenced by the fact that we have released 55,600 new aged care places across Australia, and we will fulfil the aspirations of Australians who want to age at home in the community by increasing funding for community aged care packages by over 820 per cent for community aged care packages. Just contrast that with Labor: it neglected aged care when it was in office. There was a 10,000-bed deficit. It was underfunded and ignored. Nothing has changed: no policies; not even a thought bubble on aged care. Labor just does not care.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question and remind him and the House of the good news again today that, for the sixth month in a row, Australia's unemployment rate is below six per cent. This has come about because of two fundamental priorities of this government: firstly, the good economic management that this government has brought to the Australian economy and, secondly, the series of workplace reforms which have brought about more flexibility in the Australian work force. The member for Blair asked me about any alternatives to that. Those alternatives are precisely the Australian Labor Party's policy to take Australian workplaces backwards. It will do this by a heavy-handed regulatory approach which will cost jobs, attack casual employment, attack independent contractors and abolish Australian workplace agreements. One may ask: why is this being done? Simply because the unions have donated some $40 million to the Australian Labor Party and now are seeking a return payment for that money. As small business has said, small businesses throughout Australia should be afraid - very afraid - of the Australian Labor Party's propositions in this regard.So it was interesting when this document dropped into my hands recently. This document is a summary of the amendments and resolutions endorsed at the recent Labor Party conference - a document that has yet to see the light of day through any official Labor Party source. It is a little like the document that the Treasurer came across on the secret tax plans of the Australian Labor Party. We now have this document, which the Labor Party have hidden until now, on the resolutions from their conference. This document shows, contrary to what the Labor Party have been saying, that, for example, a long service portability tax is on the Australian Labor Party's agenda - another way in which small business right throughout Australia will be slugged should the Labor Party ever be elected to government.This document also shows that the Australian Labor Party want to go back to their unfair dismissal laws. The Australian Labor Party want to say to business, both big and small, right throughout Australia: `Should we ever be elected to government don't bother applying for government contracts unless you have a unionised work force.' All of this is in this document from the Australian Labor Party. It also indicates that it will give unprecedented rights to union officials throughout Australia to put their foot in the door of small businesses, every inch and every breadth of this land, under the guise of employee entitlements - something, I note in passing, that the Australian Labor Party failed to provide to workers of Australia for 13 years. This government, by contrast, has paid out some $500 million in employee entitlements, which is something the Labor Party failed to do.I note that, in the document, the Labor Party even admit that there will be additional cost burdens placed on employees - an admission in their own document that there will be additional cost burdens placed on employees - this, of course, being dictated to them by the very union bosses who have donated $40 million to the Australian Labor Party. This is not just hollow rhetoric; this is a Labor Party document and we know that it is binding on all members of the Labor Party. The Leader of the Opposition himself said that once the platform is adopted it is binding on everyone in the party - from the new greenhorn recruit out in the branches of my electorate right through to the federal parliamentary leader. These are resolutions which are binding - resolutions which, if the Labor Party were elected to government, they would enact and slug small business with right throughout Australia.What we see here is a Leader of the Opposition who once said that union bosses were industrial dinosaurs, but he is now taking his instructions from those same union bosses. We see a Leader of the Opposition who just three weeks ago talked about greater flexibility in the work force, yet he is endorsing a Labor Party plan to do the very opposite. We see a Leader of the Opposition who says there is a `crisis of masculinity', yet when presented with the opportunity to do something about it he walks away from it. We see a Leader of the Opposition who talks about ethics in politics, yet he is presiding over a $36 million rort where the Australian taxpayers are providing $36 million to the Australian Labor Party. - The lesson of all of this is: do not listen to what the Leader of the Opposition says; look at what the Labor Party do and what they will do. That is the lesson out of this document and these other incidents. This document proves that the Australian Labor Party is bad for business, is bad for jobs, is bad for workers and is bad for Australia. I table it.</DOC>

Having said that, I am aware of the reports that Radio National is about to be axed. The ABC has advised me that there is absolutely nothing in those reports. In fact, the Director of Radio, Sue Howard, described them as outrageous.

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson. I know that people in her electorate are impressed with the representation she provides for them, including her representation on these issues. I am sure the honourable member would be appalled to hear that the global trade in people-smuggling, which is a massive trade, is estimated to be worth somewhere in the vicinity of $15 billion to $20 billion a year, with an estimated four million people smuggled every year. It is important to understand that people-smuggling is run by hardened criminals - syndicates. These are people who have no regard for human life or human rights; they are in this game just to make money. It is a lucrative trade - there is high demand. That means that the most effective tool you have to stop it is deterrence.As one of those countries which are targeted by people smugglers, we have to have in place a policy that deters people from being brought illegally to Australia. That is why we have offshore processing and that is why we have had the policy of excision. It also explains why we have the Royal Australian Navy patrolling our maritime borders, particularly to the north and north-west. It also explains why we have a policy of turning boats back where it is practical, making sure people do not land in Australia in the first place. Once they land, the people smugglers have got their way and can sell their success to future clients.I was asked whether there are any alternative views. I was asked a similar question yesterday about the Labor Party's approach. As we know, the Labor Party wants to get rid of offshore processing and excision. It wants to scrap the Navy from the patrolling of our maritime borders for the purposes of stopping people-smuggling. It will not turn people back; it will allow people to land here in Australia. It does have alternatives, and I mentioned to the House yesterday that its alternatives are three coast guide motor boats that will bring the people into Australia, 10 water taxis and a couple of helicopters with snipers on them. I said that the Labor Party spokesman, the member for Barton, had told the Sydney Morning Herald that the Labor Party would spend $32 million over four years to buy the 10 water taxis.I must admit that I reflected on that for a bit, because I do not know quite how far $32 million for 10 water taxis would go. I got my office to get in touch with the Department of Defence and Customs to see what you could get for $32 million. The $32 million is over four years, so that would be $8 million a year. You would not have a lot of crew on each water taxi, so I made the most reasonable of assumptions: you would have two crew per water taxi, because they are only water taxis. But remember - this is according to the Labor Party's own costings document - those two crew would cost $2½ million a year for the 10 water taxis. Whoops! We have only got $5½ million a year and all we have got is two crew per water taxi. I was wondering how much it would cost to run a water taxi. You would have to buy fuel for it, it would depreciate and you would need spare parts and so on -  - The Treasurer asks whether you would have to pay a fare; I can assure you that by the time I get to the end of this you will see why you do have to pay a fare if you are an illegal migrant - to make the costs add up!The cheapest boat the Australian Customs Service have run in recent times was a 15-metre boat, and this boat cost $1 million a year to run. That is for one boat. So what do we have here? We have $1 million and two crew. What are the two crew doing? One is driving the water taxi and I assume the other one is looking around for illegal migrants and talking on the phone to the helicopter pilot and the sniper. That is it. That is the end. That is all there is! We have got the money now for maintenance - we have got some diesel, oil and grease. We are in the red, by the way; we have gone over our $8 million a year. The one thing we have not got so far is the water taxi itself. There is no money for the actual purchase of the water taxi, but there is money for the two crew and, of course, there is money for a bit of diesel and equipment.Do not get me wrong, Mr Speaker. This policy could work but I think it is highly unlikely. The tragedy of this policy, of course, is that it is completely risible; obviously the figures do not add up. It makes an utter mockery of the Australian Labor Party to be putting forward such nonsense. But behind the understandable ridicule, you have to appreciate, is a very serious issue, and that is that we have to stop these people smugglers and these people-smuggling syndicates and we have to be tough about it. This policy obviously does not work. It is obviously a complete fraud. It does sum up the style of the Leader of the Opposition, which is all about symbols. It is all about getting out there with the Dick Morris symbols. But there is no substance behind the symbols. The problem for the Labor Party is that this kind of policy that has been put forward - the policy of the coast guides, the water taxis and the snipers in the sky - insults the intelligence of the Australian public, and the public are gradually becoming wise to the triumph of symbolism over substance in the opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lingiari for his question because, stripped of the bluster, there is a serious problem and it does need to be addressed. But I would certainly reject any suggestion that this government is complacent. We are now spending $250 million a year on Indigenous specific health projects. That is a 100 per cent real increase on what was being spent in 1996. I do not blame the former Labor government for its comparatively low spending. I just say that the Howard government has done more and will continue to do more because this is a very serious national issue. I accept that, on most of the indicators, Indigenous Australians' health is very poor. I accept that. There is some good news. The communicable diseases, which were once almost pandemic in Indigenous communities, have almost been wiped out. In addition, infant mortality in Indigenous communities, which was once 150 per 1,000 births - an absolute disaster for all of us - has now been reduced to just 15 per 1,000 births. It is still too high. It is still almost double the national average but, nevertheless, it is getting better thanks in part to the good work of the Howard government, which will continue.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Pearce for her question. Let me point out to the House that every day the rort goes on and every day the fleece metre ticks up by $6,721 so that by the end of the current term of the Centenary House rent rort rip-off it will be $36 million, and it will be $74 million if the Leader of the Opposition ever has a chance to renew the lease.What does the rent rort mean? It means that Labor get the goldmine and taxpayers get the shaft. We all know that, compared to the rents paid by government departments in the Barton area, the Centenary House deal is a rip-off. Compared to the rents paid for prime office real estate in the most expensive cities in the world, it is still a rip-off. Prime office space in Hong Kong costs $607 a square metre; prime office space in Washington DC, $682 a square metre; prime office space in Seoul, $745 a square metre; prime office space in midtown Manhattan, $749 a square metre; prime office space in Geneva, where diplomats drive up the price, $798 a square metre; and Centenary House, the daddy of them all and the most expensive real estate in the world, $871 a square metre. My source is the CB Richard Ellis publication The 50 Most Expensive Office Locations in the World. There is Hong Kong, there is Washington, there is Seoul, there is midtown Manhattan, there is Geneva, there is Rome and there is Barton. Thanks to the Labor Party, the Australian taxpayer is paying more for a nondescript office in suburban Canberra than people are paying for the most expensive real estate in the world. Just to help members opposite, I will table Labor's rent rip-off.Today I thought: `Just what do people get for their money in all of these expensive locations?' So I went to the Internet to find out what your rent would buy you in downtown New York. I found this:The 101 Park Avenue Building systems are state-of-the-art and meticulously maintained. With a parking garage, bank, full service, newsstand, restaurant, private dining room offering immaculate service and discreet privacy, concierge and white-gloved elevator attendants, tenants' needs have been anticipated and exceeded.You would expect to pay a lot for that kind of service, and you do. That is $931 a square metre, just exceeding the current rent of $871 a square metre in Barton. But, come September this year, the nine per cent ratchet clause will take effect and the ALP will be getting $949 a square metre, which is more than you would pay for 101 Park Avenue in New York.We have seen quite a few backflips from the member for Werriwa since he became the Leader of the Opposition. He supported gay marriage and then he did not. He supported selling Kirribilli House and then he did not. He supported euthanasia and now he is not so sure. He thought George Bush was flaky and dangerous and now he reckons he is his best mate. He was going to deregulate higher education and now he is not. I say to the political acrobat opposite: please, just one more backflip! This is the real test, is it not, for the Leader of the Opposition. What is more important - the $6,721 he is trousering every day or his alleged commitment to ethics in politics? I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to prove that he is a real leader and not just a politically correct poseur by ending the rent rort rip-off now.</DOC>

 - While I will perhaps not say I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question, not surprisingly the Leader of the Opposition has asked me a question on this matter and I will take a moment to reply. Could I start by saying that, as both the Leader of the Opposition and I said in our remarks a few moments ago, the Madrid attack has been a brutal reminder that all nations, irrespective of their stance on particular issues, are vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Madrid is another warning to Australia that it could happen here. Madrid in Spain has now joined Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Turkey and the Philippines as countries that have seen terrorist attacks on their soil in the past 12 months. In addition, there is of course Iraq. These attacks have, as I noted earlier, taken the lives of many hundreds of people without regard to their race, their nationality, their religion or their political beliefs.As I know the Leader of the Opposition would appreciate, particularly at a time of greater focus on security issues, not only is there regular contact between my office, my department and the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police but there is also extensive communication and collaboration between relevant agencies concerned with intelligence and security matters. Such contact is of necessity confidential. There were discussions last week between me, my chief of staff, the secretary of my department and the commissioner. Those discussions arose from the commissioner's interview on Channel 9 on Sunday, 14 March 2004. There was nothing at all improper about those discussions. They respected fully the operational role and the independence of the Australian Federal Police. The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police continues to enjoy the full confidence of the government. Under his leadership the Australian Federal Police have shown great professional competence. This was particularly the case in the investigations which followed the Bali attack.It remains the government's view that Australia was a terrorist target before we joined military operations in Iraq. Immediately prior to the war in Iraq the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation advised the government that, in the absence of specific and credible evidence, Australia's involvement would not warrant a raising of the overall threat level in Australia. Threat levels in respect of some foreign interests in Australia were raised and so too in respect of some Australian interests overseas, especially in the Middle East. I put this on the public record here in parliament almost a year ago, on 24 March 2003. This is why at the time of the Iraq war the overall threat level in Australia was not lifted. At no time - and I stress this to the House - since the conclusion of the war in Iraq has the government received any contrary advice from any relevant agency. The Director-General of ASIO said last week:... we ... know that al-Qaida had an active interest in carrying out a terrorist attack in Australia well before 11 September and that we remain a target.ASIO has informed the government that there is intelligence that Australia was a potential terrorist target before 11 September 2001. In 2001 a planned attack on our high commission in Singapore was uncovered. On 3 November 2001 bin Laden made reference to Australian involvement in East Timor. The Bali attack took place months before the war in Iraq. Whatever the causes of terrorism and whatever rationalisations terrorists may seek to ascribe to individual acts of terrorism for propaganda purposes, the reality of dealing with terrorism remains the focus of my government's attention. I hope that I speak for all members of the House in declaring again that Australia will never be intimidated into altering its attitude on any issue by threats of terrorism. - Yes. - It is marked `confidential'.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. I also express my sympathy to the Spanish people, to the families of the 202 who died and to those who were injured. More than 1,750 have now been reported as having been injured. It is not clear but it is now more likely, we think, that these attacks were the work of Islamic extremists with links to al-Qaeda. In answer to the honourable member's question, I think it is very important that we all understand what the objectives of al-Qaeda and its South-East Asian variant, Jemaah Islamiah, really are. These are organisations which are trying to overthrow the moderate Islamic governments of the world - governments in our own region, in Indonesia, Malaysia, the southern part of Thailand, the southern part of the Philippines and Brunei. These are parts of the world they want to turn into fundamentalist Taliban style regimes. They want to do the same thing in the Islamic Middle East.These organisations have been driven for a long time to achieve these objectives. They have mounted terrorist attacks for a long time in order to try to achieve these objectives. We have to defeat these organisations. I mean `we' broadly: Australia and our friends and allies. Very importantly, included in `we' are the moderate Islamic countries of our region and of the Middle East - and that is most of them. We all have to defeat these terrorists, and we have to unite and work together in order to do that. There is no doubt that these organisations will use any manner of arguments. They have focused very much on the Israeli-Palestinian dispute as a way of building support for their cause in the Islamic world. They have focused on Iraq, as we have been discussing. They have focused on East Timor. They have focused on a lot of different issues. But never lose sight of what their fundamental raison d'etre is: to establish fundamental, transnational, Taliban style Islamic regimes throughout the Islamic world. Amongst their enemies are what they perceive to be the apostate, moderate governments of Islam and the Western world, which they rather rudely describe as `infidels'. I make the point that we have to work together as a region and we have to work together as a world to deal with this.On 4 and 5 February - just over a month ago - Hasan Wirayuda, the foreign minister of Indonesia, and I co-chaired a regional counter-terrorism summit. We brought together ministers from 25 countries. Foreign ministers, law enforcement ministers and US Attorney General Ashcroft were there. We took quite clear decisions to enhance the cooperation around the region to counter the problem of terrorism. This was building on the nine memoranda of understanding we have with countries in our region, from India right through to Fiji and especially in South-East Asia, to enhance the cooperation between our police, between our intelligence agencies and between our diplomats. No doubt the work is never done sufficiently, but we certainly made a great deal of progress in terms of how we are addressing this problem.As the Prime Minister said, in the end, as an international community - and I do not just mean Australia as a country; I mean the international community - we cannot afford to show weakness in the face of terrorists. We have to show enormous resolve and determination to defeat these people. We must not allow ourselves to become divided. We have to unite as an international community to fight this terrorism. I do not think the international community faces a tougher or more important task than to be united in its fight against terrorism, not to waiver, not to be weak and, above all, not to allow itself to be frightened out of dealing with terrorists by threats and blackmail. We should never allow that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for his question and for his interest. I know that his question reflects the interest of his constituents in this issue. The Australian government was right to take action against Iraq's persistent breaches of Security Council resolutions - in particular, the Security Council resolution 1441 that was passed unanimously in November of 2002. Military action was the only way of ensuring that Saddam's regime was disarmed, as the former head of the Iraq Survey Group David Kay has made perfectly clear. To quote Dr Kay, who was the head of the Iraq Survey Group until fairly recently, the Iraq Survey Group `learned things that no UN inspector would have ever learned given the terror regime of Saddam'. He went on to say, `Iraq was in clear material violation of United Nations Security Council resolution 1441.'We are proud of the role we played in removing a brutal dictator - a man who we have discovered was responsible for some 270 mass graves containing between 300,000 and 400,000 remains; a man who sponsored terrorist organisations like the Mujaheddin-e Khalq and the Palestinian Liberation Front. Many members will be aware that Saddam Hussein's regime used to provide $US25,000 to the families of suicide bombers.Those who think it was a mistake to overthrow the regime of Saddam Hussein must consider what the alternative reality would heave been. His regime would have still been in power with its record of torture, rape rooms and murder, with his pursuit of weapons of mass destruction - the fact that he had used these weapons against his own people, the fact that he obviously maintained weapons of mass destruction activities when they were barred by the United Nations Security Council. I do not think we would have secured the counterproliferation achievements that have been achieved in relation to Libya's abandonment of weapons of mass destruction, nor Iran and North Korea's increased cooperation with the international community.Let me also say, for those who support the American alliance, a strong international voice in the world, a backdown in early 2003 would have, of course, substantially weakened the authority and credibility of America and its allies. But, more than that, it would have weakened the United Nations very substantially. It would have shown that United Nations Security Council resolutions - including chapter 7 resolutions, which are mandatory resolutions - were but debating points and nothing more.As I said, this government is proud of the role Australia and our defence forces played in the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime. There will be much debate about this, no doubt, in Australia and the international community from now until the end of time. I think that, ultimately, there is one group of people whose views ought to be taken into account over and above our own. Those people are the people of Iraq. I do not think we should ignore them. And I think it is worth reflecting that not only are Iraqis glad to see the back of Saddam Hussein's regime but a recent opinion poll commissioned by the BBC and conducted by Oxford Research International found that 70 per cent of Iraqis are optimistic that life is going to improve for them over the next year. Whatever we think in this country and whatever we say in this country, whatever arguments we may put in this country, let us not forget that the people who will be the ultimate arbiters of this issue - the Iraqi people themselves - are overwhelmingly delighted that we got rid of that brutal dictator and they look to the future with an optimism that they could never have had under the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein.</DOC>

 - The Australian people have a perfect right to know of the security assessments that have come to this government regarding the threat levels to this country and to its people in the wake of certain international events, and at no stage have I disguised or held back on those pieces of advice. What the Leader of the Opposition appears to miss, and what some others appear to miss, is that at no stage over the last 12 months have we received advice from any of the relevant agencies suggesting that the threat levels to this country have changed as a consequence of our involvement in Iraq. - In relation to the issue of the bombings in Spain, the reality is that at this stage it appears that those responsible are those referred to in the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Beyond that, it is too early to make firm conclusions. I have not received any advice on altering threat levels to this country in consequence of what occurred in Madrid, in Spain. The Leader of the Opposition is perfectly entitled and perfectly correct to exhort me to share with the Australian people the advice about threat levels that I receive in my capacity as Prime Minister, and I have done that. This is what the Leader of the Opposition does not like, because the advice that we have had from all of the relevant agencies over the last year has not altered the statement I made to this parliament on 24 March 2003. I will always share with the Australian people the advice regarding potential threats, and nothing that I have done in relation to this matter has in any way qualified that commitment.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question and note his interest in Portland. The government has been proactive for a long time on maritime security and in the fight against the possibility that terrorists might use ships as vessels in their evil objectives. Customs is operating its shipping container X-ray facilities. There are significantly tightened crewing identification arrangements: crew lists must now be received 48 hours ahead of any ship arriving in Australia. There has been the creation of the Office of Transport Security and the Transport Security Operations Centre, which are well funded by the Commonwealth government, and we are using increased intelligence to identify and thwart potential risks.In addition, we are leading the way in implementing the new maritime security protocols - the ISPS Code, as it is known - and actively pursuing internationally the development of the international framework, the Ship and Port Facility Security Code, which we aim to have in place by 1 July this year. Legislation passed through this place last year. The regulations are in place. We have received over 90 per cent - and this reflects very well on industry; we thank them for their cooperation - of all maritime plans from port operators and ships. That is some 300 plans covering our 70 ports and the Australian shipping fleet. I note that this morning the Portland CEO, from the member for Wannon's own electorate, stated on ABC Radio that Portland will have its plan up and running by July and that he is not at all surprised by the announcement of a review, as the ports have been working on security for some time. I should mention that Australia is also helping our Asia-Pacific neighbours to meet their requirements.Yesterday I announced that the Secretaries Committee on National Security will also conduct an up-to-the-moment and overarching review of maritime security in Australia. We take this very seriously indeed. We are - and I say this with total conviction - one of the world leaders in transport security, but this review will identify any weak links in the chain and anything else that we need to address. It will draw on the international experience to pick up anything that might advantageously be used to better protect our ships and our ports and ships visiting our ports. We need to make certain that we are all the time responding to intelligence, new information, and new technologies and procedures as they become available.I am asked about alternative approaches. I note that the opposition's homeland security spokesman has had a few things to say. He thinks that we have done nothing on maritime security - that is the first thing he said yesterday - but he did not check with his transport spokesman. - The member for Hotham groans at the thought that the shadow minister for homeland security should have consulted with the member for Batman. He groans. He thinks the member for Batman might not have done his work. Of course, on this one, the transport spokesman over there knows very well what the government has been doing. He stood in here when we passed the legislation and went to some lengths to say that he actually thought we had done a good job and that the pulling of all of this together was an example of the parliament working well for the advantage and safety of the Australian people. That is what the member for Batman said some months ago, but unfortunately the shadow minister, who is the spokesman for homeland security, had not checked. He went on to say that their proposed coastguard would be of great value in combating terrorism.Yesterday, in response to a question about that, I referred to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who calls it a `coast guide'. I made the observation that, if I were a terrorist intent on doing something evil in Australia, I would far rather be intercepted by Labor's `coast guide' - a water taxi with a couple of .303s up on the poop deck - than by the Australian Navy. I would far rather be confronted by Labor's `coast guide' than by the Australian Navy - well equipped and well resourced, with men and women able to tackle the situation.But this did prompt me to go and have a look to see just what Labor's maritime security policy was. The first thing that seemed logical to check was just what this `coast guide' was actually for. The platform tells us that the `coast guide' is to guard against these things: transnational organised crime, drug-running, gun-running and illegal fishing. Maritime terrorism is not mentioned. And when you search a little more widely you find that Labor's platform not only does not contain any measures to address maritime terrorism; it does not even address the possibility that the threat might exist.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson for her question. The member for McPherson has been very interested in these issues over a considerable period, and given the nature of her electorate the question is of special significance. Of course, protecting the integrity of our borders remains a continuing and high priority for this government. - The number of boats attempting to reach our shores with unauthorised entrants has dropped to an almost insignificant number in the last three years. There are other aspects to border protection, including issues relating to drugs. The number of drug seizures that have occurred has resulted in a massive reduction of the supply of illicit drugs to the Australian market and, according to a survey under the national drug strategy in 2001, there were 23 per cent fewer Australians using illicit drugs. Since the launch of our Tough on Drugs strategy, Australian law enforcement agencies have stopped more than nine tonnes of serious illicit drugs from reaching Australia's shores.I am very much aware of proposals that impact upon our border security and particularly our capacity to deal with unauthorised border arrivals and drugs. Therefore I am surprised when I see proposals from Labor to set up a coastguard, drawing largely from resources of existing services but also having a policy of bringing unauthorised arrivals into the migration zone - something that I have noted is a `meet and greet' policy. A coastguard with 13 patrol boats and using snipers in helicopters to shoot out outboard motors on boats attempting to breach our border security ought to be seen for what it is. It is a cheap take from the United States, where it is used to stop high-speed motorboats used by Colombian drug cartels from shipping narcotics into the United States. These boats are referred to as `cigarette' boats or `go-fast' boats because of their shape, and they have a speed of up to 50 knots. I am asked whether we have ever seen these sorts of vessels being used to smuggle drugs or people into Australia. The advice I have is that no such vessels have been used to smuggle drugs or people into Australia.The vessels that we see are generally wooden fishing boats. On a good day they may reach five knots. The people smugglers instruct their passengers, if they are apprehended, to sabotage their motors so that the vessels cannot return those people to where they have come from. In fact, one of the major factors that has enabled us to deter people smugglers and people-smuggling operations is the fact that we have been able to secure vessels that have not had their motors damaged and have been able to ensure that they return to where they have come from.So what do we have? We have the Labor Party now with a `meet and greet' organisation - the `coast guide' - who also want to emulate Miami Vice and shoot out the engines of the boats coming to Australia. That is shooting out the engines of boats that move at about five knots an hour and are possibly carrying women and children. Now you do not need the smugglers telling people that they have to sabotage their boats; they can rely upon the Labor Party and their sharpshooters to do it for them.</DOC>

 - I have already indicated that there were discussions. I have already indicated that there is nothing unusual about that. The Leader of the Opposition carries on as if there is something extraordinary about communication between a Prime Minister's office and the office of the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that the commissioner has stood by the statement, the commissioner is totally supportive of the statement, it was the commissioner's statement. It would not have been issued without there being not only a statement that the commissioner believed correctly represented the facts -  - but a statement that he has subsequently fully supported. The Leader of the Opposition refers to it as a clarifying statement. I point out to the Leader of the Opposition that on the Sunday evening of the day of the commissioner's interview, which was 14 March 2004, the Channel 9 news bulletin in Sydney - which is the most widely watched news bulletin anywhere in Australia - carried this comment by the newsreader Mark Burrows:... other allies, that includes Australia. Put another way, our top cop believes our involvement in the Iraq war has made us a possible al-Qaeda target.Our top cop did not say that on the Channel 9 program when he was being interviewed, and that is an illustration of why clarification was needed. -  - The reality is, as the Leader of the Opposition himself knows, because he said in an interview that he thinks there has been a risk since 11 September - and it is a new world - that that claim attributed to the Commissioner of the Federal Police by that newsreader was wrong, and that alone is reason why a clarifying statement was necessary.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. I congratulate him on his wonderful news, which I believe he is going to announce shortly, if he has not done so already. I take this opportunity to congratulate him in the House. I have actually been referred to some recent announcements in relation to retirement incomes and age pensions. On 15 March, in a speech to the Investment and Financial Services Association, the member for Werriwa brought down his long awaited statement on superannuation reform.  - On cue the member for Melbourne comes in and tells us what a wonderful response it got. It contained the largest financial gaffe in Australian history. Not only in the speech but also in the policy, Labor made this commitment: `a commitment to ensure the basic government age pension does not fall below 25 per cent of male average weekly ordinary time earnings'. That was a commitment to the pensioners of Australia of an 11 per cent increase in the age pension, costing the Commonwealth $8 billion over the forward estimates. I want to table that policy and have it on the parliamentary record, because if you go to the ALP web site today they have airbrushed it out of their policy. I want to also table the speech that was given by the Leader of the Opposition, because if you go to the web site the old airbrush has been at it again and it is not in the statement. It was the largest financial gaffe in Australian history, costing $8 billion.During the week, we watched the member for Werriwa wriggle and wriggle and squirm as to how it was that he was so economically incompetent as to make an $8 billion unfunded promise which he did not even realise he was making. His first response was to actually blame the messenger. He went on Sea FM with Kim Geale and Dave Noonan and said: Oh, we just had the wrong technical term in there. That was corrected as soon as it was drawn to our attention. I think, as ever, Mr Costello is grossly exaggerating. So it was all my fault! It was not the fault of the super blooper; it was the fault of the party pooper. An $8 billion error and it is my fault for actually discovering it - silly old me! Then he went on 3AW with Neil Mitchell, where Neil Mitchell said: There is no excuse for a budgetary announcement with an $8 billion mistake.Latham: But there weren't dollars involved. That's the point. There weren't dollars involved. Mitchell: If that policy stood, it was $8 billion wrong.  Latham: Yeah, well, it didn't stand because it was wrong and we fixed it up.Who fixed it up? If it had not been for the government, which bothers to actually read the policies of the Australian Labor Party, it would not have been fixed up. As it turns out, it is not actually the job of this government to be fixing the errors of the opposition. I will take responsibility for this if you send me your policies before you announce them in future. I make an open offer to fix Labor's error if they send the policies around before announcement.I want to point this out to the House: the member for Werriwa came to this place because his predecessor as Treasurer was unable to say what GOS stood for in a press conference. In those days, when the Labor Party had economic credibility, if somebody like the member for Werriwa was trying to discharge a high office of the Crown and they did not know what GOS was, they were dismissed from office. I make this point: John Kerin never entered into an $8 billion unfunded commitment when he was the member for Werriwa. The idea that you can survive in a high office when you do not know the pension benchmark, when you can stand up at a superannuation conference and enter into a commitment without knowing what you say and then afterwards rely on the government to fix up your errors, quite clearly means this: a person who is able to do that -  - could not be trusted with the economic management of the Commonwealth. If a person who is able to do that were ever in office, there would not be a government picking up their mistakes. They would be entered into as commitments, the pensioners of this country would be entitled to rely on them and the taxpayers would pay the price. I have always said this: the Labor Party is policy weak. It does not do the homework, it does not understand the economic concepts and it cannot be trusted with the mortgages of millions of Australians.</DOC>

 - I have already indicated to the Leader of the Opposition that, in the ordinary workings of government, there are numerous communications necessarily of a confidential kind. The stance that I am taking on this is no different from the stance that has been taken by my predecessors on both sides of parliament. Where I do have an obligation to the Australian people is to tell them of the advice that comes to this government regarding threat assessments in relation to potential terrorist attacks.I would refer the Leader to the Opposition again to his interview with Neil Mitchell which was conducted on 19 March, only a few days ago. In answer to a question from Neil Mitchell, this is what the Leader of the Opposition had to say:I think the risk has been there since September 11.If I may correct the Leader of the Opposition, according to our intelligence agencies the risk has in fact been there since before September 11. He goes on to say:It's a new world. We had that horrific attack and Western nations are obviously part of this shocking campaign.Then, importantly, Neil Mitchell asks a question:But don't you think it's wound up a notch?And this is what the Leader of the Opposition has to say:Well, the threat has been there, to our knowledge, since September 11. In terms of the level of threat, that is something that is best left to our intelligence agencies passing on the information to government and with the alert system if need be passing it on to the Australian people.Let me say that, on that issue, I totally agree with the Leader of the Opposition. We should rely on our intelligence agencies. I can tell the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian people that the position we have taken in relation to the threat levels to this country consequent upon our involvement in the war in Iraq has been entirely consistent with the advice that we have received from all of our agencies. None of the agencies - and this goes to the very kernel of what is important to the Australian people - have moved away from the advice that they gave last year that there was no need to lift the general level of threat as a result of our involvement in Iraq. If we received contrary advice, that advice would be made available immediately to the Australian people. The suggestion implicit in the Leader of the Opposition's question that I have in some way held back vital information from the Australian people is totally wrong.</DOC>

 - I do very much thank the member for Pearce for her question, and I know how much her constituents have welcomed the government's $2.9 billion investment in strengthening and extending our Medicare system. Let me say to the member for Pearce and all other members that the MedicarePlus safety net is the biggest single improvement to our health system since Medicare commenced back in 1983. What it means is that people in the safety net will have access to much higher rebates based on the actual fee and not the scheduled fee. The very heart of Medicare is affordable access to high-quality health care. Thanks to this safety net, 450,000 Australians will benefit every year, but all 20 million Australians will have the peace of mind and the security of knowing that the safety net is there if they need it.I can inform the House that, as of last Friday, nearly 52,000 individuals and families had incurred out-of-pocket, out-of-benefit expenses over $300. Nearly 5,000 individuals and families had incurred out-of-pocket, out-of-hospital benefits over $700. These people are benefiting from the Howard government's MedicarePlus safety net. By contrast, just 1,900 individuals and families were in a position as of last Friday to benefit from Labor's discredited MBS safety net. What is more, of the 52,000 individuals and families who had incurred more than $300 in MBS out-of-pocket expenses, only 15 per cent of those expenses were due to GP costs. The vast majority were due to day procedures, sophisticated diagnostics and specialist visits. These procedures have never been widely bulk-billed.I have been asked about alternative policies. Let every member of this House know, let every one of the 450,000 Australians who will benefit from the safety net know, let all 20 million Australians know: Labor's policy is to repeal the MedicarePlus safety net. That means that 450,000 people a year are going to be left in the lurch because of Labor's commitment to old-fashioned ideology. I call on the Australian Labor Party to accept that out there in the real world not everyone is going to the bulk-billed for all services all the time and to end this threat to the safety net that 450,000 Australians need.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question and I refer him to an article which was published in the Financial Review last Thursday by the chief economist of the OECD, Jean-Phillippe Cotis - I do not know if I said that correctly, I was a victim of a modern education so my French is not as good as it should be. In this article, the chief economist of the OECD said:Australians were once used to observing their ranking decline in GDP per capita. This is no longer so. Indeed, experts in other economies are looking to Australia as a role model. How has Australia managed to achieve higher and sustained economic growth? Why has Australia withstood better than most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development economies the global slowdown ...In this article, the chief economist went on to talk about the importance of the structural policies of economic reform, which have contributed to the flexibility of the Australian economy. He said that those structural reforms have to be done in the context of sound macroeconomic policy. It was sound macroeconomic policy which led this government in 1996 to take the Australian budget out of deficit and to balance it. It was sound macroeconomic policy which led the government to reduce Labor's debt by over $60 billion. It was sound macroeconomic policy to put monetary policy in a medium-term inflation-targeting framework. It was sound policy to reform Australia's taxation system and to introduce a broad based indirect tax and to lower company taxes and capital gains tax. It is the sound policy of increasing the flexibility and openness of the Australian economy which will give us the opportunity to compete and to be up with the top economies of the world in the economic race which is now taking part in our region, Europe and elsewhere. These are the important points of economic management: durability, sustainability, concerted purpose and the determination to do the hard work and to get things right.I also refer the House to another statement that was made on 3LO in Melbourne this morning:The economy is going very well. GDP growth is around 4 per cent a year, inflation is quite low. Employment growth has been reasonably strong and unemployment has fallen ...Do you know who said that on Melbourne radio this morning? Greg Combet, the Secretary of the ACTU. They are the words that no-one on the other side of the House, including the member for Rankin, have been able to utter. Have you heard the member for Werriwa, the member for Hotham or the member for Fraser stand up and say, as Greg Combet did, that GDP growth is at four per cent, inflation is low, employment growth is good and unemployment falling?This is not an accident. This is the point: economic management does not come by accident. It does not come from haphazard thought bubbles which are produced one day and airbrushed away the next day. It comes from determined action and determined and disciplined policy. We are not out of the woods yet. The Australian economy has not passed all of the challenges. If people think that the Australian economy has passed the challenges they might think that we are ready for a return to Labor government - we are not. There is still work to be done: we have to reform Australia's labour market; we have to make sure that we reform the disability support pension; and we have to make sure that we get more people into work. We have to make sure that we take on those structural issues and make them our own and that we set young Australians up for the ageing of the population in a way that will give them a start that people in no other Western developed country will have. These are the challenges of economic management, and they are the challenges which this government is focusing on. The reform of the past has set us up for today and it is the reform of today which will set us up for tomorrow.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition has developed a new reverence for holders of statutory office! He did not have much reverence for the holder of a very high statutory office - namely, the head of ASIC - on 25 September 2001, when he was prepared to use the privilege of parliament to traduce the reputation of an honest citizen. But I shouldn't mention that, should I? - No! - That was in 2001! What an outrageous thing! But when he went in to bat for Nick Whitlam he did not care about the reputation of David Knott - he could not care less. So the last person in this parliament who has a right to give me lectures about treatment of statutory office holders is the Leader of the Opposition.I will say this about our security agencies. Over the last several years, because of the tragic security circumstances that the world has faced, I have worked probably more closely with the leader of the Australian Federal Police, the leader of ASIO, the leader of ASIS and the Director-General of the Office of National Assessments than any of my predecessors. That is no reflection on any of my predecessors; rather, it is a statement of the obvious. It is fair to say that over that period of time the greatest attacks that have come on our agencies have come from the Australian Labor Party, not this side of the parliament.I have stood up for the reputation of the Office of National Assessments. I have stood up for the reputation of ASIO. I have a great regard for the Director-General of ASIO and I have a great regard for the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. - He continues to enjoy my very strong confidence. I do not accept for a moment the categorisation that the Leader of the Opposition has put on my conduct. All of the exchanges that have taken place over the last week have been entirely proper and entirely consistent with the normal exchanges that would take pace in similar circumstances. If the Leader of the Opposition has any more questions or a censure motion, please bring it on.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question. This is an issue of great interest to him and certainly to many of his constituents in the electorate of Wentworth. Israel has now confirmed responsibility for the death of the Hamas founder and so-called spiritual leader of Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, who was killed in Gaza yesterday. As I have consistently said, this government strongly supports Israel's right to defend itself from terrorism, and Hamas is a terrorist organisation. The government listed it as a proscribed organisation for the purposes of asset freezing in December 2001. On 9 December 2003 Hamas's military wing was proscribed under separate criminal legislation, which makes membership of the Hamas military wing here in Australia illegal. Hamas has used suicide bombers to target and murder many innocent Israelis. Sheik Ahmed Yassin supported these actions - he said so on many occasions.Having said all that, let me make it clear that I do regret the use of targeted assassinations. This government does not support targeted assassinations. I am concerned that the killing of such a high-profile Palestinian leader will simply lead to further violence and the loss of innocent life - not that we, of course, would in any way condone that. The perspective of the Australian government is to urge calm and to call on both sides to exercise maximum restraint at this difficult time. Violence, after all, will not settle the Middle East dispute. The long-term interests of both sides rest in the resumption of negotiations under the internationally endorsed road map and building on what was agreed initially in the road map.As far as the honourable member's question on travel advisory is concerned, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to urge all Australians in Israel to exercise extreme caution, and if concerned about their safety they should consider departure. Australians should consider carefully their need to travel to Israel at this time. DFAT further advises that Australians should not travel to the West Bank or to the Gaza Strip. Australians in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip should leave where it is possible and safe to do so. I note that this may be difficult as the Israeli government has, for the moment, sealed off the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</DOC>

 - At no time did the commissioner tender his resignation. -  - Let me make it very clear that not only is that the case but it certainly would not have been an eventuality that I would have supported or wanted. Now that the Leader of the Opposition has returned to the subject of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, I have the opportunity of pointing out to the parliament that over the last 24 hours the mantra of the Leader of the Opposition has been that he is the great defender of the office of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner and he is the great defender of that man against unfair attacks.I wonder what the member for Werriwa had to say a bare 18 or 19 months ago, when a combination of Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray launched a most violent attack on the character and the reputation of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner. To give a few examples, Senator Faulkner issued a press statement at that time which said:Further questions have been raised about the quality of evidence provided to parliament by the head of the Australian Federal Police, Commissioner Mick Keelty.Speaking in the Senate on 26 September 2002, Senator Ray had this to say:If ever I have seen an evasive witness, it was him at the estimates hearings and at the certain maritime incident inquiry. Why doesn't he front up ...This is Senator Ray talking about the man that you have claimed -  - for the last 24 hours that you have been the great defender of. - What this demonstrates is that you do not care about the office -  - The Leader of the Opposition does not care about the reputation and the office of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner; he is perfectly happy to stand by and allow his senior colleagues to traduce his reputation under parliamentary privilege. This is what Senator Ray had to say:Today I read the tirade - he called it `the tirade' - from the commissioner of police, who cannot understand the subtlety of what Senator Faulkner said ...I have to say that subtlety in Senator Faulkner escapes a great number of us on this side of the House and throughout the Australian community. Senator Ray said:... he just completely misinterpreted it for his own purposes. If ever I have seen an evasive witness, it was him at the estimates hearings and at the certain maritime incident inquiry. Why doesn't he front up and give straightforward evidence? Why have all these officials got such selective memories or a lack of intellectual rigour that would force them to probe certain issues that they should be pursuing if they hold responsible jobs? I cannot understand that.The point I simply make is that, for the purposes of this political debate, the Leader of the Opposition parades himself as a defender of the commissioner of the Federal Police yet 18 months ago, when it suited the political purposes of the Australian Labor Party, he was prepared to remain silent while two of his most senior colleagues abused parliamentary privilege and tried to denigrate the reputation of Mick Keelty. There was nothing said by the Australian Labor Party then. What did he have to say by way of rebuke -  -  - On 25 September 2002, during the adjournment debate, this is what Senator Faulkner had to say. To my knowledge it remained unrebuked by any senior member of the Australian Labor Party, by the then Leader of the Opposition, by the member for Werriwa or indeed by anybody else. This is what he had to say, and I invite the House to listen to this very carefully. He said, in part:I intend to keep asking questions until I find out. And, Mr Acting Deputy President, I intend to keep pressing for an independent judicial inquiry into these very serious matters. At no stage do I want to break, nor will I break, the protocols in relation to operational matters involving ASIS or the AFP.And here is the punchline:But those protocols -  - Senator Faulkner went on to say this:But those protocols were not meant as a direct or an indirect licence to kill.That was the language that was used by Senator Faulkner: `a direct or an indirect licence to kill'. I do not recall the member for the Werriwa or the then Leader of the Opposition rushing to the defence of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, demanding that those unfair allegations against the character of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner should be withdrawn. As a consequence of those attacks, the Australian Federal Police Commissioner issued a statement which in part said:Therefore, Senator Faulkner could have clarified his position before embarking any further on his allegations. Instead, he has chosen to sully the reputation of the AFP, and myself as the Commissioner, instead of availing himself of the facts.That came from a senior figure in the Australian Labor Party. Those remarks were left unrebuked by anybody in the Labor Party, and they destroyed any capacity of the Leader of the Opposition to parade himself as a friend and defender of the Australian Federal Police.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for Farrer for her question. Australian troops are playing a vital role in supporting coalition efforts to stabilise and rehabilitate Iraq and are achieving considerable success. Amongst the Australian detachment in Iraq there is, importantly, a security detachment of 85 soldiers who provide security to Australian diplomats and officials assisting with the rehabilitation of Iraq. There is in addition to that a team of 53 who are providing training to a new Iraqi army in order to build up the army and make it effective and viable. Another team is going in next month to train Iraq's fledgling coastal defence force.In addition, but based outside of Iraq, are some logistics support personnel who fly C130 transport aircraft. We have some air traffic controllers at Baghdad International Airport, providing air traffic control there. There are about 50 personnel assisting with coalition headquarters operations, again inside and outside of Iraq. In the Persian Gulf at the moment is HMAS Melbourne,which supports coalition maritime operations in the gulf. This is not a big deployment. Particularly for those actually in Iraq the numbers are fairly small but they do essential work, and I particularly again refer to the 85 soldiers who provide protection to the Australian officials and diplomats who are based there. We will not impose any artificial deadlines on these deployments. Our commitment is to the security and safety of Australians in Iraq and to the Iraqi people, to help them after all those years of dictatorship, as they are at last finding freedom for their own people.The honourable member asked whether there are any alternative views. Important amongst all the views that are expressed on this issue are the views of the Iraqi people. I notice in the Oxford Research International poll which was commissioned by the BBC, and which I was quoting yesterday, only 15 per cent of Iraqis want the coalition forces to leave. That is not surprising. They do not want coalition forces to stay indefinitely, obviously, but they want coalition forces to stay for some time in order to underwrite their security as their police get under way and their own new Iraqi army is formed.I note since the Madrid bombing, because this has become rather a poignant issue since the Madrid bombing, that a number of the 35 countries which have troops deployed in Iraq have said that they will be keeping their troops in Iraq and they will not be doing what the incoming Spanish government says it will do, and that is withdraw. Amongst those who have said they are keeping troops there are Poland, Japan, Italy, South Korea and the Philippines. I know the Secretary General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, has made similar sorts of remarks.Last week I spoke with the Spanish charge d'affaires and I made it clear to him that we are concerned that the newly elected Spanish government may withdraw Spain's troops by midyear. We think this sends the wrong message. It sends a message to the terrorists that they can commit an atrocity in Madrid and persuade Spain to withdraw its troops from doing essential and good work in Iraq. Anyway, we will just have to wait and see what the new Spanish government finally decides to do. But I do note that the incoming Spanish Prime Minister, the Prime Minister elect, has reiterated on a number of occasions his view that he wants the troops out by the middle of the year. I do not want to make much of a point of this, but I notice that the Leader of the Opposition on 2UE this morning said that Labor's intention is to ensure that, once responsibility is discharged - and that is at the time of a handover to a new sovereign government in Iraq - then Australian troops would come back. It is on 30 June that this is going to happen - and, whatever optimism or pessimism there may be in the Australian Labor Party, there will not be an election before 30 June, I suspect, Prime Minister, although I guess we do not really know. But I think we can safely assume that, and therefore -  -  - I can see the Labor Party are really concentrating on the important issues! I am sure your interjections will impress the public that the new standards you are setting in parliament are so high! The serious point here is that the Leader of the Opposition is suggesting that Labor's policy is for all the troops to be withdrawn before 30 June. I would only say this: I would like the Leader of the Opposition to reconsider that position and I would hope that he would find it possible to embrace a bipartisan position on Australian troops in Iraq and to support the government's view that we do not want artificial deadlines associated with these deployments, particularly bearing in mind that quite a number of these troops are protecting our officials there, and obviously we have no intention of withdrawing our officials.</DOC>

 - I have already indicated two things and I will not be adding to them. The first is that he did not offer his resignation, and the second is that, in accordance with longstanding practice of governments of different persuasions and at various levels in Australia, discussions in communications between senior ministers and senior officials are in fact confidential and I have no intention of breaking that confidentiality. The latest bit of field evidence that that is a bipartisan view is contained in a report in the West Australian of 12 March 2004 referring to a well-known argument between the Western Australian Police Commissioner and the police minister, Michelle Roberts. When there was a furious conversation between the Premier of Western Australia and the commissioner:Dr Gallop yesterday refused to deny the telephone row took place. A spokesman for the Premier said he regarded any conversation with the Police Commissioner as confidential.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question and say in reply to him that the government's workplace relations policies have been one of the major reasons why, under this government, some 1.2 million extra jobs have been created and why wages for full-time employees have risen by more than $90. In fact it is the coalition's policies that have given Australian families the security to plan for their future.He asked me about alternatives, and I noticed in the Australian Financial Review this morning a headline which said `Business Council slates Labor's IR plan'. The Business Council, of course, is an organisation that represents 100 of the largest companies in Australia - companies which employ almost one million Australian people. The chair of the Business Council, Mr Hugh Morgan, is reported as saying -  -  - Opposition members scoff at companies which provide employment for almost one million Australians. Mr Morgan said:I think AWAs have made a significant contribution to the industrial scene. It is a widespread freedom in making arrangements between employers and employees, much more than we have seen in the past, and that has resulted in a huge increase in job satisfaction and productivity growth in Australia.Mr Morgan also said that there is `almost zero' support amongst businesses for removing the secondary boycott provisions from the Trade Practices Act - something proposed by the Australian Labor Party. The Business Council is not alone in its rejection of Labor's policies. Not only big business but medium and small business as well have rejected and are rejecting Labor's workplace relations policy. Steve Knott from the Australian Mines and Metals Association - the association which represents the major mining companies in Australia, those companies which add substantially to the wealth of this country and employ thousands of Australians - said, `The delegates at the forum have let the Labor Party know that they are seriously 'not happy Jan'.' They are seriously not happy with the Labor Party's proposals. Indeed, Mr Knott said a couple of weeks ago that the Labor Party's workplace relations policy would be `a disastrous U-turn for Australia'. The Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that businesses are seriously concerned about Labor's plan. They said: `Labor's plan will rob Western Australian businesses of a competitive edge. It comes down to issues like jobs growth and sustainability of business and productivity.' So that is yet another business group in Australia rejecting Labor's plan. The CEO of Australian Business Ltd said about Labor's plan to reregulate the workplace:Implementation of such changes would represent a major backwards step for business and Australia.Yet this is what the Labor Party is proposing. And even small business is rejecting the Labor Party. The Combined Small Business Associations of Western Australia felt so outraged by the Labor Party's workplace relations plans that they wrote to the Leader of the Opposition, saying:Small business should be afraid - very afraid.Indeed they should. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's analysis of Labor's industrial relations platform is important reading for all Australians, saying that it is more regulatory than when Labor was last in government. They also say:... further regulation and heightened trade union activity would have significant implications for jobs and employment.Employment, of course, is something which was deleted from the Leader of the Opposition's major speech to the Australian Labor Party's conference a few weeks ago. The Leader of the Opposition simply does not understand how damaging these workplace relations plans are for Australia, for Australians and for jobs in this country. They are a threat to the Australian economy and they are a threat to the prosperity of this country. A more experienced Labor leader would understand the impact of these disastrous policies. A more experienced Leader of the Opposition would understand the impact of these policies. If ever they were implemented, they would be a train wreck for the Australian economy. No wonder business - small business, medium business and large business - is saying that these policies are bad for business. They are bad for jobs, they are bad for workers and they are bad for Australia.</DOC>

 - First of all, in answer to the honourable member's question, I am waiting for Senator Faulkner's apology to the commissioner. We look forward to hearing that. I hope the Leader of the Opposition will remain calm throughout question time today - Hawker Britton have no doubt been on the phone. I hope that the member for Griffith will take that question up with Senator Faulkner in relation to his remarks about the Police Commissioner.Secondly, I have certainly had discussions with the Federal Police Commissioner, and he clearly understands the broad point I was making about al-Qaeda. I make a further comment: if you read the whole of the interview, you will see it is perfectly clear the point I am making. The point I am making is that al-Qaeda, as an organisation, is out there running a line about Iraq, as it did once about East Timor and still does from time to time - and it runs lines about other issues such as the Palestinian-Israeli dispute - but, at heart, what al-Qaeda is basically about is the destruction of moderate Islamic governments and the replacement of those governments with Taliban style extremist regimes. That is what they are ultimately about. That is the point I was making, and the commissioner perfectly well understood that. If you read the full transcript, that is perfectly clear.I think it is preposterous for the opposition on the one hand to ignore completely what Senator Faulkner has said about the Police Commissioner for their own convenience and on the other hand to try to interpret what I have said as though I am suggesting that Mr Keelty is part of al-Qaeda or is supporting al-Qaeda. Mr Keelty knows only too well, as do I - as does anyone with any commonsense - that that is a simply preposterous and outrageous interpretation of what I said. I can only reinforce the view that Mr Keelty and I have done a tremendous amount of good work together over the last few years. Oh, no, you have never asked any questions about the Solomon Islands and the work we have been doing together there! Oh, no, you never bother to ask a question about the work we have been doing in Indonesia to counter terrorism, because it does not suit your narrow party political game playing! - Oh, no, it does not suit their narrow party political game playing. - And that is what all this is about. On the one hand, the opposition says that the government has somehow politically interfered with the Commissioner of Police and, on the other hand, it is determined to play politics with this issue for as long as it can. The member for Griffith's question simply reinforces that point.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Indi for her question. Plainly, as indeed the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations only a few moments ago talking on this subject was able to indicate, our workplace relations reforms have enormously benefited Australia. There can be no dispute about that. You have seen the creation within this framework by Australian business of more than 1.3 million new jobs since 1996 and real wages have increased massively - something in the order of 16 per cent. Industrial disputes are at their lowest level since records were kept.These reforms have particularly benefited regional Australia. I note that unemployment in the electorate of Indi is as low as 4.1 per cent - clear evidence of the value of workplace reform. We face in regional Australia a much higher proportion of the work force being self-employed or contractors and many more people working on a casual basis, particularly in the farm sector and in tourism. The reality is that regional employers and workers have enthusiastically embraced the flexibility we have added to the system as it has created more jobs. Just under half the new jobs created in Australia are outside the major cities, despite the population disparity between urban and regional Australia.I am asked about alternative policies. The fact is that the policies put forward by the opposition would be, quite simply, a disaster for regional businesses and the people who work for them. They would be seriously detrimental. They are in fact summed up, and I think this is very interesting, by the member for Rankin - I ask that all members of the House listen to this - in his announcement, `The Labor Party and unions are in partnership once again.' They are in partnership once more - that is what their spokesman for industrial relations says - and indeed they are. - They are in partnership to increase the membership and influence of the trade union movement - and this is very important - to funnel government contracts to union friendly employers. The Labor Party is busily designing elaborate mechanisms to force departments and agencies, should they ever win power, to comply. Of particular interest is this quote from the opposition's platform: `They will ensure that there is a willingness by government departments to exercise this power.' What on earth could that mean: `A willingness by government departments to exercise this power'? The spokesman is back again. What that of course means is that you would have to re-educate public servants against this quaint idea that they procure things on the basis of value for taxpayers. That is what it means. You would no longer look to the interests of the taxpayers for best value; you would look to see whether the provider was `union friendly'. That is what this is about. So much for the Leader of the Opposition's promises about an independent Public Service. That is the first thing that you know you can scrub out.The second point is that we need to ask why Labor have formed such an extraordinary partnership with the unions. This goes further than anything else they have done in the past. - The reason is that union membership is down to just 17 per cent. - They are irrelevant to many Australian workers, and you want to find a way to make them relevant again. - This partnership takes the principle of the Centenary House lease and extends its benefits to the unions but on a much bigger scale. That is what it does. - He does not like it. - Let us just consider this for a moment: the Centenary House lease misdirects a mere $36 million of government money to prop up Labor's finances -  - but this new partnership would misdirect billions of dollars of government purchasing to prop up union membership.

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question and his ongoing interest and support for small business in his electorate. Last night the Australian Labor Party continued their crazy policy of opposing amendments and improvements to the unfair dismissal system. Last night the Labor Party proved in action just how damaging they are to the Australian economy, because in effect what the Labor Party did last night was to vote against jobs. Yesterday in the Senate the ALP voted against the government's attempts to improve the unfair dismissal system. These improvements would have meant we had one unfair dismissal system for some seven million Australian workers, rather than the complex, complicated and confusing six systems that are in place. It is just stupid policy on the part of the Labor Party to oppose these sorts of measures.There have now been 40 separate occasions when the Australian Labor Party has voted against attempts to improve the unfair dismissal system in Australia. On 40 occasions, the Australian Labor Party has shown that it has more interest in backing the union bosses who fund it than supporting the hardworking 1.1 million Australian small businesses and the millions of Australians which they employ. There is a certain symmetry here, because on 40 occasions the Australian Labor Party has voted against improvements to the unfair dismissal system and it just so happens that $40 million has been donated by those unions to the Australian Labor Party. On 40 occasions the Australian Labor Party has voted against improvements to the unfair dismissal system in Australia, which would have created jobs in this country, and it just so happens that those unions that oppose it have given $40 million in the last seven years to the Australian Labor Party. And that is on top of the $36 million rip-off from the Centenary House deal. So we know where Labor's interests lie. They do not lie with the unemployed people in Australia. They do not lie with people seeking to get a job. They do not lie with the small businesses of Australia that could employ more Australians. In fact, independent research by the Melbourne Institute has estimated that the cost of compliance with unfair dismissal laws adds a further bill of $1.3 billion to the cost of running small and medium sized businesses in Australia. So these unfair dismissal laws add $1.3 billion in additional costs to running small and medium sized businesses in Australia. In addition to that, the research has shown that the unfair dismissal laws have cost some 77,000 jobs in Australia. In other words, another 77,000 Australians could be in employment if it were not for the obstruction and the mindless opposition of the Australian Labor Party. The Leader of the Opposition likes to talk about new policies, yet here we have him once again following the instructions of the old dinosaurs of the union movement. Last night was yet again another demonstration that the Leader of the Opposition is simply opposing for opposition's sake. If we had a more experienced and courageous Leader of the Opposition, he would have defied the big union bosses in this regard and stood up for Australian businesses and the people they employ. </DOC>

 - The honourable member has asked a number of questions over the last few weeks about the presence of nitrofuran in honey imported into Australia, and I have provided a number of answers to him in that regard. He also has a question on notice in relation to these matters. The reality is that these products are not permitted for use in Australia. There are a number of allegations that some imports into this country may include antibiotics like nitrofuran. As a result of that, Food Standards Australia New Zealand have requested that testing be undertaken. Through Biosecurity Australia, we are endeavouring to establish a testing regime in this country. There are currently no tests available in Australia for this residue, and work is being undertaken with laboratories to develop such a test. Once a laboratory is accredited, that testing program will commence.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Dickson for his question and his knowledge. He is a great representative for Dickson, and he is a very fine man as well. I can confirm that the Liberal-National coalition will not be introducing new taxes or increasing taxes on Australia's 1.1 million small businesses. That is because we believe in lower taxes. That is why we abolished wholesale sales tax. That is why we abolished provisional tax. That is why we effectively halved capital gains tax. That is why we reduced income tax. That is why we put in place the small business rollover relief on capital gains tax. That is why we have abolished the indexation of fuel excise. That is why we have such a low collection of tax by the federal government compared to GDP - because the coalition believes in less tax. The Labor Party believes in more tax.I have been asked for alternative views on this. The most obvious alternative view has come from the member for Rankin. I am disappointed that he is not in the place. The member for Rankin has constantly backed up my observations that the Labor Party intends to introduce a national payroll tax to pay for its employee entitlement prospects. The Prime Minister has been exhorting us all to look not at what Labor says but at what it does. Yesterday in the House the member for Rankin said that it is a myth:... that Labor will introduce a national portable long service leave scheme....	...	...The reality is that neither the ACT government nor federal Labor supports a national portable long service leave scheme.Yesterday in this place the member for Rankin said there is no policy proposal for a national portable long service leave scheme. That seems at odds. Firstly, it was at odds because we know the position of the ACT government. I quote from the Canberra Times, which says that Chief Minister John Stanhope and ACT industrial relations minister Katy Gallagher are:... working with employers and employees to draw up a separate government plan to provide for the portability of long service leave.Yesterday in this place the member for Rankin said that the ACT government has no plans for the portability of long service leave - and the Chief Minister of the ACT has said he is drawing up his own bill. I remind the member for Rankin -  - and I am happy to remind the member for Fraser as well - that yesterday in the House he said:The reality is that neither the ACT government nor federal Labor supports a national portable long service leave scheme.I went to the Labor Party web site. Item 76 of the national policy platform of the Labor Party, passed in January, says:Labor will facilitate schemes that provide portability of leave entitlements between employers where those entitlements would otherwise be lost to the employee.So the Labor Party's own national policy platform, passed this year, says that the Labor Party is going to introduce portability of long service leave. - I am happy to table it. Yesterday in this place, the member for Rankin said:The reality is that neither the ACT government nor federal Labor supports a national portable long service leave scheme.It gets better. The member for Rankin might plead memory loss on this - he might have short-term memory problems - but it gets better. An amendment was moved to the Labor Party national platform. That amendment says:Labor acknowledges that less people are becoming eligible for long service leave and will examine ways in which long service leave can be returned to being a mainstream entitlement which better reflects the contemporary labour market.I thought about that - an amendment, specifically insisting that the Labor Party have a policy to introduce portability of long service leave - and I asked myself: who would move that amendment? Mover: Craig Emerson. Seconder: Jeffrey Lawrence. Amendment 145A, chapter 3. The member for Rankin came into this place yesterday and said that the Labor Party have no plans to introduce portability of long service leave, yet the ACT Chief Minister is drawing up legislation, the national platform of the Labor Party says it is Labor Party policy and the member for Rankin moves the amendment himself on the floor of the Labor Party national convention. It just goes to prove: do not listen to what the Labor Party say; look at what they do.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macarthur for his question. I want to say that everyone knows where the member for Macarthur stands on drugs. Everyone knows where the Howard government stands on drugs. The Howard government's policy is clear: it is to be tough on drugs. Since 1997 the Howard government has spent more than $1 billion to cut the use of illicit drugs, to cut the demand for illicit drugs and to help the victims of this evil trade which destroys young lives, which breaks up families and which can poison entire communities.I am pleased to say to the member for Macarthur that there are some encouraging signs that the Howard government's policies are working. The most recent national survey on drugs showed a 23 per cent reduction in people using illicit drugs since 1998. The proportion using heroin dropped from 0.8 per cent to 0.2 per cent. Most of all, there has been a big drop in the number of drug related deaths, from over 1,100 in 1999 to under 400 in 2002. Not only that, but families are now talking about the dangers of illicit drugs. As part of the 2001 Illicit Drugs Campaign, some 78 per cent of parents spoke to their children on this topic. In 2002 there were some 30,000 treatment courses, compared to just 19,000 treatment courses in the previous year.I have been asked about alternative policies. Back in the days when he was a frontbencher, the Leader of the Opposition was asked about heroin trials. He said:Perhaps the rest of the nation can learn something from a limited trial in the ACT.He went on to say:I would think it's just common sense to have heroin addicts in a controlled environment where there's proper supervision ...He was asked again about drug trials and injecting rooms when he became Leader of the Opposition. He said last month:Labor has said consistently we'll support trials ...He has never seen a drug experiment that he has not supported. He wants to read books to kids when they are five and he wants to give them access to drug injecting rooms when they are 15. -  - He is not the only one on the other side of this parliament who is soft on drug abuse. -  - Mr Speaker, I am happy to withdraw the statement that you found offensive. I simply make the point that the Leader of the Opposition is on the record supporting heroin trials and supporting injecting rooms. Labor have said consistently: `We'll support trials.' They are the words of the Leader of the Opposition himself. No wonder he did not find them offensive; obviously he is proud of them. But he is not the only one on the other side of this parliament who is consistently soft on drug abuse. The member for Wills supported the ACT heroin trial. The member for Watson supports injecting rooms. The member for heroin -  -  - The member for Sydney. Sorry, that was a Freudian slip! She recognises herself. The member for Sydney supports heroin injecting rooms. Then of course there is the member for Grayndler - where is he at the moment? - who said:... drug dependence is a medical not a criminal problem ...He not only supports the injecting room, which has been such a magnet for drug pushers; he does not even think that drugs should be illegal. Then there is the ALP's 2001 policy statement, under the member for Brand, which said:Labor will combat drug abuse ...That strong statement is completely absent from the current policy endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to say precisely where he stands. Where does he stand on illicit drugs? Will he oppose drug trials? Will he oppose the injecting rooms? And will he do his bit to end that climate of despair and defeatism which says that our role is to help people manage their addictions, not to do the right thing and help people to get off illegal drugs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Perth for his question, but it is quite evident that he is acting in this role and has no understanding or appreciation of the history of this matter. In fact, when the Howard government came to office in 1996, they found aged care in a state of neglect. Labor ought to be ashamed of its record in aged care. Not only was there a 10,000 bed deficit that we inherited, which we have managed to overcome by allocating 55,600 new aged care places across Australia, but the standards in aged care facilities across Australia were, on average, poor.This government introduced an accreditation system which was the first national legislated quality assurance program that had ever been introduced into aged care facilities in Australia. As a result of that accreditation system, instances of poor care come to light. Under Labor, these instances of poor care were swept under the carpet and nobody ever took any notice of them or took any action. Under this government's accreditation system, instances of poor care come to light. Under the accreditation system, all providers who receive federal government subsidies must be accredited. They are put through a stringent review process and must account for 44 outcomes in four separate categories. Accreditation is followed up by reviews, audits and spot checks. Whilst instances of poor care are never acceptable, under our accreditation system action is taken when these matters are detected.It is a shame that the member for Perth did not read all of the article from which he clearly gleaned his question. There were seven residents of Riverside who were, in fact, moved to a facility called Ripplebrook. The former Ripplebrook home is now called Sandhurst and is run by Chevron Corporation Pty Ltd. As an article in the Herald Sun reported today, Ms Harver, who is the operations manager, has said that the home, which she understood housed seven residents from Riverside, was now fully compliant with all 44 federal outcomes. This is evidence that our system is working. Labor has no alternative policy - not one idea - for aged care. This government cares for older Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parkes for his question. I acknowledge his recognition of the importance of this agreement to many of his constituents, not just those in the agriculture sector but also those in the manufacturing and service sectors in his electorate, and the opportunities that will be provided to them to access a market of almost 300 million people running an economy that is the biggest economy in the world and the most dynamic economy in the world. Of course, he recognises - and so do his constituents - the importance of seeing the free trade agreement with the United States enter into force by the beginning of next year.Australia's farmers also want to get access to that market. Nobody would want to miss out on an opportunity to access a market that wealthy and of that size. The farmers in the electorate of Parkes and, indeed, farmers across Australia know this is a good deal. They also know very well that this deal would not be in place and would not have been done under a Labor government or under the leadership of the current Leader of the Opposition, whose anti-American attitude has been well recorded publicly in Australia. They simply know that the deal would not have been done under a Labor government.A number of commentators have referred to the importance of this agreement to their sectors. I quote Mr John Webster from Horticulture Australia, who said that, before the negotiations began, `only two per cent of fresh Australian horticultural exports came into the US tariff free; now 100 per cent of all major current fresh exports will have zero tariffs'. Allan Burgess, the Chairman of the Australian Dairy Industry Council, said that `for dairies, successful ratification of the Australia-United States free trade agreement will increase access to a huge and expanding market'. Even the American Farm Bureau, the peak farm body in the United States, has indicated that the FTA would benefit Australian farmers in excess of $500 million a year every year after it enters into force. That is an extra $500 million of Australian produce going into the United States market every year.But again on radio today the Leader of the Opposition was not prepared to support an agreement that is overwhelmingly in the national interest. He was not prepared to support an agreement that is going to deliver some significant benefits to Australia's farmers. The Labor Party should support this FTA on its merits. The Leader of the Opposition should not let his anti-American attitude cloud his view of what is in the national interest. He should not let that cloud his view. The Leader of the Opposition should not be bought off by the unions on this issue. We heard in earlier comments about the very close relationship, financially and otherwise, between the Australian Labor Party and the union movement and how that is delivered upon in this place: by the Australian Labor Party knocking back legislation in the Senate overnight again. I say again: the Leader of the Opposition should not be bought off by the unions on this. Sharan Burrow, Doug Cameron and anti-American Labor MPs should not stand in the way of what is in Australia's national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Perth for his question and note that he is able to read from the web site of the accreditation agency, which sets out in the most transparent and accountable manner the detail of action taken by the accreditation agency when it detects instances of poor care. The accreditation system that this government put in place ensures that the delivery of care to all residents in aged care facilities is at an appropriate standard. If a home does not comply with those standards then action is taken. That can include the appointment of a nurse administrator or management or, indeed, sanctions.The results of the reviews, audits and visits are put on a web site so that there is also a deterrent effect on other homes. In the case of Vincenpaul Hostel in the electorate of Chisholm, the department imposed sanctions on the approved provider. They required the home to appoint a nurse adviser. It made the home ineligible to receive Australian government funding for new residents for six months. The department and the independent accreditation agency continue to monitor this home. I can assure all residents of aged care facilities subsidised by the federal government that their care and the continuity of their care remains a top priority for this government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. At the 2001 election, the Prime Minister undertook to ensure that we would hold an inquiry into the financial status of aged care facilities across Australia. We commissioned Professor Warren Hogan to undertake a review into the pricing arrangements. His terms of reference were extraordinarily wide and he carried out a thorough analysis, with fulsome analyses of the industry. There were some 1,200 submissions to the Hogan review and some 917 submissions on the financial status of the industry. - These financial submissions have been analysed by KPMG and I understand have informed Professor Hogan's recommendations in relation to the current and future viability of the aged care industry. The government received a copy of Professor Hogan's recommendations a couple of weeks ago - I think it was three weeks ago. The matter is currently before cabinet. As I put out in a press release on Thursday of the previous sitting week, the Hogan review is being considered in the context of the 2004 budget.The member raises a question about the viability of a home in her electorate. The government has increased funding for aged care from $3 billion since it came to government in 1996 to $6 billion today - $4.5 billion of that sum is directed to recurrent subsidies for residential care, with $2.2 billion specifically for dementia care. We have also allocated capital grants to homes that would not otherwise be able to raise capital. In fact, in the 2003 aged care allocation round, $36 million was allocated to smaller aged care facilities across Australia to meet capital needs. The figure of $36 million might ring a bell in some circles - $36 million happens to be the amount that the Labor Party is siphoning off from Centenary House. - If $36 million could be allocated to aged care facilities across Australia, that would mean 3,000 more aged care places. It would mean 3,000 community aged care packages. That $36 million would assist in the capital requirements of a number of aged care facilities. The Hogan review is being considered. The government will respond shortly, but I can assure all Australians that aged care is a priority of this government.</DOC>

 - Not only is a week a long time in politics, Mr Speaker, but members opposite are desperately trying to forget their embarrassment and shame about the rent rort rip-off. I am very pleased that the member for Fairfax has again reminded the House of the Centenary House rip-off, because every day the rent rort goes on the fleece meter ticks on: $6,721 every day as a free gift from the Australian taxpayer to the Australian Labor Party courtesy of the sweetheart deal negotiated by the former Labor government. We learnt today that Centenary House is going to be the national campaign headquarters for the coming election campaign. They might as well have a banner hung up on the top of the building saying, `In the 33 days of this campaign we are going to get $222,000 as a free gift from the taxpayer courtesy of this rip-off, on top of the $750,000 that the Leader of the Opposition has already trousered from the rip-off since 2 December last year.' The heart of the rent rort rip-off is the ratchet clause in the deal which says that rent goes up by nine per cent or market rates, whichever is the greatest.I have had the chance to examine 13 Commonwealth leases for property in Barton and not one of them has this kind of ratchet clause except the Centenary House deal. We have 10 Brisbane Avenue, Barton. It is a lease for five years at $250 a square metre, and the rent will be reviewed to market every two years. At 40 Blackall Street, Barton, there is a lease for three years at $320 a square metre and the rent will be reviewed to market every two years. At 6 Brisbane Avenue, Barton, there is a six-year lease at $325 a metre with a review to market every two years. At 2 Brisbane Avenue, Barton, it is a six-year lease at $325 a metre, reviewed to market every two years. At 42 Macquarie Street, Barton, it is a five-year lease for $337 a metre, reviewed to market every two years. And then, standing out spectacularly like the Rock of Gibraltar, we have the Centenary House lease, for 15 years at $368 a metre initial rent, reviewed annually to market or nine per cent, whichever is the highest. It is the longest lease, the highest rent and the biggest escalator of all. We heard today how it is Labor policy to funnel contracts to union-friendly employers. It is Labor practice to funnel the best government contract of all time to the union-owned party. -  - Someone said they are not capitalists, but I tell you what, Mr Speaker, these are the greatest capitalists of all time. Sure, they believe in the market - provided it is rigged in the Labor Party's favour. I table the document about leases from which I was reading.We had the Leader of Opposition himself make a speech last week about ethical standards in politics. It got no coverage, and why should it get any coverage? No-one will take this Leader of the Opposition seriously on ethics while he is the beneficiary of the Centenary House rent rort. This is what he had to say last week:During a time of social change and uncertainty, governments need to do more than frame laws - he knows a fair bit about framing - and make decisions. They need to get the public involved in the many social issues we share in common. How do we answer the new challenges of citizenship and identity?Then he said:These issues can only be sorted out satisfactorily by an exchange of views between Australians themselves.He said `every household and library connected to the Internet' should be asked to `join the debate on-line'. He wants an online debate about controversial issues. Here is a challenge to the Leader of the Opposition. Let us have a nationwide online debate - a nationwide online poll - on this question: do people think the Labor Party should end the Centenary House rip-off? Let us have an online poll: should the Labor Party end the rent rort? I challenge the Leader of the Opposition: have the poll, heed the results and end the rent rort now.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for asking me a question on a very important issue. Let me say on behalf of the government that Australian forces will remain in Iraq for as long as is necessary to complete their task of helping the Iraqi people build a better and brighter future. Let me say that, whatever views people may have held on our military participation in Iraq, what we now have are ongoing responsibilities in that country. I intend, as Prime Minister, to see that those responsibilities are discharged.Our forces are engaged in very valuable and practical work - for example, the training of the new Iraqi army and the new Iraqi police force and also making Baghdad International Airport operational. It is therefore unwise of anybody to set arbitrary deadlines for the withdrawal of our forces. I regret very much that the Leader of the Opposition has said that if he were to become Prime Minister of Australia he would seek to have Australian forces home by Christmas. He in fact said in an interview on Sydney radio yesterday that the Labor Party's view was that the forces should leave Iraq at the time their responsibilities ended and that would be at the time of the handover, now projected to be the middle of the year, to a new sovereign authority in Iraq. I do not know on what basis the Leader of the Opposition is saying that the responsibility of our forces would be completed in time for them to be brought home by Christmas.I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that our responsibilities do not end at the time of the legal handover to the Iraqi people. Nobody at the moment has any way of knowing precisely when those responsibilities will end. It is therefore unwise of the Leader of the Opposition to be setting an arbitrary deadline. It sends the wrong signal. It sends the wrong signal to the people of Iraq. It sends the wrong signal to terrorist groups in Iraq. It sends the wrong signal to our coalition allies in Iraq, especially the United States. Once again, whatever people may think of the American alliance, it is important at this present stage in world events and world history that we work as closely as possible in partnership with the United States. I find no embarrassment as Prime Minister of this country in stating that reality and placing a great deal of priority and a great deal of emphasis on it. At this time, there must be maximum unity amongst those with military forces in Iraq.But the opposition leader's comments sit very strangely at odds with those of the man he is now talking to, the shadow foreign minister. Only last November the member for Griffith urged the government - so far from withdrawing our forces - to strengthen our forces in Iraq. That is what the member for Griffith was doing last November. His view on the Insiders program on 16 November of last year was that, although he disagreed with the government, he wanted Australia to go the distance and to fully discharge its responsibilities. This is what the member for Griffith had to say on 16 November:... all people of good will - whether they are from this country or from Europe or elsewhere - now have got a responsibility to put their shoulder to the wheel to try and build a new Iraq. The alternative, frankly, would be disastrous.The member for Griffith was right then, and he is right now. For people in positions of responsibility to be setting arbitrary deadlines for withdrawal is not helpful, and I hope that the Leader of the Opposition will think again. I ask the Leader of the Opposition - in the interests of the people of Iraq, in the interests of the reputation of Australia around the world, in the interests of maintaining our cooperation with our allies in Iraq - to think again, to withdraw this commitment to some kind of arbitrary deadline for withdrawal and to reassess his assessment that the time to withdraw the Australian forces is when authority is handed over to the new body in Iraq, because that is projected to be 30 June. What I understand the Leader of the Opposition to be saying is that if he were now Prime Minister he would be wanting to pull the forces out on 30 June. That would be way ahead of the discharge of our responsibility. If the criterion is that we stay there to do the job, if we keep our shoulder to the wheel, then you do not talk about withdrawing forces by 30 June; you certainly do not talk about withdrawing them by Christmas - in other words, you act responsibly, you reassess your position. In a spirit of bipartisanship, I invite the Leader of the Opposition to do so.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. I appreciate the interest he has in the Australian personnel in Baghdad, because it is not an easy situation for them being there in the heart of the Sunni triangle, where the bulk of the violence that occurs in Iraq these days is happening. The Australian representative office contains a number of diplomats and officials who are trying to advance Australia's interests in Iraq, and they are doing a very good job. They are vital to facilitating Australia's humanitarian reconstruction assistance to Iraq. They are essential advocates of Australia's commercial, political and security interests and they have developed an invaluable network of contacts amongst Iraqi leaders, including the Iraqi governing council, obviously the Coalition Provisional Authority and many of the other leaders and opinion makers. They have ensured that these people understand Australia's perspective and its views, and Australia is able through our office to provide advice. Also importantly, the Australian representative office - in effect the Australian embassy in Baghdad - can provide consular assistance to Australians, which is, I think honourable members would understand, absolutely essential.I have seen the Australian representative office and the Australian Defence Force in operation, and I can commend them on their courage and their professionalism. The Australian representative office staff could not do their job without the support of the Australian Defence Force - that is, without the Australian Defence Force component providing high-level security. I remind the House that the travel advisory that my department has still advises against travel to Iraq, in recognition of security risks. It is unlikely that the risks will evaporate at the time of the handover to the interim Iraqi government.The withdrawal of the Australian Defence Force guarding the Australian representative office would leave our diplomats dangerously exposed. It is worth remembering that the terrorists in Iraq have been shifting their focus to soft targets. I am very concerned, if I may say so, that the Leader of the Opposition appears to have changed his position on this issue of the presence of Australian defence personnel in Iraq, particularly since the Spanish election. I think in this one respect he should take note of what the member for Griffith has said. At the end of last year, after he had been in Baghdad, he said:The protective security, as it relates to the well-being of several hundred Australians still in countries, is of paramount importance ...I have taken the opportunity today of writing to the Leader of the Opposition offering to brief him on the role of the Australian Defence Force in Iraq and on developments in Iraq. I note that on the Neil Mitchell show on 3 December when the Leader of the Opposition was asked his views on the withdrawal of troops he said:Well I have got to get briefings from Foreign Affairs and from the Defence department about the detail. I can't fly in with a top of the head assessment, I have got to base my judgements on fact ... I have obviously got to get those sort of briefings before I can make any sort of considered judgement about what needs to be done.The Leader of the Opposition has not sought the briefings from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Nor, as I understand it, has he sought those briefings from the Department of Defence, although he has nevertheless come out and made the judgments, having said in December he would not make the judgments without those briefings. I make the point that the government is happy to provide him with a briefing. I hope after he has had that briefing that he might give a little more careful consideration to this issue and maybe revise the position that he has taken this week.</DOC>

 - I am very happy to say it should not be years, but I am also very happy to point out to the member for Griffith that what he said in November of last year was commonsense, and I commend him for it. He had a clear-sighted understanding of the fact that it would be wrong to set an arbitrary deadline. What I have expressed concern about, and it is an important issue, is the clear setting by the Leader of the Opposition of an arbitrary deadline. I can understand, and I respect - and I mean this - the fact that the Labor Party holds a different view from what we do on our participation in Iraq. But, as the member for Griffith so effectively pointed out in November of last year, although he disagreed with us he accepted that as we were there we had responsibilities. We had to put our shoulders to the wheel. We had to work with the people of Iraq to build a better future. You do not do that by saying, `I'll have them home by Christmas if I am the Prime Minister.' The Leader of the Opposition cannot deny the fact that on the Mike Carlton program yesterday he said:Well at the point of sovereign hand over to a new Iraq Government. ... there is a time table ...He said that that might be:pushed back a while, but our intention is to ensure that once the responsibility is discharged - I agree with `once the responsibility has been discharged' - and that is at the time of the hand over to the new sovereign Government in Iraq ...That is 30 June. So what the Leader of the Opposition is saying is that our responsibilities, in his view, will be discharged by 30 June. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition that that is manifestly wrong. You can be the most passionate opponent in the world of our involvement in Iraq and still acknowledge that we will be required to be in Iraq beyond 30 June. That is really the point that we are making to the Leader of the Opposition. Okay, oppose what we did in Iraq, but if you are serious about the rebuilding process do not set an arbitrary deadline for withdrawal. The Leader of the Opposition has done that, and nothing he says now, and nothing the member for Griffith says now, can alter the fact that he has locked a Labor government, if it wins -  - into bringing the troops home by December. - Not only is that unhelpful to the people of Iraq but it does send a very bad signal to the terrorists in Iraq and it sends a very bad signal to our allies. We may differ and quarrel about the extent of our relationship with the United States, but this moment in our history is not a time to be walking away from an alliance, a very important coalition association, with the United States. It is not the time to be talking about troop withdrawals. If we want to further build the confidence of the people of Iraq, we will go the distance - we will keep our shoulders to the wheel - because, once again, to use the words of the member for Griffith:The alternative ... would be disastrous.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. I can tell him that at the meeting of the ministerial council for financial relations, which is being held on Friday, the states and the territories - that is, the six states and the two territories - will between them be sharing in the distribution of the total revenue raised by the GST which in 2004-05 will amount to some $34 billion. The Labor Party of course opposed the introduction of the new taxation system and did nothing to actually help with its implementation. On Friday we will be having an unseemly squabble between eight Labor states and territories as to who can get more of it.The distribution of the GST revenue, 100 per cent of which goes to the states, is determined in accordance with the Commonwealth-state financial arrangements agreement which was signed back in 1999 to introduce the new system. The agreement was signed personally by Premier Bob Carr. The Prime Minister and I were there - we negotiated it - and he will recall, as I do, Premier Carr making a beeline for this agreement -  - pulling out his fountain pen, itching to get his signature onto this agreement. Clause 7 of the agreement provides that GST revenue will be distributed in accordance with the principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation, which is a long way of saying that it will be distributed between the states on a fair basis, equalised between them. The horizontal fiscal equalisation process is actually administered by the Commonwealth Grants Commission, and the Commonwealth Grants Commission has been in place since 1933. So this is not a distribution which is done by the Commonwealth government; it is a distribution which is done by an independent arbiter between the Commonwealth and the states, according to the principles that are laid down.The New South Wales government has been advertising against the Commonwealth in relation to this, on the ground that the New South Wales government allegedly somehow missed out in this process. I want to point out to the House that it has not always been thus. The New South Wales government was perfectly prepared to accept the decision of the Commonwealth Grants Commission in 1999, when the same process led to a bonus for New South Wales. How do we know? Because, fortunately for us, Premier Carr has published his diaries. There is a wonderful diary entry for 19 April 1999, when New South Wales unexpectedly got a $166 million windfall. In his diary Mr Carr wrote:To my intense relief [Howard] says he won't - cannot - overturn a recommendation of the Grants Commission unless the States are unanimous.Listen to this:Strong. Fair. I won't hear ill of this man.This gives me a victory to talk about to Sydney media and I praise the prime minister. I've learned that the more unaligned electorate loves this kind of non-partisanship.Under the agreement, which is signed with the principle of the Grants Commission, with the principle of the horizontal fiscal equalisation, no state is worse off. They have a guaranteed minimum, and on current estimates under the GST New South Wales will be receiving as its guaranteed minimum $9,674 million in 2004-05; Victoria will be receiving $7,004 million; Queensland $6,603 million; and Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania accordingly. There is no state that will receive less revenue than under the old system but there are now seven states and territories that are receiving a bonus. The Northern Territory receives a bonus of $87 million, the ACT a bonus of $30 million, Tasmania a bonus of $54 million, Victoria a bonus of $73 million, South Australia a bonus of $64 million, Western Australia a bonus of $146 million and Queensland a bonus of $495 million in 2004-05. That is the system which this government put in place. It is administered by an independent agency. The methodology is agreed between the states. The states love it when it works in their favour. They cannot complain when it works in the favour of other states and, as far as the Commonwealth is concerned, arguments between the states as to who gets more money out of the GST should be settled between the states; it is not an argument between the Commonwealth and the states.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The first point that I make is that I think it is very important that people in rural and regional and remote areas are fully aware of the various opportunities that the government is creating for them in the area of telecommunications. Indeed, the minister and I visited western New South Wales just last week, and one of the things that I have to say did surprise me and concern me a little was that many people were unaware of the various opportunities that are available for them to tap into. So the first point I make is on our extensive involvement in recent years and our ongoing involvement in upgrading telecommunications for rural people. For example, the latest initiative in terms of the details which are about to be released is $140 million for the wind-out of broadband. This is in response to the Estens inquiry. It is terribly important that we get people to register their interest. As we discovered in Bourke last week, many people are unaware that certain services will be provided on the basis of expressions of interest. In terms of the advertising campaign, as I have just outlined, I see it as legitimate and important. In terms of the standards applied thereto, I have absolutely no doubt that they will be drawn up in accordance with the guidelines.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question and note his very real interest in this matter -  - and his concern to ensure that we manage that very important facility, which generates a great deal of economic activity and a lot of jobs in his electorate, both in an economic sense and in an environmental and amenity sense. The Sydney airport master plan shows very clearly that on current information Sydney airport will be able to cope adequately with Sydney's airport needs for at least the next 20 years -  - without having to tamper in any way - this is very important - with the government's existing noise mitigation measures. Those include the curfew, the movement cap and LTOP. - I want to say that those measures are there to stay. Those noise-sharing arrangements are there to stay. It is very important that the people of Sydney be reassured of that. The master plan is predicated on the basis that those measures will stay there, and I want to say that I certainly would not have approved it if there had been any doubt about those.It ought to be noted that there has been a very significant reduction in total aircraft movements at Sydney airport in recent years. Total aircraft movements in 2000-01 were around 317,000. In 2002-03 they were around 254,000. Very importantly, according to the master plan - this ought to be noted - it will take some five to six years for aircraft movements to reach the levels that they were at in 2000-01, and at about that time there will be an obligation for a review of this master plan because that is what the Airports Act requires.I do want to stress that, while total aircraft movements are projected to increase to 412,000 over the 20-year life of the master plan, they will be able to be accommodated without changing the 80-movements cap, the curfew or the noise-sharing plan. Plans are already well developed for Sydney airport to undertake the necessary upgrades to be able to take larger and quieter aircraft - new generation aircraft such as the new A380 - and there will be no need for any new runways or flight paths -  - The member for Batman, who intercedes now, is saying that the airport - </DOC>

 - The government's position on Telstra has been clear. Telstra can either operate as a nationalised company or Telstra can operate as a company in the private sector. But if anybody thinks that the long-term best interests are served for Telstra or for people using telecommunication services by a 50.1 per cent government-owned enterprise, they would be completely mistaken. We have said that the long-term ownership of Telstra should be resolved, but the government will only be resolving it at a time when the optimum commercial arrangements can be put in place. I make the point, as I have previously, that if the Labor Party, unlike nearly every other Western country, truly believes that we should have a nationalised telecommunications company then it would be offering to renationalise Telstra. But it does not have the decency to actually support that position.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question. I acknowledge the huge support of people in his electorate in coming out to a rally on Sunday to support the Scoresby Freeway - a freeway for which this government has signed a written agreement with the Victorian government, which was promised to the people of the eastern suburbs of Melbourne before the state election. The people of Melbourne and Victoria deserve to have that promise honoured by the Bracks Labor government. There are only two sleeps to go until - A government member - There is only one sleep to go. - It is closer than I thought! - There is only one sleep to go before you can get down to the Bayswater Hotel to hear Peter Lockwood MP, the Labor member for Bayswater, tell you, `Tolls are good. Prove us wrong.' Poor old Peter must be having a bit of trouble attracting a crowd, notwithstanding the fact that I am his greatest spruiker. How many times have I advertised Peter's forum? He has just written to the local councils, including the Maroondah City Council - and the council has sent it on to me. He said to the Maroondah City Council:I have attended many Maroondah functions and at the majority of these I heard the anti-tolls message, even at the mayoral ball - I bet he did - So I ask you to attend my function. Some have called this function a fundraiser - it is not. If it makes money, I will be greatly surprised.It is a bit like the toll road, I suppose. The Bracks government promises you a freeway, then it tells you that you will have to pay, and if you want to know why you have to pay, come along and pay $34 to find out. Gee, I tell you, these blokes have got it covered, haven't they? Yesterday - don't smile Martin. - He knows what is coming. Yesterday Premier Bracks went on radio 3AW and said that under no circumstances will he deliver his promise and build a freeway in the outer east of Melbourne. He said:These are not easy decisions for government. I had to break a promise that I made at the last election. I don't do that lightly. I did it because we had to do it.Steve Bracks openly admits he has broken his promise in respect of the Scoresby Freeway. There is one federal Labor member who has castigated and criticised Premier Bracks for breaking that promise. It is somebody who, on this issue, has integrity - and he is smiling. But there is another member who has not had the courage to stand up to Premier Bracks and to castigate him, and that is the Leader of the Opposition, the man who wants higher parliamentary standards. I have his transcript from radio 3AW on Friday - and guess what? I did not get it off the ALP web site. It is another one of those little transcripts that did not actually make it onto the web site. Let me give the press of Australia a tip: do not go looking at the transcripts he publishes. The ones you want are the ones that never make it onto that web site in the first place. He was taking calls from the public. The caller said:... Mark, the state government and the federal government have a signed memorandum of understanding in relation to the Scoresby Freeway that it will be built without a toll. If you are to become Prime Minister, will you make sure the state adheres to that and the road is built without a toll?That is not a bad question. The answer was:Latham: That is the decision the state government has made in its own right. It is not one that I am seeking to interfere with.The Commonwealth have a signed agreement with the state of Victoria, and a vote for Labor is a vote to let state Labor off that agreement and for Commonwealth Labor to dud the people of the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. The radio interview continued:Mitchell: You agree they have dudded the people of Victoria?Latham: Look, I don't approve of people breaking promises. I don't think that's right in public life. But at the end of the day the states have got to, you know, make their own bed and lie in it.That is a careful choice of words: `the states have got to ... make their own bed and lie in it.' I wonder what way they should lie in it. Should they outright lie in their bed? Should they have a barefaced lie in their bed? The one thing we can be sure of is that they will not have a straight lie in their bed, if they are the Victorian government. At the last federal election, federal Labor said they agreed with us that there should be no tollway and that the Scoresby should be a freeway. At the last state election, state Labor had the same policy. State Labor have broken their promise. You cannot believe state Labor, and if you vote for federal Labor you will get a broken promise too, because there is no standard and no willingness to hold that government accountable.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hotham for his question. I made two points. Quite self-evidently, at the moment - for commercial reasons, as the Treasurer has said - Telstra is not for sale. I also said that we are still rolling out the commitments we made in the Estens report. That is the case. The minister for communications is finalising the broadband strategy. That is the reality. - Our commitment to better regional services stands, and it stands in stark contrast to the ALP's feigned concern about rural telecommunications standards. The one thing I can assert with complete confidence in this place is that no-one in regional Australia believes that the Labor Party give a twopenny damn about the telecommunications standards that they enjoy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his important and timely question. It is important because the rent rort rip-off is one of the most disgraceful examples of bad public administration in Australia's history. It is timely because, since question time yesterday, the fleece meter has ticked up $6,721 - in just one day. Since question time last week, the fleece meter has ticked up more than $80,000. That is $80,000 of ripped-off taxpayers' money which has gone into the pockets of members opposite and their backers. Thanks to the Keating government's money-laundering operation, members opposite enjoy an undeclared $36 million free gift from taxpayers. That is a $36 million head start that members opposite have for the next election. This is probably the greatest swindle in Australia's political history. The great train robber, Ronnie Biggs, would be proud of a heist like this. There he is - the Leader of the Opposition - living off the proceeds.The principal finding of Justice Morling's inquiry into the Centenary House lease concerned an offer of $50,000 that a representative of the ALP made to the Australian Property Group as a so-called agency commission. In chapter 3 of his report Justice Morling found, first, that the $50,000 was offered as an inducement to the Australian Property Group to commit a tenant. He found, second, that the offer ought not to have been made and, third, he found that the offer was made with the knowledge of the Centenary House project control group which included the then ALP national secretary, Bob Hogg. I should point out that Justice Morling concluded that this was a regrettable error, rather than an attempted bribe. Nevertheless, the central finding of Justice Morling's inquiry was that a wrongful offer of $50,000 was made to induce this contract. I note that Justice Morling was handicapped because he was never offered counsel assisting, as is the usual practice.In light of that I note the Senate resolution calling for a new judicial inquiry into the rent rort, a resolution that senators in the ALP were too ashamed to oppose. I note that even Alan Ramsay thinks that the Centenary House rip-off is the stinking dead cat in Labor's backyard. Meanwhile we have the Leader of the Opposition roaming around Australia giving people sermons on ethics, which no-one takes seriously. This is the great Australian role model, is it not, for Penrith Rugby League players, as he roams around giving sermons on personal responsibility? This is what the Leader of the Opposition said last week:The responsibility for fixing our broken politics rests with all politicians.Then he said:None of us are without fault...You can say that again! Then he said:But I believe that social democrats have a special responsibility.He has a special responsibility to end the rent rort, to end the rip-off right now.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question. I know how strongly he supports the MedicarePlus package and the benefits it will deliver to all Australians, including those in his electorate. There are constant calls for increased federal funding of public hospitals, mostly made by state governments I have to say. Let us be very clear: state governments totally run public hospitals; they do not totally fund them. This federal government has done more than its fair share to fund the public hospitals of Australia.Since 1996 federal health spending, as a percentage of Australia's GDP, has risen from 3.7 to 4.3 per cent. At the same time, state health spending has remained static at just two per cent of Australia's GDP. The latest Australian Health Care Agreement, negotiated by my distinguished predecessor, Senator Kay Patterson, provides for a 17 per cent real increase in public hospital funding over the next five years.Let me say this on the question of public hospital funding: people are sick of the blame game. They just want results, and that is what is being delivered by the Howard government. I am very happy to work cooperatively with the state governments to address the interface between GP care and public hospitals and the interface between public hospitals and our nursing homes.Around Australia, the federal government are already supporting nine general practice clinics attached to public hospitals, and we are talking to the states about doing more in cooperation with the divisions of general practice. Last year Senator Patterson committed $253 million to the Pathways Home program - a joint program with the states and territories to free up beds in public hospitals. On the weekend, the government committed $103 million in Pathways funding to 31 new projects right around Australia, including two new mental health facilities in South Australia, a new rehabilitation and convalescent centre in the ACT, two similar centres in Western Australia, an Indigenous convalescent centre in South Australia and 12 community rehabilitation centres - mostly in rural Victoria. We are continuing to work with the New South Wales, Queensland and Northern Territory governments on Pathways Home projects.This government will never play politics with the health of the Australian people. This government believes that health is too important for any politics. This government will continue to do what is necessary and continue to invest what is necessary to protect and strengthen our great Medicare system.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Perth for his question. I think he has overlooked a report. It is called the Gregory report. It was commissioned in 1994. The results of the Gregory report were that the Labor legacy in aged care was such that care standards and quality had fallen to a disgraceful degree. And what did Labor do in relation to the Gregory report? Obviously some members were not here at the time and were not around to hear. The Gregory report, which was such an indictment of Labor, was totally ignored. - It was put in somebody's bottom drawer never to see the light of day - and that is a disgrace. Since coming to office, the Howard government has increased funding in aged care by 100 per cent - from $3 billion to $6 billion. Subsequently, the Howard government commissioned an independent review by Professor Hogan to consider the underlying costs and the capital costs of the aged care sector. And I say again: the Hogan recommendations are with the government and are being considered in the context of the 2004 budget.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan for his question. We do not hear the r-word very often these days - and particularly not from the Australian Labor Party. I noticed in an article in the Canberra Times this morning that the spokesperson for the Labor Party on workplace relations, the member for Rankin, acknowledged that industrial relations was becoming a hot political issue. He is quoted as saying -  - The member for Rankin is quoted as saying:We do have very substantial differences with the government in this industrial relations area.He is too right about that - we agree. What this government is and has been on about is creating jobs for Australians, particularly young Australians. If you look at the government's record, you see that it stands in stark contrast to that of the Labor Party. More than 1.2 million jobs have been created under this government. Under this government we see higher wages for Australians, record productivity and the lowest levels of unemployment in Australia for some two decades. This is no accident and it did not just happen naturally; it has occurred because of the strong, efficient and experienced economic management of this government and it has occurred because of the changes to give more flexibility and choice in the workplace relations system in Australia.The member for Rankin talked about the substantial difference. There is no clearer example of a substantial difference between the government and the Australian Labor Party than Labor's crazy, job-destroying plan to abolish junior rates of pay - something which is in the recently adopted Labor Party platform and something which is simply stupid and does not make sense. It flies in the face of a decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to protect junior rates of pay, but it also flies in the face of the evidence. During the 1998 inquiry into junior rates of pay, the Australian Retailers Association estimated that there would be 200,000 jobs lost in Australia if junior rates of pay were abolished - 200,000 jobs lost in Australia in the retail sector alone.So if the first rung of opportunity for Australians, particularly young Australians, is having a job, here we have a proposition, a proposal and a platform from the Leader of the Opposition which would deny young Australians that opportunity. Let me give an example of a retail business in the ACT. If a business in the ACT employing a 16-year-old worker were faced with the abolition of junior rates of pay - as the Labor Party wants - that would amount to a 100 per cent wage increase for that business. In the retail sector alone, 200,000 jobs would be lost under this crazy, stupid policy from the Leader of the Opposition.The abolition of junior rates of pay would not only destroy tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of jobs in Australia - simply destroy them - but also kill the hopes and aspirations of so many young Australians. A more experienced Leader of the Opposition would never embrace such a crazy policy as the Australian Labor Party has embraced in this. It is no wonder that small business in particular is saying that it is very afraid of the Labor Party. If these policies were ever implemented by a Labor Party in government, it would be a train wreck for the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Can I start by saying that I still hope that the Leader of the Opposition will change the very unfortunate position he has taken on this issue over the past few days. I think it is regrettable that the alternative Prime Minister of this country should be joining in sending the wrong signals at the wrong time. I would ask the Leader of the Opposition, very genuinely, to think again about what he is doing.Our position in relation to the troop deployment has always been quite clear and consistent. It was set out in answer to a question from the member for Solomon on 13 May 2003, when I had this to say:It is not possible at this time to say how long these defence elements, which comprise about 1,200 personnel, - It is now down to 850 - will remain in Iraq, as this will largely be determined by the situation on the ground.On 15 December last year, I had this to say:They will stay while they have a job to do. We're not going to prematurely pull them out. We made a contribution, a very important contribution, during the military conflict and we said we'd maintain a reasonable number thereafter - not a huge number because we have peacekeeping obligations in our part of the world.And, importantly, I said:But we don't intend to pull those troops out until they have done their job.The government's position is very clear. It is right; it is consistent. It is the position of the Leader of the Opposition that is wrong and bad for Australia and sending the wrong signal to the wrong people at the wrong time.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson. It so happens that, as recently as the middle of last November, I did receive a letter - a very well-written and carefully crafted letter; a letter written by somebody who obviously had some first-hand knowledge of the situation - urging the government to strengthen our presence in Iraq. I received this letter and I replied promptly. The letter writer had in fact just come back from Baghdad. He had actually been on the ground. He spoke very warmly of what had been done.I am pleased to inform the House that this letter, dated 17 November 2003, came from none other than the shadow minister for foreign affairs, the member for Griffith. It is a very good letter, but let me share with the House a couple of the points that were made in the letter. He said, inter alia:You will be aware that the federal opposition oppose the war, but now that regime change has occurred in Baghdad it is the opposition's view that it is now the responsibility of all people of goodwill, both in this country and beyond, to put their shoulder to the wheel in an effort to build a new Iraq.He then went on to say:It is our view that this is particularly incumbent on Australia, given our role as an occupying power - a role which you confirmed in your statement of 17 April.The member for Griffith then went on to put forward five propositions, all designed to improve the situation on the ground in Iraq. I am very happy to remind the member for Griffith that a number of those propositions he put forward to the government were in fact acted upon by the government - I am not saying solely because of the member for Griffith, but certainly the member for Griffith was very concerned about providing more trainers for the Iraqi army. He wanted more trainers for the Iraqi police. He even wanted the Australian Electoral Commission to be sent to Iraq to help in the preparations for the forthcoming elections. I am able to report that we have done quite a number of those things. Importantly, he went on in his letter to say:Could I emphasise that, for the several hundred Australian staff still in Iraq - These are the words of the member for Griffith - the war has not moved on for them at all. Iraq very much remains a war zone and it is likely to remain so for some considerable time.This is the member for Griffith - the alternative foreign minister of Australia. In his view, four months ago Iraq was still a war zone, yet in the view of the Leader of the Opposition it will be fit for a total troop withdrawal by Australia by 30 June this year. One of them has to be wrong, and on this occasion my money is on the member for Griffith. I think the member for Griffith understands the situation. The member for Griffith has been there, he is aware of our international obligations and he wrote me a very carefully crafted letter. It was a letter from a man who understood his brief. He was across the details. He knew the implications of what he was saying, and so did the former Leader of the Opposition. The former Leader of the Opposition - who grins in acknowledgement - got onto him pretty smartly and said, `Careful, Kevin, you're sending the wrong message.' What was happening was that that the member for Griffith understood that if Australia wanted to discharge our broad international obligations we were going to have to stay in Iraq for a while longer. That is why he must be aghast at the Leader of the Opposition abandoning caution and arguing for an early return, when manifestly the circumstances requiring that and suggesting that simply are not there.I say again to the Leader of the Opposition that the government would welcome a change of heart by him. We would endorse, as an act of leadership, the Leader of the Opposition changing his position. The Leader of the Opposition talks about an exit strategy. I say on behalf of the government: we do not have a cut and run strategy. It is not the Australian way to cut and run. It is the Australian way to stay and do the job and see it through, and that is what we intend to do. I table a copy of the correspondence from which I was quoting.</DOC>

 - If my recollection serves me correctly, 10 April 2003 was a great day for the people of Iraq. That was the day that the statue of Saddam Hussein was toppled - an act that would never have occurred on 10 April if the advice of the member for Griffith and others had been taken. Let me simply say to the member for Griffith: any attempt to wriggle out of your leader's indiscretion by making allegations about the Minister for Foreign Affairs and me will be rejected with the contempt that it deserves. We have never set a withdrawal date. We have always said that it will depend on circumstances on the ground. That should be your attitude. - The member for Griffith writes better than he interjects. The member for Griffith had his hand on it; he knew what had to be done - more power to his arm. It is a great pity that the Leader of the Opposition does not take notice of the member for Griffith. But then it may have something to do with the fact that the Leader of the Opposition's great mentor - Danger Man up there - covets somebody's job.</DOC>

 - First of all, may I thank the honourable member for his question and say how much I appreciate the honourable member for Herbert's interest. After all, he represents a large number of Australian defence personnel up in Townsville. We appreciate and he appreciates the tremendous job they have done. Some of those people are, no doubt, included in our contingents in Iraq.Obviously, the terrorist attack in Madrid on 11 March was a fundamentally important moment in the war against terrorism, and it was a moment when leaders around the world reflected. I think it is worth looking at some of the statements they have made about their commitments to Iraq since the Madrid terrorist bombing. There is not just a small number - there are 35 involved. Jack Straw, my British counterpart, the British Foreign Secretary, said on 23 March:So we walk out of Iraq, abandon Afghanistan. Does anyone think that this would satisfy their - that is, the terrorists - appetite? Of course not. Their appetite would simply be whetted, for it is insatiable.The Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Koizumi, said on 15 March: `The result of Spain's general election will not change Japan's basic position of supporting international efforts to stabilise and rebuild Iraq.' The Italian foreign minister, Mr Fratini, said on 18 March: `International support for a free and democratic Iraq must continue. An international military complement is still necessary.' The Polish Prime Minister, Prime Minister Miller, said on 15 March: `Revising our position on Iraq after terrorist attacks would be to admit that terrorists are stronger and that they are right to pursue attacks.' The NATO Secretary General, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, said on 21 March: `This is not a good moment to withdraw forces from Iraq.'The position that opposition leaders take on this issue is very important, bearing in mind what happened in Spain and in the Spanish election. Opposition leaders in countries that have given a commitment to troops in Iraq have reinforced their support. The leader of the British Conservative Party, the opposition leader, Michael Howard - no relation of the Prime Minister - said:Countries cannot insulate themselves from terrorist attack by opting out of the War on Terror. We cannot buy ourselves immunity by changing our foreign policy. Apart from the moral cowardice of that position, it can never work in practice.Senator John Kerry, who you could say is the de facto leader of the opposition in the United States of America, said:To leave (Iraq) too soon would leave behind a failed state that inevitably would become a haven for terrorists.He called on the Prime Minister designate of Spain, Mr Zapatero, to reconsider his decision to withdraw troops, which could send the wrong signal.The member for Herbert asked if there were alternative views. One of the most significant alternative views to the views that I have been quoting is the view of the Spanish Prime Minister elect, Mr Zapatero. He has reiterated his intention, following the Madrid bombing, to pull his 1,300 troops out of Iraq, but that commitment is only conditional. He said that he would allow the troops to remain if they came under United Nations control and the United Nations were placed in charge of a political transition by 30 June. This view has also been articulated by the Honduran defence secretary, Mr Breve, because the Honduran troops are implanted with the Spanish troops in Iraq. The Leader of the Opposition, should he become the Prime Minister of Australia, would therefore have a unique position of all of the 35 countries involved in providing stabilisation forces in Iraq. We would be the only country which had decided to cut and run without any conditions at all. The Spanish have a condition on which they will stay, which is that under United Nations leadership they would continue their troops in Iraq. But, under the Leader of the Opposition's proposal, he says there is no condition; they just leave.I can only repeat what I have said for the last two days. The Leader of the Opposition said in December that he would not consider a decision on the troops in Iraq until he had had a briefing from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and from the Department of Defence. I wrote to the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, offering that briefing yet again. Not surprisingly, I have had no reply to my letter. My department has had no contact from his office for that briefing. I implore the Leader of the Opposition to get himself properly briefed on these issues, to understand the issues, before running off and making instant policy on the run. If this policy is to be maintained by the Leader of the Opposition, it will be damaging not only for Australia but also for the overall international effort to achieve a stable and democratic country in Iraq.</DOC>

 - It is not for me to argue with General Cosgrove. I asked the Prime Minister what was the point of the question. I am sorry, I just do not know the point of the question. I think General Cosgrove is a good man and a strong man - a man who has shown a lot of courage. I think this country has always been a country that has shown a lot of courage and a lot of strength.  - I repeat what I said: I can only implore the Leader of the Opposition to think this through a bit more. It sounds as though Hawker Britton or someone may have come up with this policy, but he needs to think about it himself and get those briefings - that would be good.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The honourable member has visited Iraq herself and has a pretty clear understanding of what our Defence Force personnel do there. She and I both met with them outside the Australian Representative Office in Baghdad in May last year, so she knows only too well what an excellent job those defence personnel are doing to provide essential protection for the Australian Representative Office and the accommodation of the officers who work there. Obviously, and importantly, they provide a physical deterrent. The ADF have done an outstanding job in Baghdad of winning over the local community around where the Australian Representative Office is located, not just through patrols but by doing the sorts of things that the ADF often do very well - helping with community activities such as rehabilitating the local kindergarten and helping the local police. Importantly, their duties also involve providing armed escorts for Australian Defence Force personnel as they move around Iraq and particularly around Baghdad. I point out also that the Royal Australian Air Force aircraft provide a secure air link in and out of the country for our diplomats and for our officials. Even the member for Griffith may have flown into Iraq courtesy of the Royal Australian Air Force. I know that the member for Pearce and I and others have done so. They do an excellent job there in the absence of safe commercial services.The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advise me that, in the current security circumstances in Iraq, a withdrawal of the Australian Defence Force personnel would require Australia to close its mission in Iraq. It is conceivable that you could withdraw the Australian Defence Force personnel and just leave the mission there, but that is not the advice of my department and on security issues I always take the advice of my department. I assume that, if the government were to change in this country, my successor would do exactly the same thing. I do not think anyone would ever leave personnel in a place of danger against the advice of their department. Our diplomats in Iraq are doing an outstanding job. As I mentioned yesterday, they are promoting our interests in all sorts of ways. They are of course promoting security and political interests, but importantly they are also promoting our commercial interests. They are helping the Australian Wheat Board, who had the Iraqi Grains Board here a day or two ago. They are helping companies like Worley, Australian companies in the oil industry, to get jobs and make progress in Iraq. There are great opportunities for Australian businesses there.I do not see the sense in pulling our mission out of Iraq because of some political commitment to ending the presence of the 85 soldiers there who are protecting those diplomats. I think if the Leader of the Opposition had had a briefing - he promised he would have a briefing before he made a decision but decided not to bother in the end, for reasons that are not entirely clear to the rest of us and perhaps not even to the shadow cabinet, by the way, because I do not think this was discussed at the shadow cabinet meeting - he would understand that this would be one of the consequences of what, frankly, is an ill-considered proposition. Once more I say to the Leader of the Opposition that he should get the briefing, learn something about the issues and, once he is on top of the issues, think through what might be a good policy.</DOC>

 - I have seen the Leader of the Opposition's statements. There are certain legal processes involved, and whatever my personal view or, indeed, the view of the Leader of the Opposition - he does not have executive responsibility; I do - I am constrained from expressing those views. The minister is handling the matter very competently. The proper legal processes will be followed, and I am not going to make statements that might undermine the efficacy of those procedures.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. I can inform him that the Reserve Bank has published for the first time a financial stability review, in common with the practice which has been adopted by a number of central banks around the world. It says:... that the Australian financial system is currently in good shape. Banks ... are in a particularly strong financial position: they are profitable, carry few bad debts and hold capital considerably in excess of their minimum regulatory requirements. This outcome is largely the legacy of the long-running expansion of the domestic economy.The Reserve Bank is saying that the expansion of the domestic economy and the profitability that we are now seeing in Australia have contributed to a very strong financial position for the Australian financial system, particularly for banks. The report goes on to note that many households have increased their borrowings in recent years and finds that there are two reasons for this. The first is that the appetite for borrowing has increased because inflation and interest rates have been low. The second is that the banks have sought to lend more to individuals because they perceive this as an area of growth for them. The Reserve Bank notes that default rates are very low and that there are few signs that households are having difficulty meeting their interest requirements, with around 60 per cent of households ahead of required payments on the primary mortgage - which I think would surprise a lot of people. But the bank does have some warnings. It says that, because individuals have increased their borrowings, if we were to have a return to large and unexpected increases in interest rates, as we had in the late 1980s, that would damage the household sector. It also says that, if household incomes were disrupted by rising unemployment, as was the case in the late 1980s, we would find the situation much more fragile.Bearing in mind those admonitions, it is important that Australia does avoid large and unexpected increases in interest rates or a large drop in employment and a large rise in unemployment. This is what economic management should be focused on. It should be strong and consistent. We need to keep our budget balanced. If we were to return to the kinds of deficits the Labor Party ran through the early 1990s, we would be exposing Australians to interest rate rises and we might also give them the double whammy of unexpected rises in unemployment.Managing the economy and keeping the Australian economy growing is the first priority of economic policy in this country. It takes disciplined, determined and consistent policy. As the Reserve Bank notes, if that were not to prevail then Australia and Australians would be very exposed. That is why it is important that those who are managing economic policy continue to manage it with consistency and coherence and with the kind of purpose that this government has shown over the last eight years, rather than the air bubble approach to economic policy making of here today and gone tomorrow - airbrushed out on the web site before anybody can be held accountable. That is not the kind of economic management which would be suitable to take Australians, their mortgages and their children into the future.</DOC>

 - Even though I am at a disadvantage to the Leader of the Opposition - I do not carry around in my head or in my hand those financial comparisons - I will say something about the question of need. The government's policy in relation to independent schools is one based on an unswerving commitment to freedom of choice for Australian parents. You can be absolutely certain that one principle that will not be deviated from while ever I am Prime Minister of this country is a passionate belief in the right of parents to choose what school they send their children to. We believe that every parent who sends a child to an independent school takes a load off the general taxpayer. As the Leader of the Opposition knows, there is already a needs based funding system in place, and that needs based funding system essentially says that, in relation to certain schools, you have a base amount of support and then, depending on the need of the school and the parents, that support will rise. In some cases the level of Commonwealth government support is about 13 to 14 per cent as a proportion of the cost of educating a child at a government school, and it will rise to something like 70 per cent in relation to the very poor Catholic parish schools and some of the poorer independent schools.I think that is a very good system. It is a system that results in 76 per cent of all government money for schools going to the 68 per cent of children who attend government schools. It is a system that has given unrivalled choice to Australian parents. It is a system that recognises the choice of Australian parents, which is increasingly, particularly at a secondary level, to take advantage of the option, if they wish to, of sending their children to non-government schools.I am very proud of our existing funding arrangements. They are based on the principle of freedom of choice. Once you start interfering with them, it is the thin end of the wedge. Take away from the parents of some independent schools and the parents of other independent schools will know that they may well be next in the rearrangement of Commonwealth government support.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. I know, his coming from the Northern Territory, which is participating in the most ambitious and largest counter-terrorism exercise we have had in Australia - Mercury 04 - that that is of interest to him, his constituents and many of the personnel who have been participating in it. This is the first of five counter-terrorism exercises for this year. Mercury 04 has put to test counter-terrorism arrangements in four jurisdictions - the Northern Territory, Tasmania, South Australia and Victoria - as well as a number of very important Australian government agencies. The deployment phase of Mercury 04 officially ends tomorrow and it has presented a range of complex terrorism scenarios including - and I thought members of the opposition might be interested in this - a simulated attack by terrorists on an offshore facility, a simulated bomb blast, a high-profile kidnapping, a hostage situation and other incidents and attacks across four states and territories.The important aspect about an exercise of this sort is that if Australia - God forbid - were ever to face incidents of this sort, the personnel, staff and those who are to be involved in dealing with such issues need to know how to deal with them, need to be prepared for them and need to know what steps should be followed. They need to be familiar with all of the exigencies that such a disastrous set of circumstances might leave us facing. There has been a high level of commitment from the Australian government and state and territory agencies who have a role in security, law enforcement, intelligence and emergency management. I would like to thank the Governor-General, the Prime Minister, my ministerial colleagues, their staff, departments and agencies, who have participated so willingly in relation to this particular exercise.We recognise also the cooperation that has been shown by state and territory counterparts, including Premiers and Chief Ministers, and all government departments and agencies whose hard work has ensured that the exercise is as real as it can be. While it is not yet over, I can say that it has been a most valuable exercise, as we have focused on and put into practice not only operational responses to major terrorist incidents but also the critical decision making processes set up specifically to deal with potential events of this sort.The tragedy of the recent bombings in Spain should serve as a wake-up call for those who thought we should relax against the threat of terrorism. I think Australians can be confident that the training and resources of our agencies to protect Australia from a variety of threats are first class. I think Australians can also be assured by the high level of cooperation and the preparation that exists across all jurisdictions - a fact that I believe has been well and truly demonstrated during this week and during the course of the exercise Mercury 04.</DOC>

 - The simple answer to that question is no, I have no recollection of such an event having occurred. I do certainly recall the questions in the House which I responded to fully and frankly at that time. I am not aware of the subsequent incident that the shadow minister refers to, but this is just typical of the Labor Party's campaign against ethanol. On the one hand we have the Leader of the Opposition going up to North Queensland saying that he supports ethanol, but whenever he comes into this place the message is entirely different. He has been a part of the campaign to undermine ethanol as an industry that offers considerable potential in rural and regional Australia. You cannot have it both ways. You go up to North Queensland and say that you support it and then you come down here and do everything you can to undermine its potential.</DOC>

 - Members opposite call out `boring', but what they mean is `embarrassing'. That is what they mean. It is very embarrassing for them. I thank the member for Mackellar for her question and for the assiduous way she keeps the Centenary House fleece meter in her office and marks it up by $6,721 every single day. Nine days after the Leader of the Opposition entered his current high office, he was giving one of his little sermons to schoolkids and he said, `Be true to the things you believe in.' And he believes in Centenary House. He says, `You've got to go to bed at night thinking, 'I'm being true to the reasons I got into this in the first place'.' When he came into this parliament in 1994 the Centenary House rivers of gold were already flowing into the Labor Party's coffers.As someone whose first act as Mayor of Liverpool Council was to double his salary, of course he supports the Centenary House rip-off. As someone who came into this House to get the top job, of course he supports the $36 million free gift from taxpayers to the Labor Party. Of course he supports the $36 million electoral head start which Centenary House gives the Labor Party. In an election year, he would rather spend on a million posters of himself the $4 million above market rent which the Labor Party gets rather than spend it on 155,000 extra general practice consultations or 374,000 flu shots for pensioners.At $871 a square metre, Centenary House makes Barton the world's most expensive real estate. When it comes to astronomical rents, there is Hong Kong, Seoul, Washington, Geneva and Barton. With rents like this, you would think that office space in Barton was highly sought-after. I am advised by real estate agents familiar with the market that they can hardly give space away in Barton, apart from Centenary House. Two doors down from Centenary House, Engineering House is 30 per cent empty - just two doors down. Right opposite Centenary House, the Computer Associates building's ground floor is empty. To get tenants to take space, even at $300 a square metre, real estate agents have to throw in free parking, at $7,000 a spot; free fit-out, at hundreds of thousands of dollars; and free security, at tens of thousands of dollars.What all this means is that Centenary House remains an obscene monument to political greed. Come September, when the `ratchet clause' kicks in, the `fleece meter' will not be going up by $6,721 a day; it will be going up by $10,955 every single day. The Leader of the Opposition is quite shameless; he has more front than Mark Foy's. Just last week, he said, `Our program of democratic renewal relies on more open government and higher ethical standards.' The fraud! The fake! The only thing he wants to renew is not our politics: it is the Centenary House lease. That is the only thing he wants to renew so that the Labor Party can continue its despicable political get-rich-quick scheme.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. I can inform him and members of the House that nearly 500,000 Australian workplace agreements have been approved in Australia since they came into operation -  - and are now the employment vehicle for 12 per cent of employees covered by federal agreements. These are what the Australian Labor Party wish to abolish. This policy of the Labor Party is something on which businesses big and small and business organisations throughout Australia are lining up to reject. This was summarised in an article in this week's Business Review Weekly entitled `Unions at the gate', in which the author said:For employers, opposition to AWAs is just another sign that political and industrial Labor wants to turn back the clock on workplace reform.As I said yesterday, Mr Hugh Morgan, the head of the Business Council of Australia - the organisation that represents 100 of the largest companies in Australia, which employ some one million workers - has said:I think AWAs have made a significant contribution to the industrial scene ... there's a widespread freedom in terms of making arrangements between employers and employees ... much more than we've seen in the past, and it's resulted in a significant increase in job satisfaction and productivity growth in the country.That is the attitude of the Business Council towards this ridiculous proposal from the Labor Party to abolish Australian workplace agreements. The Victorian Chamber of Commerce was quoted in the same article in the Business Review Weekly about Labor's policy. They described it as `a significant step backwards'. Just last week, BHP Billiton - one of Australia's largest companies, one of the major contributors to the resource sector in this country and a major employer in Australia - said through a spokesman:The resources sector is greatly concerned that flexibilities offered by the current legislative provisions, such as those enabling direct forms of employment arrangements, must not be eroded.Australian workplace agreements bring direct benefits to employees in Australia. Recent ABS data reveals that workers on AWAs receive an average weekly wage of $1,001.10 compared to $731.40 for those on certified agreements. In other words, on average, those on AWAs are receiving 35 per cent more than those on certified agreements. Who objects to that? - The member for Hotham objects to it - the entire Labor Party does. Why? It is because the Labor Party is basically being paid by the union bosses, who have donated $40 million to the Australian Labor Party. It objects to Australian workplace agreements because the union bosses are removed from the bargaining process. That is the Australian Labor Party's simple ideological objection to AWAs.I was asked about alternatives. I noticed that in the Bendigo Advertiser yesterday the member for Rankin, the opposition spokesperson on workplace relations, said that Labor preferred common law contracts instead of AWAs and that they would provide ample flexibility for workers and employees. May I say to him and to members of the House that, as a matter of law and as a matter of practice, common law contracts cannot offer and are not capable of offering the flexibilities that are offered by Australian workplace agreements. The member for Rankin is either misleading the Australian public with that comment or, like the Leader of the Opposition, is simply not across the detail of the proposal. One of the major reasons for the prosperity that this country has enjoyed over the last few years has been the flexibility and choice that employers and employees have at the workplace. The prosperity of Australia has not happened by chance or by accident; it has happened because of the policies and the programs that this government has put in place. Australia and Australians cannot afford the radical ideas of the Leader of the Opposition, who simply does not understand the impact of his proposals on the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. I recognise his great interest in increasing the level of exports out of Australia, particularly out of Western Australia and his rather large electorate of Kalgoorlie, which contributes significantly to the Australian economy. He also recognises the enormous opportunities that will present themselves to Australian exporters right across this nation as a result of the free trade agreement that we have negotiated with the United States when it enters into force. The FTA will obviously create an enormous number of opportunities in the economic growth of the Australian economy but, most importantly, the opportunity for more jobs - more jobs for Australians right across the breadth of the economy - and there is no doubt that that is in the national interest.The member for Kalgoorlie asked about levels of support required for this. Here in Australia we look forward to the support of the Labor Party for something that is going to deliver more jobs for the Australian community and see growth in the Australian economy. That support will be necessary for the passage of enabling legislation through both houses of the parliament. It will also be important to see bipartisan support in sending a very strong signal to the United States Congress and the US administration. It will mean that Australian business can take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to access the largest economy in the world and one of the most dynamic economies in the world. So far we have seen a lack of understanding from the Australian Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition on the importance of this opportunity in terms of the national interest, developing jobs, wealth creation and economic growth and development in Australia.I read an article this week in the Macarthur Advertiser - which isin the Leader of the Opposition's electorate - in which the Leader of the Opposition was talking about the disposition of the Australian Labor Party not to send troops to Iraq and, in the same breath, talking about free trade agreements. He said that he would never have sent troops even if it jeopardised free trade agreements. He went on to say: I think it is a bad suggestion to say we should send people off to fight wars and risk their lives for the sake of trade agreements.Guess what: we did not and we never would. We basically agree with that sentiment. The Leader of the Opposition was trailing out a dead cat - that there was a link between going to Iraq and negotiating a free trade agreement. We started pursuing the free trade agreement with the United States straight after the US election in 2001. We find the inference in those comments outrageous and offensive. We are pursuing the completion of this free trade agreement with the United States on its economic merits - for what it will do for the Australian economy and what it will do for jobs in this country for generations to come. I encourage the Australian Labor Party to think about the national interest, to put the national interest first and to start thinking about the next generation of Australians, not just the next election.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ryan not only for the question but also for his interest in all the people of Ryan, particularly the unemployed. This morning I was in Sydney launching Mature Age Month, a very key initiative of this government to assist mature age workers back into the work force and to encourage employers to see why mature age workers can make a very positive contribution to the workplace. - The facts are that mature age workers are less likely to take sick leave, are less likely to be absent from the workplace, are a stabilising influence on the workplace and add to productivity. These are very important initiatives which are supported by this government through things like the job seeker account and the mature age training account. With such an initiative, in April we will be going out to the employers of this country and saying: `Give a mature age job seeker a go. Get to work for the Job Network, combine the two and give these people a go. They deserve a go.' The fact is that today we have some 70,000 mature age unemployed people who are on unemployment benefits. They are people who want a job but feel that they cannot get work because they are being discriminated against. You have to ask yourself: why would they feel discriminated against? - The reality is that you only have to go back a few short years to when, under a Labor government, it was almost Labor policy to push people into redundancies, push them out the door once they got over 50 years of age and push them into disability support pensions, because if you did that it took them off the unemployment figure. We see the shadow Treasurer over there with his hand on his jaw because he is the man who was responsible for that when he was the former employment minister. He is a man who said, `How can I protect the Labor government of the day? I know what we'll do: we'll push people into redundancies; we'll put them on the disability support pension; we'll tell them they're not worth anything.' There is not a person on this side of the House who thinks anything but positive things about mature age workers. This side of the House has set a target. We are here to support mature age workers back into the work force because of the positive contribution they can make to the economy and because they want to be able to be independent and supply the sustenance they need for their families. The Job Network will stand ready with the Howard government to support mature age workers, not only in April but throughout the year.</DOC>

 - I do not know. I literally do not know. But I will, as always, make inquiries, and if there is anything that should be added it will be added. But there is no argument that Manildra has made donations to all political parties. I am not ashamed of that, The Nationals are not ashamed of it and, of course, the former Leader of the Opposition was not ashamed of it. On 2 November 2001 - who would have been the Leader of the Opposition then: it would have been the member for Brand - I think Mr Honan had a meeting with the Leader of the Opposition in which the then Leader of the Opposition pledged to support -  -  - No, this is about the ethanol industry. The then Leader of the Opposition pledged to support the ethanol industry, and I note that in that year Manildra gave $55,000 to the Australian Labor Party. Can I just make a salient point for the record? - I think I get the thrust. I think the thrust is that we have done favours for Manildra. Can I remind the member for Fraser that the greatest request that Manildra has persistently made of this government is to mandate a certain level of ethanol consumption, and we have persistently refused to do that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question -  - and for the recently very good work that is shown to be being done at the Tom Quinn Centre of the Salvation Army in Bundaberg, taking young people from drug addiction through to training, jobs, careers and lives of hope.As at the end of December last year, we now have 407,000 apprentices in this country. That is a 10 per cent increase over the past year. Commencements have increased to 283,000, which is a six per cent increase. And, most importantly, in traditional trades we had a six per cent increase in commencements in the quarter from the end of September last year - and more than half of those are young Australians, people under the age of 25 who are training and acquiring skills from which they will earn a living and be able to support themselves and their families and help build this country. I am asked about alternative policies and it is quite instructive to see the way the Australian Labor Party is actually working.  - That is a misnomer. I apologise to the House if I am misleading the House in that regard. It is very interesting to see the way the Labor Party is approaching the issues of training in Australia - and in particular the pricing of them. For example, the Labor Party is railing against the possibility that university graduates, when they have finished university, might have to pay up to 25 per cent more back through the tax system for their university education, to which the taxpayer has contributed three-quarters of the cost, and not pay a cent back until they are earning $36,000 a year. And yet there is not a word being said about changes to TAFE fees. For TAFE, students have to pay at the gate. They cannot get into TAFE until they have paid their TAFE fees and paid them up front. More than a quarter of the students who attend TAFE throughout Australia come from the poorest socioeconomic status suburbs in the country.So a family in Green Valley writes to the Leader of the Opposition - and has two children. The first wants to do economics at Sydney University and the family is concerned about the possibility that the student might pay back $20,000 through the tax system once they have had their university education and in the first year will earn at least $37,000 - and the Leader of the Opposition says, `Get the member for Jagajaga out there. We have to campaign against this. There's no way we want people training to be lawyers and doctors and economists paying any more for their education whilst the taxpayer is paying for three-quarters of it.' For the brother of the student from Green Valley though, who wants to go to the South West Institute of TAFE to do electrical engineering, there is a 188 per cent increase in fees that have to be paid up-front with a family credit card and an interest rate of 16 per cent - and what does the Leader of the Opposition do? Not a word. He says, `Go and see the member for Macarthur if you want something done about that.' The situation is so desperate for these families -  - that the president of the TAFE teachers' federation and the president of the Australian Education Union has come to see me to say, `Noone will support us.' They are getting no support whatsoever from the Labor Party to stand up for poor struggling families who cannot get their kids into TAFE throughout Australia. There is a 300 per cent increase in TAFE fees in New South Wales, 25 per cent in Victoria - and what do I hear from the Labor Party on that? Nothing - 50 per cent in the state of South Australia, and the Labor Party has nothing to say. You might think you are driving a social justice truck -  - but they do not give a damn for poor people that have to pay up-front to get into TAFE.</DOC>

 - I take the opportunity in reply to the member for Aston of reiterating our position. Our position is that all elements of the ADF should remain in Iraq and in the Iraqi theatre until their job is done. That is our position. That is the position which is in the best interests of the Australian people. That is why I will be handing to the Clerk a notice of motion to be moved on the next day of sitting that, firstly, this House expresses its continued support for and confidence in the 850 Australian Defence Force personnel currently deployed in or around Iraq and records its deep appreciation for the outstanding professionalism they have displayed in carrying out their duties and, secondly and importantly, this House is of the opinion that no elements of this contingent of the Australian Defence Force should be withdrawn until their respective tasks have been completed and that no arbitrary times should be set for such withdrawal.The member for Aston asks me: are there any alternatives? There are many alternatives, but all of them have come from the one man - that is, the Leader of the Opposition. Last Tuesday the Leader of the Opposition declared on the Mike Carlton radio program that they would be home by Christmas. So as not to leave anybody in any doubt, he then wanted to make it clear that, even if they were asked by the new Iraqi government to stay, if he were Prime Minister the troops would be brought home. By Thursday of last week, on the way home, he was in effect arguing that they should be diverted to Afghanistan. On Friday he was arguing that they were needed back in Australia for the defence of Australia. Despite the fact that we already have 52,000 ADF personnel in this country, he was arguing that 850 were needed for the defence of Australia. But he apparently forgot the 450 in East Timor and the 500 in the Solomon Islands. Are they required for the defence of Australia as well? By Saturday morning his spokeswoman was asserting: `Maybe we won't bring them all back. We'll only bring back those that are inside Iraq.' - By this morning, the Leader of the Opposition had gone back to asserting that, 12 months ago, a Labor shadow cabinet had decided that a Labor government would bring the troops home immediately. That is what he said - that they decided 12 months ago. I can say to the Leader of the Opposition, through you, Mr Speaker, that if that was decided 12 months ago the member for Griffith was not at the meeting and, having not been at the meeting, he was not informed. As recently as 15 March this year, speaking on the Lateline program, the member for Griffith was asked:Would a Labor government do the same thing as its Spanish counterparts?The member for Griffith replied:... that Spain's troop withdrawal would occur unless the UN assumes sovereignty or a direct role in Iraq as of 1 July this year. That's the report that I've seen.The member for Griffith went on to say:I think our position will be something along these lines, Tony.In other words, what the member for Griffith was saying was not that there was an unconditional Labor Party commitment to withdraw; rather the member for Griffith was maintaining the more principled position that he has had now since last November when he wrote to me saying that we should be doing more rather than less in Iraq, when he wrote and said that we had an obligation to put our shoulder to the wheel, when he wrote and said that we should send additional trainers for the Iraqi army and the Iraqi police force. Those additional trainers are being sent, partly as a result of the representations made by the member for Griffith, and I can inform the House that, as indicated in February this year, the contingent of Australian trainers will be in place in May of this year. Yet, according to the doctrine of the Leader of the Opposition, which is that you have got to pull them out as soon as there is a transfer of authority - which is scheduled to take place on 30 June - those trainers would arrive in May and go in June. That is the absurdity of the position that the Leader of the Opposition has got himself into. The reality is that he made that policy up on the run. He made it up on Tuesday morning and he has been trying ever since to cast around for the odd word here, the odd phrase over there, to try and justify it. But this is too serious to be left to the interviews of the Leader of the Opposition, and that is why the Labor Party will have an opportunity in this parliament in a formal considered way to declare its position, to indicate whether it agrees with the government - whether it agrees with Senator Kerry, the Democrat candidate in the United States; whether it agrees with the British Labour Prime Minister, Tony Blair, as well as the British Conservative opposition leader, Michael Howard; and whether it agrees with the other 34 nations which have forces in Iraq - that this is not the time to cut and run. This is the time to stand firm with our allies and our friends. This is not a time for capricious policy-making on the run which is plainly against the interests of the people of Iraq. It is against the interests of the people of Australia, it gives comfort and encouragement to the terrorists and it is a thoroughly bad policy all round.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I see the member for Lilley is at it again. His mantra is to put as much fear as possible into many vulnerable Australians, particularly those receiving some type of social security payment from the government. This is a constant pattern that the member for Lilley relishes, putting out this innuendo. I have to say this government has a very proud record when it comes to assisting people with disabilities or assisting people who are on carers allowance.  - It is interesting that the member expresses so much concern but the one area this government has been trying to reform is particularly to assist people on disability support pension, and every measure that we put up to the Senate is rejected by the member for Lilley and the Australian Labor Party. When it comes to carers allowance, it is this government that introduced carers allowance a number of years ago. We have a very proud record on it. As far as other measures are concerned, this government has no intention of cutting back welfare payments. Indeed, this government has been the one looking after the most vulnerable in this country.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. I know his interest reflects the interest in this issue that a lot of people in the electorate of Boothby have. At the end of last week I told my department that I would like them to be available to brief the Leader of the Opposition should he wish to be briefed on the issue of withdrawal of troops from Iraq. Not surprisingly - I do not suppose this will come as a shock to the House - we did not hear a word from the Leader of the Opposition, nor has he had the courtesy to acknowledge the letter I sent to him. If he had got himself briefed, he would understand why some of the commentators - in fact, I would say overwhelmingly the commentators who comment on Australian foreign policy and defence issues - have spent the weekend attacking the Leader of the Opposition. He is obviously not briefed. Professor Babbage, who sometimes criticises the government and sometimes takes the same view and is seen as a pretty independent commentator, made this comment:In the wake of Madrid, words can be bullets. Any suggestion we are going to withdraw the troops before the job is done could give the impression Australia is weakening.Of course, the impressions are the important thing here. It gives the impression of Australia cutting and running. Brigadier Jim Wallace, who I think has from time to time been quoted by members on the other side of the House, is quoted as saying:... I am concerned it could make our people more vulnerable. It invites the terrorists to think they've had a victory.I also attended a conference on Friday put on by AmCham in Adelaide and even Trevor Flugge, who had been a senior Australian representative in Iraq and responsible for agriculture policy in the early days of the CPA, said publicly it was too early for Australian troops to be withdrawn. The people who matter most of all in this debate are the Iraqi people, and the Iraqi people clearly do not support the withdrawal of troops either. In a recent BBC sponsored Oxford Research International poll, only 15 per cent of Iraqis wanted troops to go early. I think that is very significant. The honourable member for Boothby asked whether there were any alternative policies. The fact is that in the course of the last week the Labor Party has had five that I have counted. I am not sure of the Prime Minister's figure, but I have counted five different policies on the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. First of all, there was the original position of the member for Griffith. His position, which seemed to be the default position this time last week - that is, on Monday of last week - was that countries like Australia should put their shoulders to the wheel in order to build a new Iraq. Australia should put its shoulder to the wheel - that was the position of the Labor Party, we thought, on the basis of what the spokesman said last Monday. On Tuesday, out came the Leader of the Opposition's new policy - there was no discussion with the shadow cabinet, and apparently he did not even brief the caucus - on 2UE, while he was talking to Mike Carlton. By the way, this is the same policy that Bob Brown espoused in his 10-point plan for the new Leader of the Opposition, which is an interesting coincidence, because the Leader of the Opposition had been with him in the Styx forest just the week before. This was the policy that the troops ought to be out by the middle of the year but, in any case, if Labor were to win an election before the end of the year they would be home by Christmas.Then there was the most extraordinary and bizarre series of events surrounding the Age newspaper on Saturday and Sunday. In the Age on Saturday, a spokeswoman for the Leader of the Opposition said that the Labor Party plans to pull all troops out of Iraq, but not HMAS Melbourne or the aircrews in the gulf, and it would reconsider the security detail protecting the Australian diplomats. That was a completely different position from the position that the Leader of the Opposition had been arguing earlier in the week. We were told that the HMAS Melbourne and the aircrews were going to remain and the security detail in Baghdad might remain as well, but the Leader of the Opposition said on the previous day:... we are going to be much safer as a nation if we have our troops here instead of on the other side of the world.What troops here? The briefing given to the Age- was written up by a very reputable journalist who always checks her facts, if you know who I mean. According to this latest Labor policy, we need the air traffic controllers back here to make Australia a safer country. They are good people - there is no reflection on them - but we have 52,000 Australian Defence Force personnel here. To bring 60 or so air traffic controllers back is probably not going to make the difference between make or break for whether we survive as a nation. But this is the proposition we are all being expected to believe. Anyway, that was the weekend position. This morning we had the member for Griffith again refining the position in relation to the troops in Baghdad, saying, `We'll seek advice from the diplomatic security officer.' We have pleaded with them to seek advice before rushing off at the mouth and making up all these policies as they go along. Get the briefings and understand what all these people in Iraq are actually doing.I was collapsing from exhaustion after all of this. There was a constant change of policy - but then you always have to watch what they are saying. The Leader of the Opposition came out this morning in an interview and said something that I thought was even more remarkable in relation to his policy on Iraq. I am not sure what it is, because it is not clear. I think it is still `Bring everybody back by Christmas,' but I am not sure. It is not a new development for the Labor Party. This has been Labor policy for 12 months. So the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs has been mouthing a completely different policy from the Labor policy of the last 12 months.I was amused to find that on Wednesday, 31 March - that is this Wednesday - there is to be a seminar organised by the Parliamentary Library. Everybody in the House can go. The seminar is called `Iraq, Intervention and the Responsibility to Protect'. Here is the notice of the seminar. And who is to chair this seminar? None other than Mr Kevin Rudd, MP. Presumably it was more than 12 months ago that he agreed to chair this seminar. The policy chaos we are getting from the Labor Party here might be amusing for the parliament, but it is not amusing for the national interest, because this gets to the very heart of the credibility of the Leader of the Opposition and the capacity of somebody in that position to become the Prime Minister of this country and be responsible for the security of this nation. Somebody who makes up five policies on the run during the course of a week is not a person who is worthy of being the Prime Minister of this country.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question and for the interest he shows. My department has been working for some weeks now on the preparation of a white paper on the broader issue of terrorism. This work was well under way, by the way, before the Madrid bombing, but the Madrid bombing has highlighted the need to make sure that we do everything we possibly can to communicate these issues not just to the Australian community but, if I may say so, importantly to the broader international community.The fact of the white paper is an important development. Its purposes will be to present Australia's view - an authoritative view - of the modern terrorist threat and, obviously, to explore the issue of how the government is responding internationally to this terrorist threat. It will examine why the audacity and magnitude of the contemporary terrorist threat presents a fundamental threat to Australia's interests. This is not just something that affects one particular corner of the earth; this is something that affects the whole of the international community. It will explore the nature of the threat and the global dimensions and origins of it.Importantly, it will explore the organisational proficiency, across national boundaries, of terrorist organisations and how and why these terrorist organisations deliberately target innocent people and have a quest for high human toll. It will outline how the threat is manifesting itself in our own region - the Asia-Pacific region - and what we are doing in our region to address that and how the region is working together to address it.The war against terrorism, as the paper will make clear, is a global war and there has to be a global response. You cannot just shrink away into one corner of the earth and hope the problem will disappear. You have to be prepared to face this problem. You have to have the courage to address it and to deal with it and that has to be done on a global scale. We have to work together as an international community to do that and we have to work together as a regional community. The Asia-Pacific ministerial summit - cohosted by Hassan Wirajuda, the Indonesian foreign minister, and me in early February - is a very good illustration of what work is being done in the region to build cooperation on counter-terrorism. The white paper will address all of these issues and look for still further ways that we can enhance that international cooperation.In conclusion to my answer to the honourable member's question, one of the important things about the white paper is that it will be as authoritative a document as you will find in describing what drives the terrorists: what their true motives and true objectives are. It is very important, in terms of public debate not just in this country but around the world, that we have a clear and comprehensive and sophisticated understanding of what the issues at stake really are.</DOC>

 - I remind the member for Lilley that the issue of a single payment was first canvassed by me about 2½ years ago. It was canvassed in the joint paper released by Senator Vanstone, the former Minister for Family and Community Services; and the Minister for Health and Ageing, the then Minister for Workplace Relations, at the end of 2002.The principle here is a very good principle and it is based on a recommendation of the McClure report. Patrick McClure is one of the most respected welfare leaders in this country. There are a couple of principles that underlie it. The first principle is that it is good to get people off welfare and back into work. That is the driving force of all of this. The second principle is that you can actually achieve that by altering some of the incentives in the system. Thirdly, you can do it without cutting anybody's benefit. That is what I undertook to be the case. I repeated that undertaking yesterday. I simply say again to anybody who may be alarmed at this latest little exercise by the member for Lilley: we are not going to cut anybody's benefit. But obviously, if you increase work force participation, you save money because people go off benefits and into the work force.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question. I can inform the House that, when this government abolished wholesale sales tax and replaced it with a goods and services tax, one of the undertakings which we gave was that every single dollar raised by the goods and services tax would go to the various state governments around Australia: in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart and the two territories.On Friday of last week the eight Labor state and territory governments came to Canberra to divide among themselves the GST revenue, which in 2004-05 will amount to some $34 billion. For the sake of the House it is important that we outline what each of the states and governments is now receiving by way of GST revenue. The New South Wales government in the next financial year will receive $9,549 million under the GST revenue-sharing arrangement. Victoria will receive $7,078 million, Queensland will receive $7,098 million, Western Australia will receive $3,494 million, South Australia will receive $3,181 million and Tasmania will receive $1,395 million under the GST-sharing arrangement which was put in place by this government.GST revenue now pays for every schoolteacher in every classroom in every government school in Australia. It now pays the wages of all of the police on the beat in those eight Labor states and territories. Indeed, in this year there will be a bonus of $953 million to the eight Labor states and territories because this government put that arrangement in place.As the GST raises additional revenue, none of it goes to the Commonwealth. All of it is received by the states. I think we pay it on a monthly basis to the eight Labor states and territories. That is 96 monthly payments a year, and this has been in place for about four years. That is about 400 payments we have made of GST revenue, and you know what? Not one state has yet refused to cash its monthly cheque - not on one occasion. The Australian Labor Party, which opposed these arrangements and is now the sole beneficiary in all the states and territories, has not on one occasion refused to cash its cheque. The other thing which I should disclose to the House is that not one of the Labor treasurers asked for the GST to be rolled back. There did not seem to be any interest in that policy at the ministerial council on Friday either.There is one last thing I do want to say, because I think there has been a great deal of misinformation about this: no state in 2004-05 is receiving less money than it received in 2003-04 - including the state of New South Wales, which, when you take into account the GST to which it is entitled, plus the specific purpose payments that it is receiving as a result of other Commonwealth programs, is not worse off. It will be receiving an additional $188 million in 2004-05 - an additional $111 million from GST and the remainder in specific purpose payments.These were the big changes in Commonwealth-state financial relations. They were put in place by the coalition government. The Labor Party opposed them all the way. The Labor Party now try to take the benefit of them. All we ask the Labor Party to do is to be honest about - and to account to the people of Australia for - the benefits under which the states and territories are collectively receiving $34 billion of GST revenue.</DOC>

 - We have absolutely no intention of reducing the generosity of indexation arrangements - none whatsoever. I might remind the member for Lilley, rhetorically of course, that I lead the government that actually indexed pensions to male total average weekly earnings, not average weekly ordinary time earnings. Do you know the difference - do you know the $8 billion difference - between the two of them? I think the member for Lilley does; maybe it is his leader who has difficulty comprehending the difference. We understand the difference; so do the pensioners of Australia. And I want to say to the pensioners and beneficiaries of Australia that we will continue to support them - we will continue the existing indexation arrangements - and we have no intention of taking away the indexation arrangements to sole pensioners either.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and I would like to inform her and the House that at the ministerial council on Friday - with the additional $953 million GST windfall this year, increasing in the next year, 2005-06 - the Commonwealth demanded that each of the Labor states abolish the bank account debits tax from 1 July 2005. I can announce to the House that bank account debits tax will be erased in Australia from 1 July 2005, and that will be funded by the GST arrangements which this government put in place. That will be a tax cut to the people of Australia of around $1.2 billion, so that they will no longer be charged a tax when they take money out of their own bank accounts. This is the kind of tax reform which could not have occurred if this government had not changed Australia's tax system and introduced a new tax system back in July 2000.Having said that, I was extremely disappointed today to see that the New South Wales government, which is receiving an additional $188 million, has now announced that in its next budget it will be increasing taxes on the people of New South Wales. The Carr government is now reeling from a transport crisis: its trains are in chaos and its budget has run off the rails. What it has announced is that it will be introducing new taxes on the people of New South Wales, notwithstanding that this government will be allocating an additional $188 million in 2004-05.This got me thinking about the modus operandi of Labor governments. Was there any mention in last year's state election that Premier Carr would be increasing taxes if he were re-elected? No, there was not. It is a little bit like the Scoresby Freeway - the modus operandi of the Bracks government. You write a letter to everybody telling them, `You're getting a freeway,' and then after the election you toll them every time they use it - some freeway, tolling the people of Victoria on the ladder of opportunity. Because Labor will not tell you the truth before an election, do not listen to what they say; look at what they do. That is what we always say about the Labor Party. I want to disclose to the House one other thing which I think is very important here. At the ministerial meeting last Friday there were eight Labor governments and one coalition government -  - which apparently drives the member for Gellibrand to drink. I would advise her when she drinks not to swallow a contact lens. - Under the intergovernmental agreement between the Commonwealth and the states which this government put in place, all you need to broaden the base of the GST or to raise the rate is unanimous agreement by the eight states and territories and the Commonwealth. If there had been one more Labor government - that is, nine Labor governments - you would have had a unanimous majority of nine at that council and, for the first and only time in Australian history, with coast-to-coast Labor governments, the Labor Party would have had the opportunity to increase the rate of the GST. There was nobody at that ministerial finance council who asked for tax reductions, except for me on behalf of the Commonwealth. There were eight Labor states and territories who asked for additional spending and have now gone home to introduce increased taxes.This is what gave meaning to another one of those airbrushed transcripts that the member for Werriwa has from occasion to occasion. This one was with Neil Mitchell on 19 March 2004. He was singing, with Neil Mitchell, of the joys that there would be in Australia if there were unanimous Labor governments throughout the country. He said, `There's areas where federal and state can work together better and I think that cooperation is the way to go. I mean, one of the things you'd have to do is totally rearrange federal/state financial arrangements - open up the GST arrangement.' That is what he said on 19 March 2004. Little did we know what he had in mind. But to the people of Australia I would say this: if you were to have those coast-to-coast Labor governments, including the Commonwealth, you would be able to open up the GST arrangement. It could be a unanimous agreement, the rate and the base could change. There was only one government interested in cutting taxes at the ministerial council on Friday. It was this government which got the commitment on the bank account debits tax. The Labor governments went home to increase taxes. Labor stands for higher taxes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The latest figures on our waterfront performance are very impressive indeed. The Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics will shortly release the latest edition of Waterline, now in its 10th year. It shows that over the six months from July to December last year we actually managed in this country record total cargo volumes - never before achieved - of 54.3 million tonnes, a truly astonishing level for a country and economy the size of Australia. At the same time, a record number of containers were moved: in 20-foot equivalent units, 2.114 million. Here is another amazing statistic: an astonishing 13 quarters in a row now has seen us exceed the target we set ourselves of 25 container movements an hour - 13 consecutive quarters! - and during the December quarter of last year we managed 27.2. That is, I think, quite a remarkable performance, and all the more so when you think of the importance of exports to the Australian economy, with one in five jobs nationally being dependent on exports - and one in four in regional areas of Australia. That, of course, underlines the importance of us having efficient ports. A working waterfront, it needs to be recalled - and I think this is often forgotten, including, I have to say, regrettably, by some of the government's own supporters - was seen as the litmus test of the government's commitment to industrial relations reform and its effectiveness when we came to government eight years ago. We passed with flying colours. It is as simple as that.In contrast, I am asked about impediments. Waterfront reform is an ongoing necessity in Australia. We have to compete with others around the world who are continually lifting their game. The impediment is easily found when you go back to the Labor Party's response when we announced our target of 25 movements an hour. They said it could not be achieved in the Australian context. That is what they said. They had gone to sleep, with an average container movement in this country across our major ports of around 16 an hour, and they said - because the MUA said it - that it was impossible to go beyond that in the Australian context. What is the threat? It is very simple: the Labor Party, if ever elected to office, have made it quite plain that responsibility for the waterfront would go back to the MUA. That would be a great win for the MUA and the handful of members that it has - but at very great cost to the Australian economy and to the jobs that depend on an efficient waterfront.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Perth for his question and for the opportunity to inform the House that funding in aged care has reached a record level under this government. When we came to government, funding across the aged care sector was some $3 billion. In just seven years that figure has increased by 100 per cent. Today, in the current 2003-04 budget, $6 billion is allocated to aged care - some $4.5 billion of that sum in the form of residential aged care subsidies and grants.The Salvation Army announced that it planned to sell off, by competitive tender, a number of its aged care centres as continuing services. It was not proposing to close any homes; it was a planned sale as a result of the army's decision to refocus its mission to the financially and socially disadvantaged people in the community. To suggest, as the member does, that the decision was based on a funding crisis of some sort flies in the face of the Salvation Army's own statements. In fact, on 1 March this year, Major Colin Haggar of the Salvation Army of the eastern territories indicated - in fact, stated publicly - that the Salvation Army would be spending `quite a number of millions of dollars to bring all our aged care facilities in New South Wales and Queensland up to state of the art'. There is clearly confidence in the sector expressed by the Salvation Army in its desire to expend `quite a number of millions of dollars' to bring the facilities up to state of the art.There is confidence in the sector. An estimated $821 million worth of new building refurbishment extensions was completed by the end of the financial year 2003. A further $940 million worth of new work was in progress as at the end of June 2003. This government has also commissioned Professor Warren Hogan to consider the underlying cost pressures and the operating and capital requirements of the aged care sector. After a very thorough analysis of the industry, Professor Hogan has presented his recommendations to the government and they will be considered in the context of the 2004 budget.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question and inform him that last week I announced in the House that, a year after the Cole royal commission had tabled its report, the government is determined to do everything within its power to fix the lawlessness in the building and construction industry which Commissioner Cole had found. Indeed, I tabled a report by the interim building industry task force which indicated quite clearly that the culture of thuggery, intimidation and illegal activity is still rife within the building and construction industry - something which we are determined to stop. The report met with considerable acclaim by building industry bodies. The Western Australian Master Builders Association said, `The tabling today in federal parliament of the building industry task force report is damning confirmation that the culture of industrial relations lawlessness is still alive and well in the industry.' It is for that reason that I announced the establishment of the building industry task force as a permanent body. It has undertaken, and is currently undertaking, some 15 matters before the courts in Australia. That is in addition to some 31 actions which are still with the state and territory governments around Australia, arising from Commissioner Cole's confidential report. Examples of the lawlessness in the activities in the building construction industry are set out in a series of case studies in this report. For example, there is a case study of a subcontractor who, in order to be able to continue to work on a building site, was forced to pay $7,000 for seven CFMEU t-shirts - that is $1,000 per t-shirt - simply for a subcontractor to continue to work on a building site in Australia. There are other examples in the building industry task force report.I am asked about impediments to reform by the member for Hinkler. The greatest impediment, of course, is the Labor union bosses - the financial controllers of the Australian Labor Party - who are implacably opposed to any reform. Western Australian militant union boss Kevin Reynolds said on Friday, `The creation of a permanent building enforcement body for the building industry won't change the way the union operates.' This is one of the most militant unions in Australia. In fact, the CFMEU statement of principles on their web site says that the CFMEU will respect Australian law unless they don't agree with it. The law is clear cut. It ought to be respected by all.The Leader of the Opposition has to make a decision. He has to make a choice: whether he is going to simply follow the money trail from the union bosses or whether he is going to stand up for jobs and stand up for cleaning up this industry in Australia. Just a couple of weeks ago we had further examples of the attitude of this union. A report in the Herald Sun in Melbourne on Saturday, 13 March, said that 15 left-wing unions, including the militant Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union and the Electrical Trades Union, had walked out of a vote in the Trades Hall Council and that vote was to denounce violence and thuggery in industrial relations in Victoria. So here you have the CFMEU and the ETU walking out of a vote, and the vote was there to denounce thuggery and violence in the unions and the workplaces of Australia - in particular of Melbourne and Victoria.It is no wonder that the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party will not stand up to this. The CFMEU alone donated $316,926 to the ALP last year, and since 1994-95 the CFMEU has donated over $3.6 million to the Australian Labor Party. There is a choice for the Leader of the Opposition: either support the government's reforms in this regard or continue to have in place the violence, thuggery and intimidation that goes on in the building and construction industry, with the resultant loss of jobs for Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. The answers are yes, no and no. But the most important thing to do, as always, is to focus on the facts. -  - As always, it is important to focus on the facts. As the Hansard clearly says:It is very interesting to see the way the Labor Party is approaching the issues of training in Australia and in particular the pricing of them. For example, the Labor Party is railing against the possibility that university graduates, when they have finished university, might have to pay up to 25 per cent more back through the tax system for their university education -  - It continues:to which the taxpayer has contributed three-quarters of the cost, and not pay a cent back until they are earning $36,000 a year. And yet there is not a word being said about changes to TAFE fees. For TAFE, students have to pay at the gate. They cannot get into TAFE until they have paid their TAFE fees and paid them up front. More than a quarter of the students who attend TAFE throughout Australia come from the poorest socioeconomic status suburbs in the country.So a family in Green Valley writes to the Leader of the Opposition - and has two children. The first wants to do economics at Sydney University and the family is concerned about the possibility that the student might pay back $20,000 through the tax system once they have had their university education and in the first year will earn at least $37,000 - and the Leader of the Opposition says, `Get the member for Jagajaga out there. We have to campaign against this. There's no way we want people training to be lawyers and doctors and economists paying any more for their education whilst the taxpayer is paying for three-quarters of it.' For the brother of the student from Green Valley though who wants to go to the South West Institute of TAFE to do electrical engineering, a 188 per cent increase in fees that have to be paid up-front with a family credit card and an interest rate of 16 per cent - and what does the Leader of the Opposition do? Not a word. He says, `Go and see the member for Macarthur if you want something done about that.' The situation is so desperate for these families - Clearly the point here is that the Labor Party have absolutely no interest whatsoever in some of the poorest families in the country who have to pay their TAFE fees up front. There is a 300 per cent increase in TAFE fees imposed by their Labor cousins in New South Wales - and not a word is said by the Labor Party about that. There is a 25 per cent increase in TAFE fees in the state of Victoria, thanks to the Bracks government, just before they announced a toll on the Scoresby Freeway - and not a word about that or about a 50 per cent increase in TAFE fees in South Australia. The Labor Party say they are driving a social justice truck, but they most certainly - the Leader of the Opposition in particular - could be accused of being hypocritical.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Perth for his question. This is typical of the very shallow and irresponsible approach that Labor have taken in relation to aged care, because all they are doing is responding to media speculation. Labor clearly have no ideas of their own. They are clearly still paralysed in terms of policy making in aged care. Ten years on from the damning Professor Gregory report - an indictment on Labor - they still do not have any ideas in aged care. Even now they do not know if they are coming or going. Apparently today in a press release the member for Perth said, `Mark Latham recently made it clear that Labor will not be supporting the extension of bonds to high-level care.' That is apparently news to other Labor members. It has been reported that Senator Michael Forshaw gave a keynote address on behalf of the ALP in Cairns recently and he said he would not rule bonds in or out. So what is it? What is Labor's policy on aged care?This gives me an opportunity to remind members of the House that, under the Howard government, there have been record levels of aged care funding, from $3 billion in 1996 to $6 billion today. There have been a record number of places allocated in aged care - some 55,600 new aged care places. As I have said on a number of occasions, we received the Hogan recommendations just on a month ago. The recommendations are being considered by government in the context of the 2004 budget.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. I know how committed she is to the government's Tough on Drugs policy. It certainly is not easy to win the war on drugs, but win it we must, because there is no safe way to inject illicit drugs; there is no safe way to manage a heroin habit. I am pleased to say that the government's Tough on Drugs policy seems to be working. We have had a 23 per cent reduction in the number of people using illicit drugs since 1998; we have had a 60 per cent reduction in the number of heroin users; and, most importantly, deaths from drug overdoses have fallen from over 1,100 to under 400 - thanks, at least in part, to the government's Tough on Drugs policy.  - Unfortunately, as the interjection indicates, not everyone supports those policies. The Leader of the Opposition, for instance, said just last month, `Labor has said consistently that we will support trials' - that is, injecting room trials and heroin trials. Then the member for Grayndler, a frontbench member of the opposition, said:... it is not the heroin per se that causes all these problems, it is often the criminalisation of the supply and use of heroinSo the member for Grayndler is not even sure that heroin should be illegal. The member for Gellibrand, the shadow Attorney-General, said:We cannot simply say that our preference is for there to be zero drug use.What is her preference? How much drug use is acceptable to the member for Gellibrand? I just say to members opposite that they should heed the advice of an extremely distinguished expert on fighting drug addiction - none other than the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mr Mick Keelty, who was described in this House in the MPI last Thursday as `a great Australian'. Let me quote Mick Keelty on heroin trials, on injecting rooms. He said:All these options take us along a path of saying that using drugs like heroin is okay, and where do we stop with a trial? Do we extend this to other drugs, such as cocaine which is now injected in many of our cities?...	...	...By opening up heroin trials this simply feeds the addiction rather than dealing with the problem, so it treats the symptom and not the cause.He went on to say:Both heroin trials and injecting clinics reinforce an ambiguity about the situation that shouldn't be there. How can we produce a drug-free generation and at the same time sanction the use of illicit drugs for a portion of the community?On this matter, Mick Keelty is absolutely right. Many members of the opposition do need to rethink their position, and I respectfully call on the Leader of the Opposition to have another think about this and to move his party to a position where it is no longer soft on drug abuse.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Perth for his question and his sudden interest in the issue of aged care. It would be very interesting to ascertain how many spot checks were undertaken when Labor was in government and in charge of aged care. Under Labor, there was no accreditation system that set national legislated benchmarks for care. This government introduced an accreditation system. For the first time, we had an accreditation system that was a quality assurance system across all 3,000 aged care facilities funded by the federal government. This accreditation system is a framework of quality assessment and quality assurance and includes a complaints resolution scheme, a commissioner for complaints, and a series of reviews, audits and spot checks.I appreciate that the member for Perth spends his nights trawling through the accreditation agency's web site trying to find on the public record instances of poor care or instances that might have escaped the immediate attention of the accreditation agency. Let me remind the member for Perth that the accreditation agency's web site is all about improving the quality of care. Perhaps improving quality is something that the Labor Party could learn about. - The agency does not airbrush off its web site what it does not wish to be made public. - It does not delete off its web site facts it might find unpalatable. We find that a quality assurance program introduced by this government is in fact widely regarded by the sector as the best thing that has happened in aged care. Under Labor, there was no national legislated scheme. This scheme is working. What is Labor's alternative? Is Labor proposing to axe this consumer protection for residents? What is Labor's policy?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. In response to him, I note that the Australian Labor Party platform will give union bosses access to businesses throughout Australia, even when there are no union members of those businesses. This is a platform that will give union bosses a foot in the door and an eye on the books of every business in Australia, even without union members being present. We know that this is binding on the Australian Labor Party because the Leader of the Opposition has told us that the federal platform is binding on every member of the Australian Labor Party.I noted recently that the national secretary of the Maritime Union of Australia, Paddy Crumlin, was quoted as saying that the union `needs to be political in order to be industrial'. We saw the antics of the MUA in the past, which almost turned one of the largest and most strategic industries in Australia into a small business. The Labor Party's platform would do that for every industry in Australia. This is a platform which is indeed a political one - a platform written by the big union bosses for the big union bosses and, of course, paid for by the $40 million worth of donations from the unions to the Australian Labor Party. This comes at a time when just 17 per cent of workers in the private sector in Australia are members of a union. The Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Greg Combet, also speaking at the MUA conference recently, noted that the voting profile of union members was not much different from that of the general population - about 40 per cent voting Labor. He went on to say that this was a far cry from the overwhelming support Labor had enjoyed in previous generations. Of course, he is right. What we have here is a platform which is written by narrow sectional interests with political agendas. The union bosses will be given rights over ordinary workers in Australia, and the union bosses will be given rights over businesses both great and small.This is not just hollow rhetoric coming from the government, because what we have seen in Western Australia is precisely this platform having been enacted by the Labor Gallop government. In South Australia, the Rann Labor government wants to enact the same platform. In Western Australia, the right of entry can be exercised by not only an authorised person but also a union official. So you can be the small mum and dad business operating from home with no union employees with the prospect of somebody coming and knocking on the door and saying, `I am representing the union. I want to enter your business. I want to look at the books.' That is what the Labor Party is proposing for business in Australia. No wonder the Financial Review editorial today commented:Business is rightly worried that Labor's electoral prospects are rising at a time when it is becoming increasingly beholden to its union paymasters - which have donated $40 million to the party since 1996 ...Business is right to be worried. In the words of the small business organisation in Western Australia, business is afraid - very afraid - of the Labor Party. These are plans written by union bosses for union bosses. They will give unionists the right of entry into every business in Australia. This is just further proof that Labor is bad for business, bad for workers, bad for jobs and would be bad for Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce. I recognise that, like so many other members of the Liberal and National parties, the member for Pearce has worked in small business. She has real experience in small business, unlike the Leader of the Opposition who has never worked in business, I understand -  - or the shadow minister for small business who has never worked in business, let alone small business. Last Friday the Australian Industrial Relations Commission ruled that all small businesses under federal awards were now liable to pay redundancy to retrenched workers. This is a blow for Australia's 1.1 million small businesses. Since 1984, employers with fewer than 15 employees had previously been exempt. But until Friday's decision, a small business needing to make redundant a minimum wage employee of four years service was required to provide about $1,340 to that employee. After the decision on Friday, that has gone up to nearly $5,000. If it is a qualified tradesperson, they will receive over $8,200 in severance pay, and that is about $6,000 more than prior to Friday's decision. So it is a significant increase and a significant cost burden on more than half a million small businesses that are employing other Australians. Why has this come about? This has come about because the industrial wing of the Labor Party put a submission to the Industrial Relations Commission supporting this initiative which is going to have a profound impact on small business. I am never quite sure who is driving the policy. Is it the Labor Party, the political wing of the industrial movement, or is it the industrial movement, the political wing of the Labor Party? - They may well be one and the same. It is like a Hydra, isn't it? You have got your property wing at Centenary House. You have got your industrial wing in the ACTU. You have got your human resources wing, `Nepotism Inc.'. You have got a range of different subsidiaries. It is not a partnership; it is the union movement driving Labor Party policy. What is the impact of that? Let us have a look at the Labor Party's policies now. Ask yourself how it is going to affect small business to have a policy from the Labor Party that is going to push casual employees into permanent part-time employment. It means that employers are going to have to look at a range of different entitlements for their employees, such as sick leave and long service leave, and, of course, it means a pay cut for the casual workers. We know that the Labor Party wants to introduce a national payroll tax to pay for its employee entitlements legislation - another disincentive for small business to employ more people, and more red tape for small business.The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations talked about the right of entry and the fact that the union movement and their mates can now have unqualified access to every small business in the country, even if they have not got union members working there, in order to interview them. Under the Labor Party's industrial relations policy, every employer has to give to an employee coming back from maternity leave an entitlement to part-time work rather than full-time work. The Labor Party does not understand the implications that has in regional and remote Australia. For example, in a small accounting firm or a small workshop with two skilled employees, if one goes off on maternity leave, what is the employer going to do if they have to offer that person part-time work instead of full-time work when they come back?It is quite clear where the Labor Party is heading. The Labor Party is heading in the direction of closing down small business employment - that is, employment that represents three million jobs in Australia. It is the engine room of the Australian economy, and the Labor Party, through its workplace relations policies, is unapologetically closing down small business employment. This is another example of the Labor Party and the unions working in a partnership. But it is not a partnership. It has a real impact on jobs, it has a real impact on the economy and it has a huge impact on small business.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dickson for his question. I can assure him, as I indicated to the House yesterday and as I will be explaining in more detail later today, that the government's position about the maintenance of our presence in and around Iraq has not altered. Whilst, quite correctly, the commander of the Australian contingent in and around Iraq indicated that he is not going to buy into the political debate in this country, he made some pertinent observations this morning about the contribution that our forces were making to the rehabilitation of Iraq and the building of a new future for the people of Iraq. I am asked whether there are any alternative positions. There is an alternative position or, dare I say it, if you include the member for Lyons on the doors this morning, you have six alternative positions from the Australian Labor Party, because the member for Lyons has now embraced what you might call the `blue helmet' alternative as number 6.I think everyone would have been riveted by Lateline last night. Lateline is often compulsory viewing when this place is in session and particularly when you are trying to get a few views from the Australian Labor Party about their policy. Last night the member for Griffith was interviewed, and he was asked this very explicit question:Can you confirm the 'troops home by Christmas' was a policy endorsed by the Shadow Cabinet 12 months ago?Remember that the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday that shadow cabinet had decided on Labor's policy 12 months ago. A lot of us on this side of the House find that very hard to believe - and, if you watched the demeanour of the member for Griffith, you would think that he found it pretty hard to believe as well. This is what he had to say in reply: `I can't recall every shadow cabinet meeting we've had.' Jones, the interviewer, said:I don't want to harp on this, but apparently you don't recall a Shadow Cabinet decision 12 months ago that troops should be home by Christmas?Rudd:Well Tony, we've had many, many meetings on this subject and I'm very careful about not misleading you about what was said when.And I think one could add `and what was not said when either'. The reality is that every utterance of the member for Griffith over the last 12 months has been totally at odds with the claim made by the Leader of the Opposition that the policy was made 12 months ago.But we are assured by the Leader of the Opposition that he is a person who in public life always tells the truth. I can only throw myself on the mercy of the House and express my very, very deep reservations about whether that meeting took place. I cannot prove whether or not it took place. The Leader of the Opposition could do so by throwing out the minutes and letting us know. What I can do, though -  - Freedom of information does not apply to oppositions. But what I can do is read the transcripts of news conferences produced by the Leader of the Opposition. Frequently - and as recently as this morning - the Leader of the Opposition keeps asserting that he has had discussions with officials from Foreign Affairs and Defence about the situation in Iraq. He went on this morning to say not only that but also:And I've got to say I've been sitting there shaking my head wondering what Mr Downer is going on about because he obviously doesn't know what happens inside his own department.That is what he said this morning. But that does not tally with the advice that we have received. I have in my hand a letter dated today, written by the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, which reads as follows:This is to confirm that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has no record of having provided a briefing on Iraq to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Mark Latham.The department had no record of having provided a briefing. The letter does, though, go on to say - listen to this; it gives you an idea of priorities:We understand that one of Mr Latham's advisers attended a briefing provided to the office of Mr Kevin Rudd on the proposed tribunal to try Saddam Hussein.In other words, `We want to know Saddam gets a fair trial but we're not too worried about finding out what is going on inside Iraq'.This letter must be a fake, because the Leader of the Opposition has told us that he would never mislead the Australian public, that he would always be completely truthful in public life. All I can say is that I cannot prove that that meeting did not take place a year ago but I have to confess to those in this House, particularly those who sit opposite, that I have really got serious doubts as to whether that meeting ever took place. The member for Griffith claimed that he has a lot of serious doubts about it. I do know that the evidence so far available to me and to the House is the claim made by the Leader of the Opposition that he has not only had one briefing but that he has had frequent briefings and he has been so involved in those briefings that he has been shaking his head; yet the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Murray McLean, writes today:This is to confirm that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has no record of having provided a briefing on Iraq to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Mark Latham.Somebody is wrong. It cannot be the Leader of the Opposition - can it? -  - No, it cannot possibly be the Leader of the Opposition. He would not do that, would he? Mr Speaker, I table the letter.</DOC>

 - No, I do not. The tax office has an obligation to administer the law as passed by this parliament and a tax practitioner has an obligation to abide by the law as passed by this parliament. To say that there is some fundamental conflict of interest is complete rubbish - too clever by half, if I may say so. It has taken a long time to think up a question, but I would advise that further work be done by the member for Kingston in relation to the matter. In administering those laws, my view is that taxpayers have an obligation to comply and the tax office has an obligation to comply. Why do I say that? One of the principles of our society is the rule of law - that is, be you ever so high, the law is above you. That means that the law is above both the tax office and the taxpayer and both are obliged to observe it.We are releasing a discussion paper. The way in which this will be done is that we will be getting feedback in relation to that discussion paper and we will be looking at ways of, if possible, improving the tax system. One of the things that we are looking at is that there may be shorter periods in relation to the ability to go back. There may be other changes in relation to record keeping. But I think it would be wrong of us to rule out any improvements to the administration of the taxation laws. I think this is actually a good initiative. In fact, I do not know why the Australian Labor Party is not supporting us in this initiative, because I thought - and I might be wrong about this - that your leader said that when the government did good things the Australian Labor Party was going to be positive and it was going to get up and support it. I thought that is what he said. But I am yet to hear a statement from any of the so-called economic spokesmen of the Australian Labor Party endorsing the things that this government does. And here we are, we are an economy which has been growing - you said it would be in recession -  - The member for Kingston and the member for Hotham said it would be in recession if we reformed the Australian taxation system. Here we are, we have survived a downturn in the United States; here we are, we have historically low interest rates; here we are, we have an unemployment rate which is the lowest in 22 years - and I am still waiting for a positive expression from any of the so-called economic spokesmen of the Labor Party. You see, it is a dual track strategy. We have figured this out. For public consumption purposes, the Leader of the Opposition says he is going to be positive. But, in reality, each one of those spokesmen is sent around with their same old negativity, whining and whinging that they have been going on with for years. It is what is called the difference between a broadcast and a narrowcast. The old member for Werriwa is on the narrowcast, but the member for Kingston and the member for Hotham are on the broadcast. Let me leave the House with one imponderable question: have you ever heard anything positive ever said by the member for Hotham?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for his question and note his very real interest in this, particularly in view of his role in the past as a minister for veterans' affairs and defence personnel. The ADF is plainly playing key roles in advancing Australia's and Iraq's national interests - and, I would think, the interests of peace loving people everywhere - through its involvement in Iraq at the moment. For example, the security detail is enabling the Australian Representative Office to perform vital representative work of a commercial and political nature in the Coalition Provisional Authority and, indeed, among new Iraqi leaders. The ADF is providing vital support for coalition and Iraqi efforts to stabilise Iraq against terror threats - and think of the very important work that is being carried out by our air traffic control operators over there, for example, and also through the training for the new Iraqi army.I think the broader point should also be made that they are making a very valuable contribution to the broader war against terrorism in the Middle East through the activities of the HMASMelbourne, the P3 Orions and the various staff in the region. Iraqi leadership is overwhelmingly positive about Australia's role. They tell us and our representatives that they appreciate what we are doing. They offer their thanks. They say, `We still need you.' They also say that they will not forget what we are doing for them. Quite frankly, to pull out straight after Madrid, with the job not done, is nothing less than a slap in the face for the Iraqi people. It also sends a message to terrorists that we can be intimidated and that we will change course if they behave in certain ways.I am asked about alternative views. I have to say that it is well known that the Leader of the Opposition's policy is in total confusion since the Madrid bombing. His rationale given on the Today show on the 25th of this month was:... we are going to be much safer as a nation if we have our troops here instead of on the other side of the world.I think we have understood for the last 100-plus years that very often our security at home can be well and truly advanced by our being active in other theatres, often at opposite corners of the globe. But at the very least, in terms of what is happening in the world today, he fails to understand in these remarks how Australia's ADF presence overseas in Iraq, East Timor and the Solomon Islands is vital to Australia's national security. These matters of national security are, quite frankly, far too important for policy on the run. The Leader of the Opposition shows inexperience, weakness and a poor understanding of Australia's interests and society. I note with some interest that the Leader of the Opposition has a flyer that has been distributed in quite a few electorates. It says:Mark Latham: A New Style of Leader. I am quoting:It's a shame, but some politicians seem reluctant to talk to real people, but I want to hear your views, not from advisers or pollsters - or shadow cabinets - but straight from you.The Leader of the Opposition says he will not be poll driven - and in this case he probably was not, because if he had been poll driven, if he had gone out there before the event, he would have established that the Australian people feel the job should be finished. However, very interestingly - and I am indebted to a Nationals staffer who was in Sydney last weekend and was quick enough to realise he was being polled - it appears that the Labor Party went out after this decision to establish, by polling, what the Australian people thought about it, to clean up after the mess. Anyway, our staffer was quick enough, when he was rung on the weekend by ANOP, to grab a pen and paper and take down the questions as they were asked. There are about three pages of them. It was very long. They had all the routine questions about how you vote and what you think of the various leaders around the place, but then Labor's pollsters got to the real topic that they wanted to test, and our staffer was asked if he agreed or disagreed with the following statements. Firstly:The Australian troops in Iraq should be withdrawn before Christmas.Secondly:If the Australian troops are withdrawn from Iraq it will damage the ANZUS alliance.Thirdly:The troops are needed more at home to protect Australia than they are in Iraq.Fourthly:We should leave troops in Iraq for an extended period if the United States asks us.But then we got to key question - the question they really wanted an answer to:Does Mark Latham's stance on the troops in Iraq make you more or less likely to vote for the ALP?You should not make policy like this on the run; you ought to make policy like this in the national interest.</DOC>

 - I say in reply to the member for Throsby that I am not aware of the particular details but I accept her word that that is a fair extrapolation based on some overall figures. I simply remind her of what I have said in the past in relation to this issue: you are talking here about a situation where people are merely being invited to pay back something that, in accordance with the rules governing the receipt of the benefit, they are not entitled to have; they represent overpayments. We have introduced top-up payments and we have made a number of changes in relation to the payment of these benefits over the past couple of years. As I have indicated on previous occasions, further enhancements are things that remain under constant review.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie and I acknowledge the contribution that he makes to economic debate in this parliament, as a one-time economics teacher and as somebody who follows the debate very closely. Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the international trade in goods and services figures for the month of February. They showed a $154 million improvement on the January figures, with a balance in deficit of $1.716 billion. That was an improvement of around $742 million on the December figures.There was a substantial fall in imports, driven by an 11 per cent fall in the import of consumption goods, and there was a fall in exports, although of a lower dimension. The export of travel services rose strongly in the month of February, no doubt the result of good tourism policy here in Australia, and rural exports were quite reasonable - certainly higher than they have been over the course of the last year. But in relation to other areas, including minerals, exports were down. What that probably shows is that demand is slowing in the Australian economy. Imports of consumption goods were down. There was also a reduction in imports of capital goods, but they vary enormously with the importation of civil aircraft.The Australian Bureau of Statistics today also released building approvals figures. Dwelling approvals rose 3.2 per cent, but that was determined largely by the fact that in one state in particular, New South Wales, medium-density approvals went through in the month, and the medium-density increases in approvals were consequently up 16.9 per cent. That is a notoriously volatile series. What the figures do show is that private sector house approvals fell by 3.1 per cent, which is the fifth consecutive monthly fall, and approvals are now 11.3 per cent lower than they were in September 2003. That confirms a slowing in the Australian housing market, which I have been commenting on for some time. The government are not concerned by slowing in the housing market. It is our view that the housing market has grown very strongly for a period of time. If the housing market were to plateau in terms of prices, that would be in the longer term interests of the Australian economy.I will finish with this observation: in terms of economic management, it has been a difficult period over the last five years. We have had a US recession, the worst drought in Australian history, the outbreak of SARS, September 11 and a war in Iraq. Most countries of the developed world have been in recession, and Australia almost alone has been able to weather those difficulties. But I want to underline again that economic management in difficult periods is very important - there is no room for error. It takes dedicated commitment of purpose. Economic management is not done by having air-bubble thoughts, putting them up and then airbrushing them away as we move on to the next issue. It is not done by taking the latest fad from a computer download. Economic policy requires constant, determined purpose to make sure that the future of Australians, which depends on strong economic management, is looked after. That has been the hallmark of this government - discipline and commitment in relation to economic management - and it will continue to be the hallmark of this government.</DOC>

 - I can say yes, no and yes to the member for Fairfax. I am very pleased to have this question from him, because he understands how hard it is for most members of parliament to raise money for their election campaigns. But the Leader of the Opposition has a truly magical ability to raise $6,721 every single day for his re-election campaign before he has scoffed a single scone or drawn a single raffle at one of those functions that the rest of us have to go to. The Leader of the Opposition has raised nearly $35,000 for Labor's election campaign since question time in this House last Thursday. In less than a week, he has raised that much money, thanks to the Centenary House rent rort.We have just seen, in the Sydney City Council election, a complete wipe-out of the Australian Labor Party because of a transparent head office rort to harvest developer donations. In 60 per cent Labor areas, there was 80 per cent opposition to the ALP because voters wanted to protest against blatant political greed. And, just like the Sydney City Council scam, the Centenary House rent rort is a naked exercise in political greed. It is a blatant get-rich-quick scheme for a political party.Thanks to the rent rort, taxpayers are paying the Australian Labor Party $871 a metre for nondescript office space in Barton. If the Australian National Audit Office were allowed to migrate across the road to the National Press Club, they would be paying just $300 a square metre and, what is more, they would probably be getting a month's free rent for every year. But the Labor Party will not let them. The Labor Party will not let the Audit Office and Australian taxpayers take advantage of the cheap rents that are available in Barton.Mr Speaker, just to give you some idea of the scale of the rip-off, I have been talking to experts about rental prices, and I am told that the most expensive office space in the United States is in the Manhattan Tower in mid-town New York. I looked up some information about the Manhattan Tower on the Internet. It offers amazing views to the east, north and south of New York. It offers fully trained and certified security personnel, it is right next door to the exclusive Four Seasons restaurant, and - as a further inducement to tenants - Manhattan Tower offers discount tickets to all of its tenants for plays, comedy shows and sporting events. At Centenary House they would not even give you a ticket to question time without a further donation to the Labor Party, yet you get all this at Manhattan Tower for just $773. You can rent space on the 23rd floor of Manhattan Tower for $773, which is well under the $871 which the Labor Party is getting from the poor, fleeced Australian taxpayer. Barton costs more than Manhattan, when the Labor Party is the beneficiary.Centenary House is an obscene monument to political greed. It is the Mount Rushmore of rip-offs, and it has the Leader of the Opposition's face engraved on the facade. He says he supports higher ethical standards. That is what he says, but he practises the worst form of Tammany-Hall politics. If he were at all serious about standards, he would end the rent rort rip-off now.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for the question. I can inform the House that the government has had under active consideration for some weeks a proposal for the appointment of somebody at two-star level to the operations staff in the multinational force coalition headquarters in Iraq. I am pleased to inform the House that the Minister for Defence will be indicating this afternoon that Major General Jim Molan will be appointed to the operations staff in those headquarters. He will become the most senior Australian officer in Iraq. The position will be responsible for planning such missions as finding and destroying terrorist cells, patrolling areas where surface-to-air missiles may be fired and, in general, protecting the Iraqi people and the coalition community.The appointment of General Molan as deputy chief of staff for operations demonstrates a number of things - first and foremost, the enormously high regard in which Australian Defence Force personnel are held in Iraq. That is a well-deserved situation. It also demonstrates the government's continued determination to be an active partner with the new Iraq. It is in earnest of our continuing intention as a government and as a nation to see through our responsibilities in Iraq. It is a reminder that it is not the policy of this government to withdraw from commitments until the job is done. It is a reinforcement of the fact that at this time in particular it is important that nations who are together working to build a new Iraq remain totally united and do not give any comfort or solace to those who would want otherwise.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is yes. The answer to the second part of the question is that there are many things that bear upon the relationship between work and family. High interest rates cause an enormous amount of pressure. I find as I go around the Australian community that the greatest fear that is expressed to me by families is that we might go back to 17 per cent interest rates or that mum or dad might lose their job. There is one thing I can say: it will always be a feature of this government, no matter what term you want to pick, that we will be the party more than any other that can deliver low interest rates and high employment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question. I think all members of the House remain deeply concerned about the continued violence in the Middle East and the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian dispute. I do want to draw particular attention to an important address delivered to the Palestinian parliament yesterday by the Palestinian Prime Minister, Ahmed Qurie. In his address the Prime Minister specifically - and, I think, very significantly - denounced suicide bombing as `morally wrong' and an `obstacle to peace'.Can I on behalf of the government welcome this unequivocal renunciation of suicide bombing. The suicide bombing of innocent Israeli citizens has been a sordid feature of the conflict in the Middle East, and the House of course will recall that the former Iraqi dictator was in the habit of paying $25,000 a year to each and every family that sent a suicide bomber to Israel. The Palestinian Prime Minister has warned Palestinians not to carry out suicide attacks in response to the killing of Sheikh Yassin on 22 March. I welcome this very clear statement.We all remain hopeful, despite the dreadful events of recent weeks, that there can be a peaceful resolution between the Israelis and the Palestinians. The government continue to support the so-called road map - which is backed by the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia - and that plan calls for steps by both sides aimed at ending the conflict and establishing an independent Palestinian state by 2005. I take this opportunity to remind the House that, side by side with our longstanding and unflinching support for the state of Israel, this government remain committed to the aspirations of the Palestinian people and there will need to be contributions from both sides if a peaceful resolution is finally to be reached. But an essential element of those contributions has to be an end to the suicide bombings which have claimed the lives of so many Israelis.The sickening spectre of a young boy being used as part of this murderous process has sent a shiver around the world in recent weeks. We continue to urge both sides of the dispute to negotiate in good faith and to build on any recent indications that progress might be achieved. It is in that context that I warmly welcome the admonition delivered by the Palestinian Prime Minister to his parliament. I compliment him on the leadership he has shown on this issue and I hope the Palestinian people take heed of his warning. </DOC>

 - It is the case that there are eligibility criteria attached to the existing baby bonus. As to precisely the impact of that, I would have to get concise advice; I do not carry that around in my head. - I will have a lengthy discussion about it and get a little bit of advice. But I take this opportunity to remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition of the enormous range of family benefits that have been introduced by this government. The reality is that for many families, say, with two children - one child under five - if you look at the tax value of the family tax benefit, you have got a situation where many of those families are effectively free of tax until they are earning about $30,000 a year. The measure of the benefits that have been introduced by this government far exceeds any that existed when we came to power in 1996.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question because it raises a very important public interest matter, one where I think it is important to reassure people over the way in which this issue is being dealt with and to give the House some advice as to some of the steps the government has taken. But I can confirm in relation to the member for Pearce's question that British police believe they may have thwarted a significant terrorist plot in London. They seized half a tonne of ammonium nitrate fertiliser, which is known to be a product that can be used for making bombs. Eight men have been arrested in connection with the seizure, and that of course is pleasing in terms of their intelligence and investigation.This chemical has a widespread use in the mining industry as an explosive, and it is important to the agricultural sector as a source of nitrogen. The government of course are very concerned about the availability of a number of hazardous materials but particularly ammonium nitrate. It is quite obvious that this is not a matter of concern to members of the opposition. We have pursued the matter with the states and territories through the COAG process because the regulation of explosives is in fact in the hands of the states and territories, and we need a national approach to this matter.A set of proposed measures have been developed, and the secretary of the Prime Minister's department has conveyed these to his state and territory counterparts. The government ask that state and territory governments give the proposals their urgent and positive attention. We aim to be in a position by next week to seek a formal response to these proposals. In seeking to strike the right balance between the risks and legitimate use of this product, we will not be seeking an immediate ban on its use either as an explosive in mining and quarrying or as a fertiliser. It is clear that regulations are required to reduce the potential for the misuse of ammonium nitrate. Criteria for granting access to ammonium nitrate will include a demonstrated legitimate need, safe and secure storage and handling and background checking, including checking by ASIO. In addition to the key issues of sale and purchase, improving the regulatory regime will need to encompass issues relating to importation, transport and manufacture of ammonium nitrate. The recommendations also include a specific and targeted information campaign regarding the reporting of suspicious activity in relation to fertiliser and explosives. There will also be investigation into the viability and cost of alternative fertilisers with a view to an eventual ban, if that is possible. Many countries have grappled with this issue and there is no easy and simple solution. Australia is more advanced than many in developing an appropriate response. I want to assure the House that the government is concerned about possible misuse, and we would urge the state and territory governments to act promptly in obtaining a uniform and an effective response to these proposals which we are putting. This is a matter in the national interest and further delay is not in the national interest.</DOC>

 - I would point out in reply to the member for Lilley that, of course, I do not have administrative responsibility for the policies of the alternative government. -  - I certainly do not, Mr Speaker. But, as the member for Lilley has sought to compare and contrast - that is what he is trying to do - the policies of this government with the policies of the opposition, let me give him a bit of information. Let me give him what I think they call in the trade `scenarios'. Let me give him the scenario of a couple family with two children with a single income earner receiving -  - No, these are scenarios. The member for Lilley is a scenario expert when it suits him, but let me give him the first scenario -  - A couple family with two children with a single income earner receiving $23,381 a year, in July 2003 compared to January 1996, is $88 a week better off in disposable income terms, is paying $4 a week less in income tax in real terms and is entitled to receive over $76 a week in real terms more in family assistance payments. Let me take another scenario which will no doubt interest the member for Lilley. Let us take a couple family with two children, the primary income earner on, say, $45,470 a year and his wife earning $28,400. That is a combined family income of $73,895 - a not atypical situation. This family in July 2003 compared to January 1996 was $55 a week better off in terms of disposable income in real terms - $55 a week better off under the policies of this government. They were paying $24 a week less income tax in real terms. They were entitled to receive over $15 a week in real terms more in family assistance payments, and that is not counting the child-care benefit. They were paying over $16 less in net child-care costs in real terms. I quote those two scenarios, Mr Speaker, to give you a reminder that the work and family balance can be served in many ways, and the undeniable fact is that it has been better served by this government than any previous administration. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question because, as I have regularly said, I do make a study of Labor Party policy. There was a policy that was released yesterday called `Labor's baby care payment' and - who would have guessed! - it announced the first of Labor's new taxes to be introduced if they are elected at the next election. This policy makes very interesting reading. First of all, there is a $350 million shortfall because they claim savings in 2005-06 of $100 million, in 2006-07 of $130 million and in 2007-08 of $117 million which do not exist. So there are $350 million in claimed savings which do not exist on the forward estimates. The second thing is that it has been repeatedly said -  - The forward estimates are actually in the budget. She says, `Where are these forward estimates?' They are actually in the budget. - You know: you have a budget; you have revenues. Actually in the revenues are the amounts that people pay in tax. - It has been repeatedly said that by 2010 Labor's proposal would amount to 14 weeks of maternity leave. I think that is what Labor have said - by 2010. So, if Labor gets elected in 2004, 2007 and 2010, three terms later it would be three months maternity leave. Let me tell the House that the current federal minimum wage is $448.40 a week, which converts to a take-home wage of $384, 14 times which is $5,376. So 14 times the minimum wage amounts to the $5,380 that Labor talks about in 2010. But can you see, Mr Speaker, what the Labor Party have said? The baby bonus in 2010 will amount to 14 times the living wage of 2004. They forgot to tell you that in the small print: `In 2010 our payment will amount to 14 weeks of maternity leave at the rate of the living wage in 2004.' - Unless, of course, they are assuming that the federal living minimum wage does not increase between 2004 and 2010. Fourteen times $384 is $5,380. Oh, a slight problem! - The third point I would like to outline is as follows. It is claimed that part of this baby care policy will be funded through the abolition of the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme. That is a scheme which guarantees employees entitlements if a company should fail. Does that mean that the Labor Party does not want to guarantee entitlements to employees whose companies fail? - No. Because, as the member for Rankin says, in fact the Labor Party wants to guarantee more than the GEERS. So how could it be that the Labor Party will save money by abolishing the GEERS and yet guarantee 100 per cent entitlements? How could that be? That is because the real funding comes from the new tax to be introduced - a new payroll tax of 0.1 per cent on every payroll for companies over 20 employees. This is a proposal for Labor's first new tax if it is re-elected. That was announced, and the Leader of the Opposition confirmed it this morning on AM, under the policy A Better Way of Life for Working Families - Simon Crean, February 2002. - That does not apply? - The member for Batman said, `That was two years ago,' as if it no longer applied. The member for Hotham said, `You've just caught up with this.' Which is it? A new tax. The only way you can make a saving by abolishing GEERS and guaranteeing entitlements is with a new payroll tax of 0.1 per cent on every payroll for businesses with over 20 employees, and even that will not guarantee 100 per cent entitlements. I want to disclose this to the House: the Commonwealth government abolished Commonwealth payroll tax in 1971.  - The Australian Labor Party has a proposal to bring back the Commonwealth payroll tax in 2005, some 34 years later. We said that a vote for the Labor Party would involve increased taxes. Labor has confirmed today that the first of the new taxes is a payroll tax. In the middle of a baby care proposal the Labor Party has again confirmed a tax increase. On this side of the House we have always believed that payroll tax is a tax on jobs. Payroll tax is a tax on employment. If you want to give people in Australia the opportunity to work - if you want businesses to create more jobs - you will not be introducing a new payroll tax at the next election. What we ought to be doing is taking taxes off employers in this country and giving more young people the opportunity of work.</DOC>

 - That is not the case -  -  - as is admitted by Labor's own policy. Can I read footnote No. 6 to Labor's own policy on this proposal. These estimates which Labor used are from the 2002-03 budget. In the 2003-04 budget, the baby bonus figures were revised substantially downwards.  - That is in your own footnote.  -  - That is in their own footnote. It says here that they were revised substantially downwards and in the forward estimates, as I disclosed earlier, the figures are as follows: $260 million, $300 million, $250 million, leaving a shortfall of $100 million in 2005-06, $130 million in 2006-07 and $117 million in 2007-08. I table the minute from the Treasury. That is the $350 million hole. Secondly, there is the 14 weeks, as I said earlier, based on the living wage of 2004. And, thirdly, there is the baby care payment, funded by a new tax. Some policy, Mr Speaker. It is an absolute ripper! </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question about this important subject. In response to him, may I remind the House that the Australian Labor Party had 13 years in government to introduce minimum community based standards for the protection of employee entitlements in Australia and they did absolutely nothing. It took this government to put in place - through the GEER Scheme, which the Treasurer has referred to - arrangements to protect employee entitlements. Since the GEER Scheme has been in place -   - there has been some $168 million paid by this government to almost 30,000 employees in Australia. These are the employees that the Australian Labor Party purports to represent. But yesterday the Leader of the Opposition said that he would abolish this scheme. He would abolish a scheme that protects the entitlements of workers in Australia and, in its place, he proposes -  - to introduce a 0.1 per cent tax. He proposes to introduce a 0.1 per cent levy on business - another burden for business in Australia. In his statement yesterday the Leader of the Opposition had the temerity to say that this proposal would place `no financial costs on business'. Business thinks otherwise. In its statement yesterday the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that it is calling on the federal Labor Party to abandon its proposal for a new payroll tax on medium and large business. It went on to say this: The existing GEER Scheme, to which industry contributes through business taxation, is both fairer and less likely to damage our economy and the labour market. That is what business thinks about the proposal that the Leader of the Opposition says would not impose any additional burden. So what we have here is the Labor Party saying that it is going to abolish a government funded scheme, yet section 73 of its platform, adopted just a couple of months ago in Sydney, says this:Labor's legislation to protect employee entitlements will be national and ensure that 100 per cent of entitlements of employees are protected. So the question is: who is going to pay for this? The Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party say that, unlike this government, the Labor Party in government is not going to pay for it. On the other hand, he says that his proposal will have no financial costs on business. If the Leader of the Opposition believes that, then he is starting to believe some of the fairy stories that he has been reading. The reality is that business will pay for this. It is another example that you cannot believe for one moment anything that the Leader of the Opposition says. You have got to look precisely at the details of what he proposes. What we have here is another example of the most anti-business, anti-jobs Labor Party in the history of this country. In addition to that, they want to abolish junior wage rates. They want to abolish individual Australian workplace agreements. They want to impose portable long service leave - another burden on business. They want to give the unions a foot in the door of every business in Australia. These are additional burdens on business in Australia. Here is the latest example of how Labor would be bad for jobs, bad for business, bad for workers and bad for Australia. </DOC>

 - I say in reply to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the superiority of a policy is measured by a number of things, including its funding base. After what the Treasurer has just said, I think this is not a very superior policy at all. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for O'Connor for his question. He is someone who has had real experience in business. He has worked in a business; he has run businesses - unlike the Leader of the Opposition and unlike the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who has never worked in business, and unlike the member for Hotham, who has never worked in business, and unlike the member for Fraser, who has never worked in business. They have always relied on someone else's hard work. They have never had to rely on their own hard work, unless of course -  - Yes, John Curtin House. -  - It is a good business. In fact, it is part of the property business: funds management. The Labor Party should join the Property Council. In this House there are often some very good contributions. There is some great debate. People are often prepared to stand up for what they believe in. I have been trawling through Hansard looking for words expressing concern about payroll tax, and I came across these words:... it is absurd for state governments throughout Australia to be taxing labour inputs with payroll taxes.That is a legitimate concern, isn't it? You would have thought it had come from the coalition - someone in the Liberal Party or someone in the National Party who expresses concern about the impact of payroll tax on labour. But, do you know what, Mr Speaker? When I trawled through and found these words, I discovered they came from the member for Werriwa, who was concerned about the impact of payroll taxes on labour and employment. So what a surprise that yesterday the member for Werriwa, the Leader of the Opposition, should announce that the Labor Party is going to introduce a national payroll tax. In this House, in Hansard, he says the payroll tax is insidious, yet yesterday, as Leader of the Opposition, he pledges to introduce a new national payroll tax. Isn't it a bit hypocritical to say that - flipping and flopping, carpet-bombing these sorts of ideas around and hoping that one of them will hit the target? What a shame.What the member for Werriwa and most of his colleagues who have never worked in business do not understand is that payroll tax keeps small business small. Payroll tax is a tax on jobs. Payroll tax is a disincentive to employment. Payroll tax turns people away from making that additional job available to another person. We estimate that there are 50,000 small businesses on the threshold of going over the 20-employee mark - 50,000 small businesses that now have a disincentive to employ someone because the Labor Party has pledged to introduce a new national payroll tax. There is something else that the Labor Party does not understand. The Labor Party does not understand how the red tape of a new national tax can impact on small business and other businesses. Of course, state payroll taxes are based on payroll - they are based on the size of the payroll. For example, in New South Wales it is about $600,000. That is one form of paperwork for business. - Now the Labor Party wants to introduce a new national payroll tax that is based on the number of employees. - It is not based on the number of employees? - Mr Speaker, how is business going to deal with seasonality issues? How is a farmer going to deal with fruit pickers? Suddenly a farmer may have 40 fruit pickers over one month. Does that bring them into the national payroll scheme of the Labor Party? What about a pub that might be employing an additional few people over the Christmas period? As the member for O'Connor would know, it can be very seasonal working in pubs or restaurants. How are they going to account for that new paperwork? This approach to policy is scattergun. It has a real impact on business, it has a real impact on jobs and, significantly, there is a disincentive for employment. Once again we see the Labor Party not thinking through the impact of policy. They are coming out with a policy a day that is not focused on creating jobs; it is focused on destroying jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question and also for his very strong interest in major projects, not only in the electorate of Hinkler but also right around Australia. Since July 2002, Invest Australia has helped to attract some 43 investments to Australia, representing a total dollar investment of $3 billion, and creating over 3,000 jobs for Australian workers. Invest Australia also supports the strategic investment coordination process which, since it was created, has brought about some 6,500 jobs by attracting footloose projects to Australia. These jobs would not have been created under the Labor policy that we heard announced yesterday. The baby payment policy will be funded through the abolition of Invest Australia. The reality is that, whilst Invest Australia has a very good track record, particularly in terms of creating projects like the $1.4 billion project from Comalco in the electorate of Hinkler, this process will be stopped under Labor.There is a whole range of good examples of investments made in Australia as a result of Invest Australia's actions. We have seen $450 million invested by Visy Paper in Tumut to create some 400 jobs; some $400 million invested by Holden in their new V6 plant in Melbourne, creating some 550 jobs; and, of course, $1.2 billion invested in the high-smelt plant in Western Australia, which is currently employing some 1,600 people in its construction.When we talk about the projects that have succeeded under Invest Australia, the Leader of the Opposition has actually seen this success first-hand. In fact, about a month ago he visited the Comalco refinery at Gladstone and spoke to its workers, but he did not mention to them then - perhaps he had not made up his mind at that stage; perhaps he only made it up yesterday when he announced the policy - that in fact projects like the one that Comalco is building in Gladstone may be the last for that area. He did not mention that he had a plan to abolish the exact process that put that project there. He did not mention that, under a Labor government, not only would that project attract a new tax in the form of a wages tax but he would not be inviting other companies to come to Australia.The reality is that the policy announced yesterday to abolish Invest Australia will abolish the opportunity to bring 70 major projects to Australia. Some of them might go to the member for Hinkler's electorate, some of them will go to other parts of Australia, but the impact of the Leader of the Opposition's poorly thought through policy to abolish Invest Australia is that 70 major projects - with a prospective investment of $90 billion and producing 17,000 jobs - just will not happen. Abolish the process and you will not go out in the global environment, you will not attract those projects to Australia and you will not create those jobs in Australia. It is just another example showing that the Labor Party is bad for business in Australia and bad for jobs in Australia.</DOC>

 - In reply to the honourable member for Rankin, I think new mothers need financial assistance. They need choices. They need the opportunity of work. They need to have a husband who has secure employment. They need to have the reality and the prospect of low, affordable interest rates. They need to have the option of child care. They need, in other words, to have a whole range of benefits, and - as I indicated to the member for Rankin's colleague a few moments ago - by any comparison those benefits and those choices have been greatly expanded under this government. As I have indicated in the past, this government leaves open still further enhancements of those benefits and those choices. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning very much for his question, and I note in passing that there are now four new doctors in his area as a result of the government's More Doctors for Outer Metropolitan Areas program. MedicarePlus means an extra 1,500 doctors and 1,600 nurses in general practice by 2007, but the benefits are flowing already. Late last year, the visa for temporary resident doctors was extended from two years to four years. One hundred and forty-two overseas-trained doctors have already been granted these new visas. Most of them are already in practice and all of them are working in areas where there are not enough doctors.But let me make this point: overseas-trained doctors can answer a short-term problem, but they are not the long-term answer to this issue. The long-term answer is Australian-trained students serving Australian communities as doctors. Thanks to the MedicarePlus package, there are an extra 234 medical students starting this year. On graduation, they will be working in areas of work force need. There are 234 extra medical students as a result of MedicarePlus - that means 1,704 first-year medical students this year: an all-time record, thanks to the policies of the Howard government. MedicarePlus is a $42 million investment in more medical students, and it means a long-term 16 per cent boost in the number of medical students in this country and ultimately the number of doctors in this country.I have been asked about alternative policies. The policy of the opposition is to take away all the MedicarePlus benefits. The baby payment scheme that they announced yesterday involves ripping the guts out of MedicarePlus. It involves taking away the `for and on behalf of' MBS item for allied health professionals. I say to the members opposite: you do not help Australian families by robbing them of their brand new safety net.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mackellar for her question because in the 48 hours since this matter was last raised in the House the fleece meter has notched up an additional $13,442 free gift to the Australian Labor Party. Since 2 December, when the sensitive new age guy became the opposition leader, he has trousered more than $800,000 towards his election campaign, courtesy of the rent rort. The Sydney City Council election demonstrated what happens to the authors of transparent political scams and get rich quick schemes. And the Leader of the Opposition refuses to do anything about the stinking dead cat in federal Labor's backyard. Thanks to the sweetheart deal between the former Labor government and the Australian Labor Party, taxpayers have to pay $871 a metre for office space in Centenary House and the commercial tenant in the same building pays just $314 a metre. Thanks to this rent rort, office space in Barton costs more than office space at 101 Park Avenue and the Manhattan Tower in New York.Over the last few days, I have been travelling the world on the Internet, looking for office space which is more expensive than Centenary House, Barton. I thought the Leader of the Opposition, being a disciple of Keating and Whitlam, might be more interested in a French comparison than an American comparison. After all, he enjoyed the hospitality of the Whitlams in Paris in the 1980s. When he was the Mayor of Liverpool, he built a fountain modelled on the Pompidou Centre. In fact, it was the Pompidou Centre look-alike fountain which helped explain why Liverpool council was $30 million in the red at the end of his tenure.Let me tell the Leader of the Opposition that rents in Paris are so high that last November the Paris Business Bureau had to leave because it could not afford the rent. According to the 2003 NAI real estate planning guide, rents in Paris average $900 a metre - that is a little bit more than the current Centenary House rent but a little bit less than it will be in September when the nine per cent ratchet clause kicks in. On my travels, I noticed a villa on the Riviera - the last word in ostentation and luxury - with a swimming pool, servants' quarters and olive grove thrown in. It is just the place for the headquarters of the Labor Party, I thought - and the rent there is just $634.What all this proves is that the Centenary House rent rort is the mother of all rip-offs. The Leader of the Opposition says that he wants to be a new style of Labor leader. Actions speak louder than words. If the Leader of the Opposition wanted to prove he is not just another Tammany Hall thug, he would end the rent rort now.</DOC>

 - It is always entertaining to get questions from the member for Lilley, particularly when it comes to the issue of families, because most of the time he is trying to scare the bejesus out of them. So it is always nice when he comes up with some new ideas. We know where this new idea for the baby care payment came from, don't we, member for Lilley? - It was a quickly convened press conference yesterday to keep attention off the Leader of the Opposition over his inconsistent policy on Iraq. They quickly and hastily arranged a press conference in Queanbeyan -  - I always respect your opinion, Mr Speaker. I withdraw the remark. The point I want to make is about the genesis of the ALP's baby care payment that was hastily announced yesterday, more as a distraction from their embarrassment over their position on Iraq. It is interesting to note where the actual policy position came from. We know, of course, that it came from a leaked work and family task force document. They could not even come up with a new name - they had to actually plagiarise it.When it comes to this government assisting families, as the Prime Minister has mentioned on numerous occasions in question time today, with the substantial increases in the family tax benefit, it is all about assisting young families with children. That is why, with family tax benefit alone, it is $4,800 for family tax benefit part A and over $1,200 for family tax benefit part B, not to mention the enormous amount of money we have given in child care benefits. I always agree with the Prime Minister. He has tremendous vision when it comes to assisting Australian families. This government will no doubt be doing many more things to assist families in this country. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parkes for his question. The member for Parkes represents one of the largest electorates in Australia, in New South Wales. He recognises the extensive benefits that will accrue to many of his constituents from the conclusion and implementation of a free trade agreement with the United States of America. Not just the agricultural producers but also service providers and many of the manufacturers and the small business people in his electorate who are engaged in exporting out of Australia look forward to increased opportunities in the market in the United States. We will see greater investment flows and greater trade flows come out of this agreement when implemented.The agreement has been widely welcomed by businesses across Australia. Whether they be agricultural producers, processors, exporters, service providers, financial institutions or manufacturers, they have all welcomed this historic accord that has been struck with United States. Despite this broad support within the community, the Leader of the Opposition still opposes the agreement.  - It is a bit instructive that the day we announced that the agreement had been struck, the Leader of the Opposition could not wait to get out of the door and bag it. It was more policy on the run, as we have seen in the last week or so from the Leader of the Opposition - unresearched announcements about policy that he announces off the top of his head.He did not take the time to study it, he did not seek a briefing on it, nor did he consult his colleagues on it - he just organised a media doorstop. He said, `If we were asked to vote on it today, or in the parliament tomorrow, we would be opposing it.' He did not say, at that point, `We'll wait and see if it is in the national interest.' He said, `We'll vote against it; we'll oppose it.' He said that straight off the top of his head, without any briefings and without any research. Nothing he has said since then has indicated that he has changed his position. All he has done, off the radar screen in his local media, in the Macarthur Advertiser, is link the FTA with his anti-American politics. He was implying in one comment that we sent troops to Iraq so that we could get an FTA with the United States of America - an outrageous allegation that we have refuted.This is not the behaviour of a leader of a major political party in Australia. It is not the behaviour of a leader of the alternative government of Australia. This agreement that we have struck with the United States is not about Iraq and it is not about next election; it is about the next generation, the decades to come of the Australian economy, and jobs for Australians. The coalition government is about being creative and looking for new and better ways of creating opportunities internationally to develop and secure jobs in Australia. We are about creating jobs, not creating taxes on jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert. I know that he represents many Australian Defence Force personnel very ably up in Townsville. The Australian Defence Force personnel in Iraq are performing vital tasks. They are providing security for Australian officials at our representative office in Baghdad, they are helping to train the Iraqi army and navy so that the Iraqis can provide proper security for themselves, they are providing air traffic control support, and they are patrolling the Persian Gulf in HMAS Stuart and two P3C Orion aircraft.Last month, the Leader of the Opposition said that he thought that all of this was symbolic - that the ADF were not, in other words, doing anything useful but there for symbolic reasons, as though providing protection for our diplomats and other officials was not a useful function but just a symbolic function. As we pointed out at the time, it is an offensive thing to say about Defence Force personnel who risk their lives. HMAS Stuart, for example, played a critical role in rescuing American personnel wounded in action against a terrorist attack on the Basra oil terminal. The ADF is making a difference in terms of the training of Iraqi military personnel.The member for Griffith has been out there in the last couple of days launching into Australian personnel by suggesting that somehow we are culpable for the abuses that some British and American personnel have been conducting in Iraqi prisons. The government roundly condemns the abuse that has taken place in those prisons - it is an appalling thing - but there is no record of Australian Defence Force involvement in those abuses and no record of Australian involvement in those abuses. If I may say so in answering the honourable member's question, it is a bit rich coming from the opposition to hear this moralising about what the Americans and some British personnel are alleged to have done in these prisons, which is appalling and we condemn it.  -  - If you had your way, Saddam Hussein would still be in power - a regime whose human rights abuses, including in the Abu Ghraib prison, ranked amongst the most horrific reported. Apparently the fact that 260 mass graves have been found with 300,000 corpses in them is not a matter of any interest to the opposition - that does not matter; it is not important. Actually, that is important. That is enormously important. This was a regime whose brutality had been tolerated by many in the international community, and now it is gone. Now that regime is no longer there.This is a regime which denied the International Committee of the Red Cross access to its prisons. The Coalition Provisional Authority has given that access to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Abuses have been exposed, maltreatment has been exposed, and quite rightly the Americans and the British are taking action against those responsible for those abuses. Those abuses are completely unacceptable, but it ill becomes people who think that the better policy was to leave Saddam Hussein in power to moralise about human rights.</DOC>

 - The member for Gellibrand - Lalor, I apologise; both safe Labor seats - asks me about the Treasurer. I am reminded of that remarkable comment I think made by Christopher Wren: if you want to see my work, look around me. Look around at the Australian economy over the last eight years and you see the remarkable work of the Treasurer. The House will hear tonight, and you, Mr Speaker, will also hear because you will be presiding, a story of absolutely heroic economic achievement.The Australian people will hear again that you cannot spend money on health that you do not have from a strong economy. You cannot spend money on education that you do not have from a strong economy. You cannot spend money on the environment that you do not have from a strong economy. You cannot spend money on aged care that you do not have from a strong economy. You cannot spend money on science that you do not have from a strong economy. You cannot spend money on roads that you do not have a strong economy. You cannot spend money on good employment policies that you do not have from a strong economy. You cannot spend money on defence that you do not have from a strong economy. What I believe the Australian people will hear again tonight is the story of the strongest economy in the Western world.  - The member for Lalor was good enough and helpful enough to ask me about the responsibilities of the Treasurer. I am pointing out to her and pointing out to the House, as he will point out to the Australian people tonight, that over the last eight years under his economic stewardship this economy has performed in a stronger and more consistent manner than at any time since the end of World War II. This government, because of its superior economic management, and this Treasurer, because of his economic skills, have delivered the foundation for any government to deliver services and value to the Australian people - and that is a strong economy. If you do not have a strong economy, you cannot deliver benefits. And if you hand over a strong economy to people who have a proven track record of economic mismanagement, of high debt, of high interest rates and of big deficits, you pretty quickly squander your capacity to deliver benefits to the Australian people. That is the contribution the Treasurer has made, and it is a magnificent contribution.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question, for the interest he has taken in the free trade agreement with America and for the support he has provided. The Minister for Trade and his American counterpart, Bob Zoellick, are going to sign the AustraliaUS free trade agreement in Washington on 18 May - just a week away. The agreement still remains on track for entry into force on 1 January 2005. As a new Centre for International Economic Studies report said recently, it could lead to a $6 billion increase in Australia's economic bottom line and create over 30,000 new jobs. -  - No, I know you are not in favour of it, but most Australians I think can see the sense in it. - It is not just the Australian people that can see the sense in this agreement; it is also the state Labor governments that can see that this is an agreement that is in the national interest. What is interesting is, in stark contrast to the federal Labor Party, the state Labor governments are lending their support to it. I note that Queensland's Premier, Mr Beattie, made a speech on 6 May, which was reported in the Financial Review with the headline `Beattie backs trade deal', in which he said `the agreement will prove positive for Queensland and Australia as a whole'. So there we have the successful Premier of Queensland supporting this agreement. The South Australian AttorneyGeneral, Mr Atkinson, acting on behalf of the industry minister, has written to the Minister for Trade expressing South Australia's support for the agreement. He took the opportunity - and I quote - `to congratulate you and your officials on your effort; I have no doubt the task was immense'. This is the Labor government in South Australia supporting the free trade agreement with the United States. The Victorian government, who recently had their budget presentation, are allocating money in their budget to help Victorian companies take advantage of the free trade agreement. This stands in stark contrast to the Leader of the Opposition's negative anti-Americanism. He has had nothing to say about the free trade agreement with Thailand. - He has had nothing to say about the free trade agreement with Singapore, but he has decided to come out and attack the free trade agreement with the United States. When the Leader of the Opposition began in that job, he went on A Current Affair and said:I'm not here in opposition for opposition's sake. And if Mr Howard does something that's good I'll be the first one to say, `Well let's all get behind that'.I call on the Leader of the Opposition to show the leadership that the premiers of Queensland, South Australia and Victoria have shown, get behind the free trade agreement and make sure that Australian businesses and workers are able to maximise the opportunities that this commonsense agreement offers to them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note his real interest in good public transport infrastructure, particularly in relation to the Scoresby, where I can assure him and the House that we will be seeking to hold the Bracks government to its original commitment to build the Scoresby as a freeway. Following the Madrid atrocities, it was agreed that the Australian Transport Council meeting which was scheduled for 30 April in Perth should focus on the issue of land transport security. That happened, and a communique has been issued out of it. Ministers at that meeting were briefed by Dennis Richardson, the head of ASIO, and by the head of my department, who had at that time just returned from leading a mission around the world to closely examine what countries around the world were doing to maximise the security of land transport - in particular, train services and public transport. That mission found that, like Australia, most countries have placed a great deal of emphasis on aviation security and have been and are placing a lot of work and effort into maritime security, but there is now a great focus on mass transit security. It should be noted that, I think, the head of ASIO was right to warn us that the past actions of terrorists are not necessarily any useful guide to their possible future activities. It should also be noted that the Australian government completely recognises that mass transit security is overwhelmingly a state responsibility. Nonetheless, the Australian government accepts that it has a leadership role to play in the collection of intelligence, which is your front-line defence against terrorism, and in the dissemination of that information to the relevant players at both government and private sector levels. It also has a role to play in areas such as coordination and cross-border security coordination arrangements. - I am interested that the member opposite is very concerned to hear of the concerns of his state Labor colleagues about the issue of securing the safety of the travelling public. He is very interested!All Australian governments have agreed on, firstly, the need for an upgraded and nationally consistent approach to land transport security; secondly, the need to strengthen arrangements which cross state and territory borders; and, thirdly, the need for an upgraded approach to the national dangerous goods security program. All states and territories have gone away to progress the various recommendations that are before them. They have asked for a reference to the National Counter-Terrorism Committee. They have also agreed - very interestingly, together - to a public awareness campaign, because they believe that the previous campaign was valuable and we need to build on it.The question that arises out of that for those opposite is whether they will lift themselves above politics in this regard. I suppose that is hopeful, but we will ask them to see whether they can do as their state colleagues have done and lift themselves above politics and support the very real need for a further public education campaign so that we can alert the public to the critical role that they play in securing safety on our trains, in particular, and in our train stations, which are obviously difficult to secure without the full cooperation of the travelling public.</DOC>

 - The Prime Minister comments `A great package'. This government has been very aware of the serious difficulties confronting the sugar industry that are really beyond the control of the industry - corrupt world markets, low prices and, of course, increasing competition from large suppliers such as Brazil - which have had a really devastating impact on this vital Australian industry.We recognise that this industry is important not only to the farmers, the mill workers and the others who are associated with it directly but also to scores of regional towns, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales but also in Western Australia. This industry has contributed mightily to the Australian economy over the years. We believe it has the capacity to do so in the future, but it needs a bit of help now. So the Prime Minister announced at the end of last month a $440 million package to help the sugar industry through the current crisis.The centrepiece of this particular initiative is a $146 million sustainability grant which will provide assistance to everyone in the industry. It will provide additional support for farmers but it will also help the milling sector to ensure that they can survive these difficult times. The second key element is a $75 million regional strategy to help position the industry for a more diversified and secure future. We believe the industry will have to be different in the future. There will have to be significant changes made. The industry will need to focus much more on a wide variety of uses for cane than simply export sugar. We export about 85 per cent of our crop, which means we are very dependent upon the international market.I welcome Dr Khedr's presence in the gallery today. Whilst he is here specifically to talk about wheat - Egypt will probably be our biggest wheat customer this year, so his visit is very important to Australia - he has also expressed to me an interest in acquiring Australian sugar, and so these export markets are also of interest to Australia. But in the future we will need an industry that is doing other things with sugar, and this particular grants program will help achieve some of that diversification. In the interim there will be income support for farmers for 12 months; business planning assistance for growers and harvesters, as well as for the smaller and cooperative mills; and restructuring grants for growers to undertake on-farm improvements.In spite of all that, we accept that there will be some people who will want to make a future outside of the industry. For them there will be crisis counselling available, re-establishment and retraining grants to assist them in whatever new career they might choose, and a special assistance program to enable intergenerational transfer of cane farms through a three-year holiday window from the normal gifting provisions which apply to the age pension. This is the biggest assistance package to an Australian agricultural industry since the states deregulated the dairy industry. We believe it will go a very significant way towards helping the sugar industry through these difficult times. Can I compliment the honourable member for Page for his role in helping to put this package together, along with the members for Richmond, Fairfax, Fadden, Hinkler, Dawson, Herbert, Leichhardt and Kalgoorlie, all of whom have had a keen interest in this. - Yes, all - curiously - government members, who care about this industry and who want to see it go forward. The only real criticism has come from the opposite side, as one would expect, where there has been no commitment to this industry. But we are determined to have a strong and viable industry to share in our nation's future prosperity, and this package will help guarantee that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Denison for that question. Can I take this opportunity to say that I have specifically, in the past few days, had the Australian Ambassador in Washington raise with the Pentagon - with Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz - the question of the interrogation and treatment of the two Australian detainees, Hicks and Habib. I am aware -  - It is a serious question and I am endeavouring to treat it in a serious fashion but, if the opposition want to interrupt, that is fine; it is an indication that they do not treat their colleagues' questions seriously. I am aware of those reports, and they disturb me, and we are satisfied on a number of bases about the treatment of Hicks and Habib. Australian officials, I am advised, have visited Guantanamo Bay on several occasions. They have been able to speak with Hicks and Habib, and with the United States personnel. On those visits, they have seen no evidence indicating that either man has been mistreated. Representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross have also seen both men in the course of regular visits to Guantanamo Bay. Mr Hicks's lawyer, Stephen Kenny, has stated that Mr Hicks gives `credit to those individuals who guard him and have treated him in a decent and human way within the limits set for them'.Nevertheless, given the serious nature of various reports, yesterday morning I rang the Australian Ambassador in Washington, Mr Thawley, to again seek specific assurances from the United States authority that no improper interrogation techniques had been used or would be used. That assurance, I am advised, was delivered by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Paul Wolfowitz, to the effect that both Hicks and Habib had been treated humanely and would continue to be so treated. The government have consistently told the United States that we wish to see these cases resolved expeditiously. Mr Hicks has not yet been charged. Legal counsel have been appointed and are in discussion with the United States authorities. US authorities have advised that Mr Habib is likely to be included in the next list of detainees to be sent to trial.  We will continue to follow this issue very closely. I believe we have taken particular steps to satisfy ourselves in relation to the treatment of the two men, without in any way prejudicing the outcome of any trial in which they will be involved. They are Australian citizens and they are entitled to the interest and the protection of the Australian government, consistent with a proper airing of the charges that may be brought against them. I believe that the Australian government has fulfilled those obligations to date, and it will continue to do so in the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question, and I regret to say that I am aware of proposals to increase taxes on health facilities. I can point out to the House that three years ago the Howard government introduced a brand-new scheme to fully protect workers' statutory entitlements, but now we have a proposal from the Australian Labor Party to reintroduce a federal payroll tax to cover something which the Howard government has already protected. It was a coalition government that abolished the federal payroll tax way back in 1971, but now the Leader of the Opposition wants to reintroduce a tax that has been dead for more than 30 years.About 500,000 Australians work in health care, and a payroll tax as envisaged by the Australian Labor Party is effectively a $25 million cut in health care funding. But what can you expect from members opposite? When it comes to the Labor Party, think Labor, think tax. In their federal history, they have come up with some 20 brand-new taxes - in fact, the Australian Labor Party have had a lifelong love affair with new taxes and higher taxes. In 1992 Labor introduced a training tax. In 1989 Labor introduced the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. In 1985 Labor introduced the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax. In 1984 Labor introduced the resource rent tax. In 1975 Labor introduced the coal export levy. In 1974 Labor introduced the Medibank levy. In 1945 Labor introduced a social security tax. In 1944 Labor introduced provisional tax. In 1942 Labor introduced a war tax and gift duty. In 1931 Labor introduced primage duty and a super tax on property incomes. In 1930 Labor introduced the wholesale sales tax. In 1916 Labor introduced an entertainment tax. In 1915 Labor introduced the first Commonwealth income tax and companies tax. In 1914 Labor introduced estate and succession duty. In 1910 Labor introduced a land tax. - There are at least 20 new taxes that Labor thought of first.   - I point out that nearly all of the 20 brand-new taxes that Labor thought of first have fallen on the health industry and workers in the health care sector. The Leader of the Opposition increased rates when he was mayor and, as sure as night follows day, he would increase taxes and invent new ones if he ever got to be Prime Minister.</DOC>

I certainly will consider the matters that the honourable member has raised, and if there is anything that I think I can usefully add to what he has put to me I certainly will. Let me assure the member for Braddon that this government is deeply committed to the provision of hearing services to the Australian public.

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. He is a great supporter of the resources sector, which of course provides thousands of jobs in his electorate; Australia wide it provides some 90,000 jobs and is our biggest single export earner. As the member for Hinkler and those on this side know, the resources sector is the lifeblood of many regional communities, and it is supported by companies that generate the national wealth which will underpin the family-friendly budget measures which this government will be handing down tonight. The member for Hinkler asked me if I am aware of any threats to the resources sector were a Labor government to be elected. There is almost a constant cascade of anti resources sector policies coming from those who sit opposite. We have already seen the potential policy of a Labor government to wind back the diesel fuel rebate on the resources sector, which will cost that sector some $500 million. I was recently in the member for Kalgoorlie's seat, where the resources sector were outraged at the Labor proposal to abolish AWAs, which are an intrinsic part of the flexibility of the resources sector and the employment of workers in such regional areas. We have just heard of Labor's intention to impose a payroll tax on all Australian wage payers who employ Australians, and that payroll tax of course is of further concern to the resources sector. The resources sector is extremely worried about these antibusiness policies. But it gets worse - it actually gets much worse. Under a Labor government the Labor Party will introduce a `use it or lose it' policy towards retention leases for the resources sector. That policy attacks the very basic tenet of sovereign risk in Australia. Sovereign risk gives Australian companies and global companies that invest in Australia the security they need to make the billions of dollars of investments that create the jobs in Australia. Once the unequalled premier sovereign risk policy that currently exists is threatened by the Labor policy, which is not only `use it or lose it' but `use it the way the Labor Party tells you to or lose it', then the investments that global companies make in Australia will be made elsewhere. That will cost Australia investment, that will cost Australia jobs and that will cost Australia its economic growth.If we want to see what a Labor government does in terms of its policies on sovereign risk, we need look no further than Queensland. Today in the parliament in Queensland a Labor government is introducing legislation to strip away the leases of a global company based in Queensland. That action by a Labor government puts under threat our A1 rating as a country which protects the rights of companies that invest here. Our sovereign risk status is without equal in the world. The Labor Party will threaten that policy and that status. That will cost Australian jobs, that will cost Australian investment and that will cost Australia's economic growth.</DOC>

I cannot off the top of my head recall what it is, but I will find out and I will come back to the honourable member. I do not accept that the treatment of people is in breach of our international obligations.

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question and for his very strong interest in Australian science, and medical science in Western Sydney in particular. This government is constantly thinking about Australia's future and the decisions that have to be taken today in order to create the future that we want and leave the next generation of Australians an economic and social legacy in which we can have confidence. For that reason, last week the Prime Minister, on behalf of the government, announced the most historic investment in Australian research and innovation that has ever been made, of $5.3 billion over the next seven years. That will take to $52 billion the investment in Australian research and innovation by the federal government in the decade from 2001.The initiatives are focused on three priority areas. The first area is quality. As a relatively small country, we need to ensure that very sound investment in research supports the highest quality research wherever it occurs in Australia. The second area is collaboration. As much as we can, we must support collaboration not just between Australian researchers and overseas researchers but also amongst our institutions in Australia, such as the CSIRO and universities. The third priority area is the commercialisation of research. This $5.3 billion package includes, for example, an extra $305 million to the CSIRO over the next seven years to focus on key national priorities for research and commercialisation, including increasing by some tenfold the economic, social and cultural benefits we derive from the use of water; increasing by $3 billion the return that we get from food manufacturing; cutting in half our greenhouse gas emissions; and significantly increasing the efficiency of new energies. The package includes $1.1 billion of additional investment in university research infrastructure - in high-speed transmission in supercomputing, in laboratories and in libraries, and in all of the infrastructure so essential to supporting research in Australian universities.The package will mean a doubling by 2011 of the total investment in regional research through the Australian Research Council and $1.4 billion of additional investment in Australian research. Importantly, every year 20 per cent of that research budget will be committed specifically to collaboration. It also includes 250 scholarships a year so that postgraduate students can undertake a six-month course specifically in research commercialisation. There is $1½ billion to support large and small industries in commercialising Australian research and to support emerging technologies. The government will also be committing $2.8 million to establish and design a quality assessment framework so that, two years from now, Australia's Minister for Science will be able, with much more confidence, to make decisions about allocating this $5.3 billion into areas of research that we confidently know are of the highest quality. As a country of only 20 million people, making up 0.3 per cent of world population, in this century in particular we cannot afford to squander research resources, even with this significant investment, on research which is not of the highest quality. The government will be absolutely committed to see that the CSIRO, our Defence scientists, our university researchers and research organisations across this country work together and produce high-quality research and that, importantly, wherever we can as a country we turn money into knowledge and also knowledge back into money through innovation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question and for his role as one of the major drivers within the government in regard to science and innovation policy formulation. He took as much pride as any other member of the government, if not more, in the announcement last week of Backing Australia's Ability mark II, which again saw record sums directed at science and innovation, specifically $305 million for CSIRO's flagship programs.As a number of members would be aware - certainly all those on this side - CSIRO has some six flagships. They address the largest and most pressing - urgent, even - issues facing Australia, and cover preventative health care, water, food, energy, wealth from oceans, and light metals. It is a collaborative program within CSIRO, bringing in other research agencies, institutions and industry. We have supported them to the tune of $305 million. More narrowly, over the next four years $800 million will be invested in the flagship programs, which will have such a tangible, targeted impact on Australia's biggest social, economic and environmental problems. Of that $800 million, $400 million will come from CSIRO's existing budget and there will be $155 million in additional funding from the government and an estimated $245 million external funding. Over the next seven years this investment will be close to $1½ billion. CSIRO has been placed at the centre of the government's science and innovation strategy. I am asked, `Are there any alternative policies?' There are no policies from the Labor Party, but there is a proposal and it was revealed by the shadow minister for science and research in an address he gave to an audience at the Australian National University on 7 August 2003. This was the topic of his lecture: `Is smashing CSIRO the answer to the research funding crisis?' On behalf of the government I wish to assure the 6½ thousand members of CSIRO, and the wider community, that the answer is a resounding no. But I cannot presume to speak for the Labor Party. I do know from the Labor Party's actions and especially those of the shadow minister for science and research that there is an unrelenting anti-CSIRO campaign - one of denigration on a personal level and of abuse of scientific record. The Labor Party have a campaign against CSIRO. There are no policies to speak of, but I remind the House that I made the point last year that on 14 October we were promised by the shadow minister for science a policy in these terms:A national research and innovation strategy will be announced over the coming period ... That was more than six months ago. The government has a policy; the Labor Party simply do not and never will.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for asking the question. Indeed, I remember a number of years ago going down into the area of McMillan and launching that particular Good Beginnings project. Good Beginnings is a terrific success story. I might say that the coalition government, from the Prime Minister down, have been great supporters of what Good Beginnings is doing. It is encouraging volunteers to go into the homes of families with newborns and give the parents basic life skills to deal with raising children in those early weeks and months. The government is a great supporter of that. Indeed, it was only a couple of weeks ago that the Prime Minister made an announcement that we would fund Good Beginnings nationally with a considerable amount of money - $3 million - over the next four years to ensure they have a solid foundation on a national basis. Ultimately it is up to them where they allocate projects, but, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I will certainly speak to them to ensure that those projects in your area are catered for, as I will do to support Good Beginnings projects right round Australia.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Dickson. I know he has been a great supporter of Australian children. He has operated child-care centres, and he looked after young children in his previous career, in the police force in Queensland - as he does, of course, in his role with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs at the moment. I am delighted to tell the parliament about a very important announcement made by the Prime Minister just before Easter. We committed $365 million to our Stronger Families and Communities Strategy. It is all about providing better opportunities for Australian children through very innovative grassroots projects. This is a considerable investment in the early childhood years. We believe that we should empower local communities to come up with local solutions to find the best answer for children. I would like to talk a little bit about the $365 million package, of which $110 million is geared towards 35 sites across Australia. There will be funding of between $3 million and $4 million, organised and led by a leading NGO - it could be Mission Australia; it could be many others - to target, in those communities, between 2,000 and 3,000 children. We can directly help those children through nutritional programs, parenting programs or discipline programs - a whole range of programs. But it is up to the program organisers to come back to government rather than government telling them how to improve the health and wellbeing of children in those particular communities. There has been a show of bipartisan support. One program was in the Leader of the Opposition's electorate. The member for Gippsland has been a great advocate of Kilmany UnitingCare, which is trying to enhance the lives of children in that community. We have more to announce in the weeks and months ahead. The Invest to Grow initiative is $70 million to support national programs like Good Beginnings, as I mentioned in my answer to the previous question, and things like what Fiona Stanley does with ARACY. It is about local answers, where local communities come up with local solutions to local problems.I would like to congratulate the member for Kalgoorlie, who has been a great advocate of a program we put into his electorate recently to strengthen mining families in the Eastern Goldfields area. Mining families come under enormous pressure when it comes to managing work and family. The $125 million flexible child-care initiative is trying to assist those in in-home care - there are many families who are shift workers, there are many involved in emergency services and there are many in which a child has a significant disability; and even in farming communities child care can go into homes - and there are also incentives for long day care.But what is interesting is the Labor Party's comments on the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy. They have stated that the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy is a hotchpotch of ideas. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition wants to raid the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy - it is all about early childhood, which is surprising - to support their mentoring programs. - In fact, all we hear about from the Leader of the Opposition, particularly in the early childhood area, is a lot of motherhood statements, a lot of rhetoric - but it is very short on detail. I have to say that we are not talking about it; we are actually delivering. The refocused Stronger Families and Communities Strategy is a pre-budget announcement, but it is not the only thing we will be doing for Australian families. Indeed, the Treasurer will have a number of exciting announcements for Australian families tonight that he has been working on with the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has often described work and family as the real barbecue stopper. I hope tonight that Australian families fire up the barbecue at 7.30 p.m. The PM has said that, up until now, we have just had a couple of beers. Australian families should get out the salads. They should marinate the steaks and maybe pop the cork on the Jacob's Creek, because the Treasurer will be hosting one ripper of a barby tonight and the steaks will be sizzling.</DOC>

 - In reply to the Leader of the Opposition, I took a question on this yesterday. This morning the health minister and the Treasurer both indicated that discussions have been under way in relation to this matter with the relevant supplier.   -  - Members of the opposition front bench interject on this. Could I simply say that those discussions have been under way, and quite properly we have been seeking to get an arrangement that is beneficial both for potential sufferers of this affliction and also in circumstances that produce the best result for the Australian taxpayer. There is absolutely no suggestion - as the opposition leader is rather eager to imply, as I think he did at his press conference - that anything that had been said by the minister was in response to what the opposition was doing. This is a terrible affliction. We have of course for some time been funding the groups most at risk. I can inform the House that the Department of Health and Ageing is currently engaged in discussions with Wyeth Australia, the supplier of the vaccine. These discussions will inform the government about the availability of stock and Wyeth's best offer on price. There is currently a worldwide shortage of Prevnar as a result of production upgrades at Wyeth's facilities in the United States. As a result the earliest start date for any universal program would be late this year or early next year. I repeat: the earliest start date would be late this year or early next year.Could I just point out to the Leader of the Opposition that he leads a party that presided over appalling immunisation rates in this country. The immunisation coverage rate fell as low as 53 per cent in 1989-90 for children at 12 months of age. Since the introduction of our Immunise Australia campaign, childhood immunisation coverage rates have increased to an alltime high, with over 90 per cent of children at 12 months of age being fully immunised; in other words, we have taken it from 53 per cent to 90 per cent. So the Leader of the Opposition has few credentials to lecture this government about childhood immunisation.</DOC>

 - The labour force figures released this morning are magnificent news for Australian workers, because once again we have seen a surge in the number of new people being employed. There were 56,200 new jobs created in Australia in April, and 43,300 of those were full-time jobs. The good outcome in April follows hard on the heels of the excellent result in March. Significantly, there was an increase in the participation rate. In other words, because of the strength of the labour market and the confidence of people, more Australians are seeking work and the participation rate rose from 63.7 per cent to 63.9 per cent. As a consequence, despite predictions that there might be a slight rise, the unemployment rate held steady at 5.6 per cent.As I have said to the House very frequently, for the first time since 1968 this country has the golden double of inflation below three per cent and unemployment below six per cent. But the real message in these figures is that they are the product of good economic management. We have low unemployment in Australia because the coalition over the last eight years has run the Australian economy effectively, responsibly and efficiently. The warning in these figures, as in so many other things, is that if the management of the Australian economy were handed over to less competent people, if it were handed over to people who believe in going into debt, running big budget deficits and, importantly, putting the trade union movement back in charge of the workplaces of Australia, if the economy were handed over to the Labor Party, which believes in reregulating the labour market, you would again see unemployment going up, just as you would see budget deficits reappearing and high interest rates returning. We have been able to achieve low interest rates, lower unemployment and the repayment of $70 billion of debt that we inherited from the former government because of good economic policy. It has not been a fluke. It has not been an accident. The economy in Australia is not on automatic pilot, and if the drivers change the economy will change, unemployment will go up again, debt will go up again and interest rates will rise. It is a very strong message, and I know it is understood by the member for Farrer. </DOC>

 - I cannot confirm those figures. Knowing the way in which the Australian Labor Party has been sloppy with facts over the last couple of days, I will not confirm them on the basis of the say-so of the member for Fraser. But what I will say is that the advertising of government programs did not begin with this government. I well remember Mr Bill Hunter being paid very large sums of money to appear on Australian television. I well remember advertising of the One Nation program on television. I well remember the super guarantee - where you watered a plant and the plant grew in front of your eyes - appearing on television.Over the next few weeks this government will make known to the Australian public family assistance benefits which they are entitled to receive and are entitled to benefit from, and we will do it for this reason: if the public is unaware of the benefits to which they are entitled, they can hardly apply for them. It is part of administering the government to actually know your entitlements in order to receive them.I will make one final comment in relation to this. I do think one thing has dramatically changed in relation to government advertising. Beginning in New South Wales and now extending to Victoria, for the first time in my memory, state Labor governments have taken it upon themselves to go into television advertising against the Commonwealth, and they have done that in order to try to make out that in some way they have been financially penalised. Not only is that false, but the Australian Labor Party, which would have you believe in this chamber that it is against advertising, is supporting the most political advertising you have seen through its state governments, at least in New South Wales and Victoria. We will not allow that to go unanswered. You cannot allow false advertising to go up on the television screens, such as that you saw from Premier Carr and you are seeing from Premier Bracks at the moment. You particularly cannot allow that to occur when every single state government is now receiving a bonus from the GST over and above the amount they would have received under the old tax system. Eight Labor state and territory governments are now in a bonus position. Having done the hard work to put into practice those arrangements, we say to each and every one of those state governments that that money should be spent on better services. Instead of running down their services, the state Labor governments should be building up the services and properly spending that GST revenue.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can inform the House that the labour force figures for the month of April showed unemployment continuing at 23-year lows of 5.6 per cent. In particular, in the month of April there were 56,000 new jobs created in the Australian economy and, of those, 43,000 were full-time jobs. That brings to 1.3 million the number of new jobs created since the government was elected. There are 1.3 million more people in work today after eight years of coalition government than was the case when the Labor Party was thrown out of office.The second thing that I think is particularly significant is that this is an unemployment rate below six per cent for eight consecutive months. The last time we had an unemployment rate below six per cent for eight months or more was January 1981, when unemployment was below six per cent for 10 months in a row. If unemployment were to equal that, the performance at the current time would be matched only by going even further back, into the seventies, to try to find a period of sustained employment like we have at the moment.What are the factors that have led to this result? As the Prime Minister said, they are: balanced budgets, low debt, the repayment of $70 billion of Labor's Commonwealth debt, locking in low inflation under an inflation agreement with the Reserve Bank, the structural reform of Australia's taxation system, the cutting of the company tax rate, the introduction of full dividend imputation, halving of the capital gains tax, abolition of financial institutions duty, abolition of the wholesale sales tax, removing taxes from exports, taking bed taxes off for the tourist industry, taking stamp duties off marketable securities and putting Commonwealth-state financial relations on a secure footing. These are all reforms that the Australian Labor Party opposed; they promised that, if they were ever to be elected, they would `roll back'.Government members - Roll-back! - You do not hear the `R' word around here much these days - the old roll-back. You certainly do not hear any of the state Labor governments, which are now all enjoying GST windfalls, talking about roll-back. But there is one thing in particular that Australia could do to improve job prospects for those that are still out of work. It is not something that just this side of the House talks about; it is something that the IMF talks about, that the OECD talks about. In all the economic studies done on unemployment around the world, there is one feature in those economies which are more flexible and have better outcomes - that is, flexibility of hiring and flexibility against unfair dismissal laws. It is noticed, particularly in studies in Europe, that the more difficult the unfair dismissal laws are, the less flexibility there is in relation to hiring, the higher the unemployment rate. Unfair dismissal laws make employers employment-averse; they do not want to run the risk of putting on labour, being caught in a downturn and being unable to adjust their labour force accordingly. We have put to the Senate unfair dismissal law reforms that have now been defeated 41 times by the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party could do something for Australia by getting out of the way and by allowing those laws to pass so that more people in Australia can have work. </DOC>

 - I would have to check the record to find out what advice, if any, was received from Wyeth in April. I will do that and find out whether there is any substance in the allegation that underlies the question asked by the member for Lalor. I happen to have with me a copy of a letter that Wyeth wrote to a medical magazine on 18 February 2004. It states:I am writing to correct a comment attributed to a Wyeth spokesperson in a misleading article in your February 20 publication that suggests that the Government is to blame for the Wyeth pneumococcal vaccine shortage.Wyeth has never suggested that the Federal Government could be held responsible for a factory upgrade that has caused supply constraints on our pneumococcal vaccine globally. Our spokesperson denies having made this suggestion to your correspondent. - The letter continues:We recognise that the vaccine funding issue and issues surrounding supply are complex, and so it might be tempting - and this applies to the member for Lalor, perhaps - to simplify the situation by laying the blame on the Government, as is so often the case.Our temporary supply constraints are just that, and we are looking forward to working with both the Government and the medical profession to implement a comprehensive universal pneumococcal vaccine campaign for all Australian children. - The letter continues:I would request that this correction to the February 20 story be put on the public record in your next edition.I will table that letter. I will also table a letter that I wrote to the Managing Director of Wyeth Australia dated 6 May which, inter alia, thanks them for their advice regarding the price discount Wyeth is now offering to the Australian government for supplying this vaccine. I go on to say: Accordingly, I have asked the Department of Health and Ageing to explore the details of your offer as soon as possible in their ongoing discussions with you. - That letter is dated 6 May. It is utterly consistent with what the health minister and the Treasurer have said this morning. This matter has been under very active consideration. We are doing the right thing by the parents of Australia as well as by the taxpayers of Australia.</DOC>

 - The budget which the government handed down on Tuesday night was the seventh surplus budget of this government. It delivered $19 billion of assistance to families, it cut income taxes across the forward estimates by $4.7 billion and it introduced a new superannuation incentive of $2.7 billion which is available to all employees up to an income cut-off of $58,000. What is more, it is fully funded and it enables the Australian budget to stay in surplus over the forward estimates.The Australian Labor Party, and in particular the Leader of the Opposition, have been promising for some time that they would lay out their own tax plan this week. When he was asked by Jon Faine, `So you would change the bracket limits? The thresholds?' the Leader of the Opposition said, `You will find these things out in budget week and the debate that will be had then.' Tonight, obviously, the Leader of the Opposition plans to announce his tax package, because he has been so critical of the government's, including his criticism that the government did not allow his family an income tax cut - a rather curious criticism which he made yesterday.The Leader of the Opposition has encouraged newspapers today to speculate on the size of his tax cuts. The Sydney Morning Herald promised us that Labor would `rush to trump' those tax cuts, meaning that his tax cuts would be larger. The Australian today told us that Latham's tax cuts will be bigger than the government's tax cuts. So, tonight, what we have been led to believe we will get, and what those newspapers will demand, is the income tax thresholds, the rates, the costings and how they will be paid for. That is what the Australian people deserve, isn't it? You would not expect the Labor Party to be opportunist enough to oppose what the government has proposed, promise that they would put forward their own tax plan and then dingo out in the budget reply.The other thing I want to say about these tax cuts - after they have been announced tonight by the Leader of the Opposition - is of course they will have to be paid for. Let me just make this point: when you are looking for savings to pay for tax cuts, it is savings against the forward estimates. You cannot save something if it is not expenditure in the forward estimates; it has to actually be in the forward estimates if you are to save against it. Some of the so-called savings that the Australian Labor Party have put forward are not even in the forward estimates. Let me give an example. One of them, they say, is that they will not proceed with choice for public servants in relation to superannuation -   - It is long gone, the member for Fraser says. All right; we will take that one. That was actually the largest one they had left, and that is long gone! Good. We agree on that. That was $780 million and it is long gone. Of the only other two that I can actually find that are still on the table of these savings - and no doubt we will be enlightened tonight - one is that they are going to abolish the employee entitlement scheme GEERS. That is not really true. They are going to keep the scheme but, instead of funding it from the budget, it is going to be funded with a new payroll tax. So that is fair enough; they have got money from the new payroll tax which they can spend tonight. The only other one that I can find, which was announced, I believe - of all things - in the higher education package, is that they are going to reduce the diesel rebate for the mining industry. I believe the reduction in the rebate is from 100 per cent to 90 per cent. One thing to call a reduction in a rebate is a saving; another is to call it a new tax, because what that means is you pay the excise and you only get a rebate of 90 per cent instead of 100 per cent.So we are now down to the situation where there are no savings on superannuation, which happened to be the opposition's largest saving, and there are two things left which are designed to pay for tax cuts - and have a guess what they are: they are both tax rises. One is a payroll tax and the other is an excise tax. So we are down to a situation where the Labor Party, even if they were to reallocate both of those amounts, would not in fact be cutting taxes; what they would be doing would be changing taxes - changing them from excise and changing them from payroll - into the income tax cuts which they presumably are going to announce tonight. The only thing I say is, if Labor want to be an alternative government, they have got to be able to withstand scrutiny, and tonight is the night when this can be announced. Let us put it out there, let us have the opportunity to analyse it and let us know, most of all, how it is being funded.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can only assume that he is softening us up for some announcements which he proposes to make tonight. As far as this government is concerned, since this government came to office there has been no increase in the income tax; in fact, it has been cut. There has been no increase in the wholesale sales tax; in fact, it has been abolished. There has been no increase in the company tax; in fact, it has been reduced. There has been no increase in the capital gains tax; in fact, it has been halved. In this budget, in relation to wine equalisation tax, an exemption was given. In relation to the petrol excise, Labor's indexation was abolished. In fact, if that had not been done, the price of petrol, I am led to believe, would be 5c a litre higher today than it actually is. This government has not increased taxes. This government has abolished some, reduced others and changed the thresholds in relation to the remainder.Since we are on the business of increasing taxes, we all recall - and I cannot get away without recalling it, because it does bring back to mind the last time Labor won an election - that the last time Labor won an election in this country was in 1993. During that election, Labor campaigned on the basis of opposing a GST. When Labor was elected, it hiked all wholesale sales taxes, it abolished the income tax cuts which it had promised - no, it had not promised them; they were l-a-w - and it increased the petrol excise. When you have form like that, you do not want to start asking questions like this.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question. I have said this before in the House: she has shown a particular interest in the human rights situation in Iraq and she has continued to follow it. I appreciate very much the sincerity and compassion she shows on that issue. The government, and I think just about all Australians, are absolutely appalled by the barbaric slaying of American civilian Nick Berg, which was grotesquely displayed on a terrorist web site. We condemn this act of evil, and obviously I am sure I speak on behalf of all Australians in saying that we extend our sympathy to Mr Berg's family and friends.We should not be duped by claims that this was somehow justified as revenge for the abhorrent abuses of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison, because there is no justification under any circumstances for the brutal killing of an innocent man in that way. This act simply demonstrates that the perpetrators are morally bankrupt fanatics, and none more so than the executioner, who is reputed to be the terrorist mastermind Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Their sole aim - and you have to think about what these people are trying to achieve - is to drag Iraq into a state of anarchy, to ensure that it becomes a failed state and to deny Iraqis stability and normality in their lives and the freedom that they have sought for 3½ decades. I take the opportunity, too, of saying how I appreciate the comments by the United Arab Emirates information minister, who said, `This disgusting brutality can never be justified and has nothing to do with Islam or with our Arab values.' - Exactly - as the Prime Minister says, hear, hear to that. The slaying of Mr Berg only reinforces our view that we have to stay the course, make sure that an interim government can be established in Iraq and make sure that Iraq can have sufficient Iraqi security to underwrite the stability of the country. The alternative of just fleeing from Iraq in the teeth of people like Mr al-Zarqawi is to hand the country over to those people. That would be the most monumental victory for evil and the most monumental victory for terrorists that you could possibly imagine. Simply the worst imaginable thing to do in the teeth of this sort of opposition is just to run away and leave Iraq as a failed state. The killing of Nick Berg only reminds us that we do not want to see that country handed over to the sort of people who put Mr Berg to death.</DOC>

 - Families need to know about numbers of benefits. Families will have to know of numbers of benefits because numbers were introduced or increased on budget night. There will be advertising in relation to superannuation incentives, as there is at the moment, all in accordance with established precedent. Was this the first government to advertise superannuation incentives? The Australian Labor Party advertised the superannuation guarantee, which was actually a compulsory deduction from people's pay packets. It was not a question of actually paying some money across - it was taken out by the employer. There was no need to advertise anything, yet the Australian Labor Party went on the heaviest advertising campaign I can recall. So those ads, with the pink piggybanks showing $1 going in for $1, which will now be $1.50 for $1, have to be advertised. It will have to be advertised that new mothers are going to be eligible for a maternity payment. - What do you think new mothers do the moment they give birth to a child? - I am outlining to the House those measures which were introduced in the budget that people will have to apply for or know about in order to get benefit. I have talked about the superannuation co-contribution. I am talking also about the maternity payment. Mothers will have to know that they are entitled to a $3,000 maternity payment if they are going to receive it. There is no point in introducing a maternity payment of $3,000 and then not letting mothers know that they are eligible for it.In relation to the family tax benefit, yes, when people have children they do have to apply for the family tax benefit. It is not automatically paid; when a child is born parents have to fill in the forms to get their family tax benefit. That is the way in which it works. It might be part A or part B. There is no magic computer that just finds these people somewhere and sends the money out to them. Those advertising campaigns to let people know of their entitlements are in accord with practice. They are necessary so that people can get the benefits, and without them many people would miss out on their benefits, which I am sure nobody in Australia would want to happen.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. We have been particularly active in the area of aviation safety, particularly since September 11, 2001, with great emphasis on the so-called category 1 airports, as they were known, which are predominantly jet based airports, based on risk assessments. We rely heavily on risk assessments - to rely on any other approach is to ensure that you misdirect your efforts and your resources.Beyond that, there are two areas into which increased effort is going that I would like to outline to the House today. They are the regional airports and the broader regional airports and seaports in the Asia-Pacific area. It was announced in the budget that the government has decided to spend an additional $21 million on aviation security funding for airports in regional Australia on top of the $93 million that was announced last year as part of our aviation security enhancement package. That makes a total of $35 million that has been made available via direct assistance to some 140 smaller airports to implement a wide range of security measures. We will not be requiring a matching contribution from those airports.  - Many of us on this side represent smaller communities with small airports which are quite isolated in many cases and belong to communities which cannot carry the burden of upgrading that security for themselves. We will now be taking that forward. - This is a responsible, wide-reaching and carefully targeted response, rooted very firmly in the risk profile - I want to stress that - for regional aviation and airports. Reputedly, our political opponents in this matter have a limited scheme. They propose to provide screening at around 10 additional regional airports, those with a throughput of 100,000 passengers per year. That is a highly ineffective proposal; we have looked at it very closely. - If the shadow minister for transport and infrastructure would like to know why - or indeed if the member for Braddon would like to know why - I would like him to seek information not from us but from the security assessment agencies responsible for -  - No, you are quite welcome to a briefing. - This is a very important issue, and I think people are interested in aviation security. But one of the main issues with the idea of screening some but not all airports in the way proposed by Labor is, in fact, to be found in the concerns expressed by the member for Braddon. Under his proposal, one of the airports he is concerned about would be screened; the other would not. They are 40 minutes drive apart. The intelligence agencies will tell you very quickly that that is a very silly thing to do. Somebody intent on doing something silly will turn up, find one screen and drive a few minutes down the road to the other one. It increases risk. That is why I say that that is not the Labor Party's policy. I say they should seek advice from the experts on this. If they will not take it from us, then they ought to seek a proper briefing. We are determined to target resources carefully and properly to maximise the security of people who are travelling in regional Australia.The other area relates to the Asia-Pacific region in which we live. I think it is fair to say that we are playing an important role and a role that is appreciated and respected in the region. The Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to this yesterday in general terms. There is substantially more funding for our neighbours but, as a subset of that, we are doing considerably more in relation to capacity building in a range of Asia-Pacific nations - the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. We are training personnel from Pacific island countries as they seek to develop, implement, put in place and then run their security plans. In particular, we are very active in Papua New Guinea, where we have already installed, and now have operational, four high-tech airport screening devices. We have trained personnel and, indeed, under the enhanced cooperation program we are supplying aviation and maritime security experts to work in relevant agencies in Papua New Guinea. There is considerable extra resourcing going into this as a result of the budget decision. We will spend more money and resources over the next four years in the interests of helping those Pacific neighbours of ours upgrade their security, not only for the sake of their own residents but for other nations in the region as well. </DOC>

 - There may be plumbers that earn $800 a week, but I can assure you there are many more that earn a lot more than $800 a week. That is the first thing I say. I do not know where the member for Hotham has been recently, but plumbing is a pretty good occupation these days - highly skilled. I would not be surprised if there were plumbers that were earning $50,000 or $60,000 a year or more, and they are precisely the kind of people who should have incentive to work harder in this country. So let us not get too worked about the particular incidents.The member for Hotham loves this kind of thing. He always likes to make out as if we are altering these scales for ourselves. He says, `I'll get a tax cut.' What I cannot understand is this: the member for Hotham wants to run what he regards as envy politics - that is, saying, `There are higher income earners getting tax cuts.' The member for Werriwa wants to go on the Howard Sattler program and complain that the tax cuts are not enough. There he was on the Howard Sattler program complaining that he did not get a tax cut, and he has the member for Hotham up here complaining that he did get a tax cut.If the member for Hotham says that it is unfair that people on this side are getting tax cuts, does he think it is unfair that the member for Werriwa was getting one? Did he use that in the question? No, of course he did not. After I alerted the House to what had been said on the Sattler program, we went and had a look at the ALP web site. I invite people to have a look for the transcript of the Sattler interview, because, on the web site, there is a Sattler interview of the day after the budget. But get a load of this: it was not the one that happened yesterday. A Sattler interview from back in April is posted as the 12 May transcript.I have alerted the House to this before: the airbrushing of the web site. If it had not been for us finding that transcript you would have gone to the ALP web site in vain. It has been a practice, I have noticed, by the Leader of the Opposition. He does not put out his transcripts. I have said to this House before: the ones that are not put out are the ones you really want. Go for those every time.Let us come back to plumbers. As will be revealed tonight, the Labor Party presumably will have a large income tax cut for people on $800 a week. - I am waiting for a reaction, Mr Speaker. - You would not ask a question complaining that plumbers on $800 were not getting big enough tax cuts without announcing your own plan tonight about how big the tax cuts should be.  - That would be opportunism, wouldn't it, to stand up and complain without announcing how it should be done tonight? Let us go to those people. Those people will have families and they will be big beneficiaries. Those people can make superannuation contributions and they will be big beneficiaries. Those people were beneficiaries of income tax cuts in 2000 and in 2003. As I told the House yesterday, after the introduction of these additional tax cuts, those who are the lower income earners will still have had the largest percentage income tax cut since the year 2000, because we are now bringing in the last leg - that should have been passed in 2000 - and the last leg, hopefully, will be passed before 30 June.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dickson for his question. I can inform him and the House that the MedicarePlus safety net is the most important structural improvement to Medicare since it first commenced back in 1983. Thanks to the safety net, half a million Australian individuals and families every year will benefit from higher Medicare rebates once their out-of-hospital, out-of-pocket medical expenses exceed $300 or $700 in a year. The latest figures from my department show that already 56,000 individuals and families are benefiting from these higher Medicare rebates. These are 56,000 individuals and families who are going to be left in the lurch by Labor's plan to rip the guts out of the MedicarePlus safety net. Labor's plan to force GPs to bulk-bill is not going to help these people either, because only 13 per cent of their expenses are derived from GP costs.I can inform the House that the Leader of the Opposition was once a strong believer in safety nets. He told this House:This nation's egalitarian values should always be reflected in the maintenance of a compassionate and effective safety net for those who require public assistance.On another occasion the Leader of the Opposition told this House:The methodology of good health reform is to get effective public safety net provisions in place ...That is what he said then, but now you have the member for Lalor, the shadow minister, saying, `We won't be operating this sham safety net arrangement.' I can say this: it is not a sham safety net, but it is a sham Labor Party when they want to take away higher Medicare rebates from half a million Australians in need.</DOC>

 - No, because before the government started amending these tax and family incentives a family on $50,000 would have been on a marginal tax rate of 43c. The phase-out in relation to their family tax benefit would have been 50c. That is where it was. The first round of tax cuts reduces that 43c marginal tax rate to 30c and, in the year 2000, the phase-out was reduced to 30c. So it came down from 43c and 50c to 30c and 30c. In addition to that, with an increase in the family tax payment, depending on the various levels, we have changed the taper from the maximum to the minimum rate. That is all consistent with reducing effective marginal tax rates, which we have done not only on family tax benefit part A but also on family tax benefit part B with the second income earner.The cameos in this document are accurate. I saw the most extraordinary press release I think I have ever seen, issued by the member for Lilley yesterday, claiming that these tables were inaccurate. It bears reading. I may have been the only person who read it. I hope for your sake I was. - As these cameos show, on all of those income distributions the family assistance increases. This document separately shows those who are entitled to tax cuts the additional amount that they will receive. It separately shows the increases in the government superannuation co-contribution. In all of those cameos it shows that none of those $10,000 distributions are worse off. In fact, all of them are better off. Those are entirely accurate. If I may say so, I would urge people to read the member for Lilley's press release, because it would be one of the most deceptive attempts to try to undermine these Treasury figures - which are entirely accurate - that I have seen in a very long time.</DOC>

 - I have seen reports in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Australian of how the Australian Labor Party believes tax cuts should be bigger. I wait for those to be announced tonight. In particular, since the $800-a-week plumber has been cited by the Australian Labor Party, we will be looking very carefully at the increase for those who are on $800 a week under the Australian Labor tax plan. We will be looking very carefully at how it is funded. We will not just be looking at that. The Leader of the Opposition has been claiming that tax cuts should be delivered right down the scale, so we will be looking at tax cuts right down to those who pay tax from the income threshold of $6,000.This is a little bit different from the tune of the Leader of the Opposition yesterday. The Leader of the Opposition complained yesterday on the Howard Sattler program that he was not getting a tax cut. Luckily, somebody was listening to that program because, when we went looking for the transcript thereafter, the transcript did not exist on the Australian Labor Party web site. I thought I should table, because it is probably being airbrushed now, what did appear on the Australian Labor Party web site which was downloaded today. What did appear was a transcript from Radio 6PR, 12 May 2004. The funny thing is that when you read the transcript, which is described as coming from 12 May 2004 - and I table it; I am sure there is an explanation - it begins with an interview about the republic, plebiscites and national security. The interview that we heard yesterday did not involve the republic, plebiscites or national security, so we went back further and we found that there was another radio interview on Radio 6PR on 20 April 2004 that did talk about republics, plebiscites and national security. It appears to me - and I am sure I am wrong and I am sure there is an explanation - that the Sattler interview of 20 April 2004 got rebadged on the ALP web site as the Sattler interview of 12 May 2004. Strangely enough, because the April interview was rebadged as the May interview, the April interview did not contain any complaints from the member for Werriwa that his tax cut was not great enough as listeners on 6PR actually heard yesterday. I table those. They were downloaded today. I have said that there is a tendency in the ALP to airbrush the web site on a regular basis. I am sure there is an explanation as to why that was the case, and I just table them for the House so that the Australian Labor Party can clear up the mystery.</DOC>

 - I will take the points raised by the member for Gellibrand in order. Firstly, I welcome her conversion to the cause of government advertising. It is not surprising. She comes from the state of Victoria whose Labor government has raised the high jump bar in relation to government advertising to unprecedented heights. As for the second part of my answer, no, I have not intervened nor has my office to stop the campaign. Thirdly, she asks about the cost. I will find out, but we do not apologise for altering aspects of the campaign that we regarded as unsatisfactory. As for my featuring in it, to my knowledge the only part that I play is to sign an introduction to the booklet. -  - This is astonishing. The last time I checked I was still Prime Minister. I tell you what: I think it is a very good introduction. I think it is an extremely good introduction. Do you know what it talks about? This is very interesting. I am getting a little bit suspicious of something. It so happens -  - that I actually went through the latest draft of this booklet only two hours ago. I think it is very interesting. I really will have to talk to my staff about this. I am getting a little bit concerned about this. I went through it and I think it is a very good booklet. It talks about respect in relationships. It talks about the desirability of, if you are subjected to a sexual assault, instead of going to a web site, as was in the original proposal, talking to such revolutionary, dangerous people as your parents or your friends or your local priest or your teacher. It is that kind of thing that I was concerned about. I want to thank the member for Gellibrand -   - for raising this matter, because it will give further publicity to the campaign when it is launched. Given the interest she has displayed in it, I will give her an undertaking that I will personally launch the campaign. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for the question and for his abiding interest in assistance to rural and regional Australia. This particular budget provides $2 billion in support for the Australian rural sector. It is the biggest budget in agriculture in the history of our nation. Quite a bit of that is our ongoing commitment to assisting farmers through the drought and support for the sugar industry. It also includes ongoing commitments to those vital programs that have helped underpin progress and development in rural Australia over recent years. There is $238 million over four years to continue the AAA package - the Agriculture Advancing Australia package - including money for Farm Help, FarmBis, the Rural Financial Counselling Service and a new pilot industry partnership program to support industries facing particular challenges. There is particularly good news in relation to natural resource management activities in this year's budget. There will be $460 million available under the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for projects on the ground. Over $300 million of it will actually be delivered through the new regional structures. So that will provide real benefits to our environment and ensure that our farmers have an appropriate natural resource base upon which to build. There is much more money for the Murray-Darling Basin - a matter of keen interest to the member for Barker and other members in that region. Our commitment to the water initiative is funded. Then there is $159 million over four years to guarantee the continuance of the national Landcare program.There will also be nearly $90 million over two years to fund armed patrols in the Southern Ocean to apprehend illegal fishers. That kind of message will be very important for the pirates and others who have been stealing Australia's resources. There is another $40 million to help extend the Great Artesian Basin sustainability initiative to cap those bores which have had water flowing free for far too long. There is $11.3 million to ensure that the government is able to deliver on its commitments made in response to the Keniry review into the live export trade.There is a whole range of measures that have been welcomed by farm industry organisations around the nation. One of particular interest to the honourable member for Barker is obviously the changes to the wine equalisation tax arrangements, which will mean that around 90 per cent of wineries will no longer have to pay any wine equalisation tax. The member asked whether there are any alternative policies. We know the opposition does have an alternative policy in relation to the wine equalisation tax. They have ruled out any concessions to the WET. Publicly they have no support for taking this load, this burden, off our important wine industry.Referring to alternatives, I guess tonight we will find out whether there are any alternatives. But if the opposition leader is up to his usual form, agricultural issues will not rate a single mention during his budget reply. The opposition leader has of course had quite a bit to say about agriculture in the past, particularly when dealing with support for the rural sector in his infamous column in the Daily Telegraph. In February 2001, he attacked venomously drought-proofing investments, the FarmBis program, the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, tax right-offs, water conservation and Landcare expenses, zonal tax rebates, tax concessions for telephone and electricity lines, income tax averaging, education allowances and exemptions from capital gains tax for farmers. Those were on his hit list in February 2001. Now he is Leader of the Opposition, he has a chance tonight to repudiate everything he said about the rural sector in the past. If he does not do so, then the country people of Australia will have the right to assume that he will fund his promises by further slashing rural programs, as Labor governments have done in every state of Australia. It is time for the Leader of the Opposition to stand up in his budget speech tonight and declare a vision for rural and regional Australia that includes farmers and repudiates his previous promises to eliminate these programs funded by this government.</DOC>

 - I welcome the member for Perth's question. The Hogan review was commissioned to undertake a very thorough inquiry into the financial needs of the aged care sector, including operating costs. Of his immediate term issues, the government has responded in full to each of the recommendations. He termed capital as a medium term issue and he suggested that should be considered in the light of 2008. This government has considered the issue of capital now, and over the next four years over $1 billion of capital will be injected into the aged care sector. That more than meets the analysis of capital requirements that this sector needs in fact not only over the next four years but over the next decade. We have met in full the capital requirements of this sector by the $1 billion injection into capital. Our policy on bonds remains unchanged.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question and for reminding this House of the infamous sweetheart deal between the former Labor government and the Australian Labor Party which means that the long-suffering Australian taxpayer spends more for humdrum, nondescript office space in Barton than it would for the best office space in the great city of New York. We all know about the Centenary House rent rort: Labor gets the goldmine and taxpayers get the shaft. Over the parliamentary break, the fleece meter has just kept on ticking over to the tune of $6,721 a day - that means a $270,000 free gift trousered by the Leader of the Opposition since parliament got up in March. If the Leader of the Opposition is looking for savings to announce tonight, if he really wants a fair dinkum saving to announce tonight, I have one for him. He should give himself $36 million to spend on the Australian taxpayer rather than the Australian Labor Party by ending the rip-off now.I remind the House that in 2001 the Leader of the Opposition wrote a book entitled What Did You Learn Today? This was the first time he plagiarised Bill Clinton's 1997 State of the Union speech about reading to kids. What the Leader of the Opposition has learnt today is that he should end the rent rort rip-off tonight - that is what he has learnt today. He plagiarised Bill Clinton's words; I now invite him to plagiarise Bill Clinton's deeds -  -  - well, at least in some respects. On leaving office - and this was one of the good things that Bill Clinton did - he sought publicly funded office space, as he was entitled to do. When he was looking for publicly funded office space, he settled on Carnegie Hall Tower in New York. Carnegie Hall Tower has views of the Hudson River and Central Park. It has sentries on 24-hour guard. Its tenants include the top law firms, the Saudi royal family, Rothschilds and Jerry Seinfeld. They all live in Carnegie Hall Tower in New York. The rent for Carnegie Hall Tower for Bill Clinton was $795 a square metre compared to $871 a square metre in Centenary House for the Australian Labor Party.So expensive was Bill Clinton's rent turning out to be, it would have cost more than the combined rent for all four living ex-presidents in the United States. But what did Bill Clinton - honest Bill Clinton, good Bill Clinton - do? What he said was: `I don't want the taxpayers to get taken for a ride on the lease. I'm not going to let the taxpayers get gigged on this.' There is a challenge for the Leader of the Opposition: is he as honest, is he as truthful, is he as moral as Bill Clinton? We will find out tonight. He should follow Bill Clinton's example in this respect, if none other, and end the rent rort rip-off now.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the reports, and I assume the Leader of the Opposition is referring to the report that was in today's Sydney Morning Herald. I will no doubt get some further information about the accuracy or otherwise of that report. Without in any way wishing to trivialise the matter, I would have thought that it involved fair trading laws for the New South Wales government, for example - just off the top of my head. There may be other laws that are involved, and if there is any further thing that can be done by the federal government it will be done.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby. I note of course that one of the plants of Mitsubishi is located within his electorate, and I know that the member for Boothby, along with many other members on both sides of the House - and I say that very deliberately - takes an interest in this matter. It is a matter of very great regret that the engine plant will close in about 18 months time and that there will, as part of the worldwide recasting of Mitsubishi's operations, be some voluntary redundancies at the assembly plant in Tonsley Park.It is, however, important to say to the parliament that as a result of the direct representations of the federal Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, and the South Australian Treasurer, Mr Foley, and the chief executive of Mitsubishi in Australia, Mr Tom Phillips - who has proved himself to be a redoubtable fighter for the interests of his workers and of his company - the outcome is not as bad as it might have been. I want to record my thanks to my colleague the minister for industry and to the South Australian government. At all stages, I am pleased to say, there has been cooperation between the South Australian Labor government and the federal coalition government. I spoke to the South Australian Premier on two occasions on Friday, and he recommitted himself to working with the federal government. Nothing is to be gained by any political point scoring on this issue.The engine plant is closing and the redundancies are occurring because of the worldwide financial difficulties of the parent company. It is not due to economic conditions in Australia; it is certainly not due to the lack of effort, skill and professionalism of the Australian work force; and it is certainly not due to free trade agreements. I was rather surprised to see the odd comment from one or two union spokesmen that in some way the blame was to be laid on free trade agreements. Can I point out, as did the minister for finance on a program yesterday, that the free trade agreement with the United States will have major benefits for the automotive industry in Australia. Holden, for example, will gain enormously from the free trade agreement. There will be an increase in Holden's export capacity, and it is another reason why the Labor Party should get out of the way and endorse the free trade agreement - the federal Labor Party, that is, because on this issue I am pleased to say state Labor is leading the way inside the Labor Party.The Premier of South Australia said, `The FTA would give us access to 280 million customers.' The Premier of Queensland has already endorsed the free trade agreement, and I understand similar sentiments have been expressed by the Premier of New South Wales and by the Premier of Victoria. Recent modelling by the CIE shows that the free trade agreement with the United States will add $6.1 billion to our national economy. South Australia will share in this.Can I say again to the work force in South Australia that is going to be affected by the Mitsubishi decision: we feel for you; we will do everything we can to ensure that you get alternative jobs. The federal government put in place on Friday, as soon as the announcement was made, a $50 million plan of assistance measures. This includes $10 million in labour market assistance to meet the needs of displaced workers and $40 million for a range of industry facilitation measures that will seek to attract new investment and create new job opportunities in South Australia. We will keep in very close contact with the company management, with the work force and with the South Australian government. And, if the spirit of cooperation that has obtained thus far continues, I believe that in the long run alternative employment and alternative industries will be found, and the economic growth that is now occurring in South Australia - the best for a generation - will in fact be reinforced and will continue.</DOC>

 - In answer to the member for Kingston, let me say that I see no reason why the answer to the first question should not be an emphatic `yes'. The whole purpose of this adjustment is really to provide customised assistance, and that is why the amount involved, given the number of workers involved, is quite large. It is designed to provide customised assistance. As far as the locational specificity of the industry assistance is concerned, I do not want at this stage to commit it to a particular group of suburbs. I think that might at this stage be a little premature, but I do want to say that the purpose will be to attract new industry to South Australia. I mentioned this plan to the South Australian Premier, and I gather he has announced a $5 million program in relation to attracting new investment into South Australia. I think the most sensible, intelligent thing to occur is for Invest Australia, which is the Commonwealth body, and the South Australian government to work together to attract new industry. My aim is to see all of those workers re-employed. Bear in mind that in relation to the engine plant it is 18 months before the plant will close, although I think it is fair to say that there will be some build-up as far as retrenchments are concerned in the period leading up to that. That is my understanding, although that is a matter ultimately for the company to decide.The Tonsley Park plant will be involved in voluntary redundancies. I should stress that there is absolutely no suggestion that any of the workers will lose their full entitlements. They will get their full redundancies. They will get them in full. There is no suggestion that the company will not meet those obligations, and we have received assurances. The whole idea of this labour market assistance program is to get beside the workers as soon as possible and to help them - to help them in a customised, individual way, which I think is appropriate in all of the circumstances. I would be very grateful if the member for Kingston were to feel free to keep in regular contact with my office and the office of the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. If he has any problems, will he please let me know, and I will be very happy to help.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question. I can inform the House that Australian families are assisted in many ways by the budget, which was released Tuesday week ago. Not only have the government changed income tests and taper rates but we have also changed the entitlement to family tax benefit B for a mother who is returning to the work force. She will be able to keep her entitlement - that is, income from employment will not count against entitlement in the year that she returns to work. In addition to that I want to re-emphasise that the government are increasing the benefit under family tax payment A by $600 per annum, starting off with a payment before 30 June. The old maximum payment of $3,401 per annum goes to $4,001 per annum and the old minimum payment of $1,095 per annum goes to $1,695 per annum. That is $600 additional for each family.It is worth reminding people about this because I saw an article in the Financial Review on Tuesday or Wednesday last week interviewing somebody from the electorate of the honourable member for Deakin. This person was saying, `I'm not going to have another baby; therefore, I won't get any benefit under the budget,' and that person was holding two children in their arms. In respect of each of those children there is an extra $600, and within the next 12 months, provided they do their reconciliation in June 2004, they will actually receive two payments of $600 in respect of each of those children. The entitlement has increased per child by $600 per annum.The member for Moncrieff asked me if there are any threats to these payments. Unfortunately, there are some threats to these payments, because, although the Australian Labor Party has said that it will be voting these changes through the Senate, the Australian Labor Party refuses to guarantee that, if it is elected, people will keep their entitlements. People cannot be sure that they will keep either their tax entitlements or their family payment entitlements should the Australian Labor Party be elected. I go first to exhibit A: the member for Kingston. In the Australian of last Monday, the member for Kingston spoke about the tax cuts and the family payments. Listen to this carefully. He said: It is possible to look at the structure of the family tax benefits and the tax changes. It's not like all that money is quarantined ...It is not as if it is quarantined for the people who have received those family tax benefits or received those income tax cuts. It is not as if it is quarantined for them because, as he rightly points out, a Labor government could legislate to take it away from them. His statement could not have meant anything else. That night the press went to the Leader of the Opposition, and the Leader of the Opposition was asked a question. I ask the House to listen carefully to the answer. The question was:... is there any chance of Labor, if it won the election, dropping the second round of tax cuts?Mr Latham replied:We don't plan to do that.Then, when asked if that was a guarantee that Australians will get the tax cuts under a Labor government, Mr Latham replied:... I've answered the question by saying that we don't plan to touch them.He was then asked:Is that a guarantee that you won't?He answered:I've answered the question by saying that we don't plan to touch them.As we all know, plans can change, and the Australian Labor Party most definitely are holding open the prospect of changing their plans and taking back the second round of tax cuts and the family tax benefit - the biggest hoist since the l-a-w cuts were abolished after the 1993 election. What I call on the Australian Labor Party to do is to say quite unequivocally that the family tax benefit increase of $600 per annum per child will stay, that nobody will lose any entitlement and that the income tax cuts, first and second round, will stay and nobody will have a tax rise.We have heard from the shadow Assistant Treasurer and we have heard the weak denials from the Leader of the Opposition, but even better was the Australian Financial Review on Friday, which finished the week by saying: `ALP in a muddle over family payment'. Who did it quote in this but the shadow finance spokesman, the member for Fraser, Mr McMuddle himself, who apparently on his way out of a press conference at the National Press Club was asked by journalists whether Labor was planning to honour the family tax payments up until 2004 or afterwards - listen to this - and he said:'We commit to the family tax benefit until 2004-05,'That is the next year. He went on to state:'They will get the two $600 payments - that is, the one before 30 January and the one next year - but after that they will have a choice of our alternative package.'I think it is quite clear: the Labor Party will not guarantee these family tax payments; the Labor Party is holding out the right to take them away if it is elected. The Labor Party will not guarantee these tax changes; the Australian Labor Party reserves the right to take away those tax cuts and to increase taxes if it is elected at the next election. The family benefits and the tax cuts in this election can be guaranteed only if the coalition is re-elected, and the families of Australia need to know that. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the opportunity to again answer about the government's $600 per annum per child increase in the family tax benefit. I have already gone through the increases in the amounts: the maximum amount increases from $3,401 to $4,001 and the minimum from $1,095 to $1,695. These benefits are income tested and, if I could inform the House where the income tests actually cut in, you are entitled to get the minimum payment with one child up to $87,702 per annum, you are entitled to get the minimum payment with two children up to $96,637 and you are entitled to get the minimum payment with three children up to $105,572. That is a very generous income threshold.If, upon reconciliation, a family for whatever reason has been overpaid its entitlements, that money is returned to the government, just as was the case under the Australian Labor Party. Under the Australian Labor Party, if you were overpaid your family benefit, on reconciliation you had to repay it. But we have introduced one change, and it is this: if upon reconciliation you have been underpaid, the government actually tops up the difference - a situation which did not prevail under the Australian Labor Party. So the Australian Labor Party only had reconciliation one way: if there was an overpayment you had to give it back, but if there was an underpayment you did not get a top-up.That situation has been in place for a very long period of time and, as far as the taxpayers of Australia are concerned, and in my view and in the view of the government, if somebody is overpaid by the government then in the interests of all taxpayers the overpayment should be recovered, and it is recovered interest free. - In addition to that, as the member for Ballarat would know, with the government having increased the amounts by $600, if people have an overpayment then they have an additional $600 to cover the overpayment. If they are underpaid, they get the top-up to their entitlement plus the $600. That is, everybody is entitled to an additional $600. You do not have to believe my word on it, because I will table the Financial Review -  - The member for Hotham says that we do not. Perhaps he will believe the word of the member for Fraser, because I will table the article in the Financial Review of Friday, 21 May 2004 headed `ALP in a muddle over family payment' that quotes the member for Fraser saying that families will get the two $600 payments. They did not seem to be running the line last Friday that families were not entitled to an additional $600 because the member for Fraser said, `They will get the two $600 payments'. I table that cutting. The point I make is this: it is a change of tactics. Last Friday the Australian Labor Party were out there guaranteeing the two payments; by Monday the Australian Labor Party have changed their tactics to try to pretend that there are no payments. The amounts have gone up by $600, the scheme gives every family an additional entitlement and the income thresholds have been lifted and the tapers have been lifted. The only way you can guarantee to keep those family tax benefits is with the return of a coalition government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for the question. For all the professed concern through interjections coming from the Labor Party, it has never been worth your while asking a question about it, apparently. Members will recall that two Australians, David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib, have been detained in Guantanamo Bay as a result of their involvement with al-Qaeda. As the House knows, both men trained with al-Qaeda, the world's most evil terrorist organisation -  - It is an organisation which trains people to kill innocent civilians. Despite the known terrorist background of these two people, the government has taken all possible steps to ensure their welfare in response to allegations that have been made by their lawyers. Ambassador Thawley has sought and received assurances, including from the Deputy Defence Secretary, the Deputy Secretary of State and the National Security Adviser, that Hicks and Habib have been treated humanely in Guantanamo Bay. Ambassador Thawley has also written to the American government seeking an official investigation into the treatment of Hicks and Habib throughout their time in United States custody. That, of course, includes the period before they were in Guantanamo Bay.Our consul-general in Washington visited Hicks and Habib 10 days ago. He also spoke to the camp commander to ensure that they are being treated humanely. Officials have now visited Hicks on nine occasions and Habib on eight occasions to check on their welfare. In both cases, they have access to medical facilities and their health is assessed regularly. I add that the secretary of my department, Ashton Calvert, also raised these issues with authorities in Washington when he was there with the Minister for Trade at the time of the signing of the free trade agreement with the United States.I appreciate that - if not in the parliament - in the media the opposition, as well as Senator Brown, are now concerning themselves with the welfare of these two Australians, who are detained because of their involvement with al-Qaeda. But I must say that it is curious that they show a greater interest in these two than the other 214 Australians who are in prison for one reason or another overseas. They are in prison from El Salvador to Kazakhstan to Nigeria - apparently they are of no interest to the Australian Labor Party at all. The only ones who are of interest are Hicks and Habib.  - As I was saying, they seem to be unconcerned about the 214 other Australians detained for any manner of reasons but, as you would expect from a party which has become deeply anti-American, they are concerned about two Australians who are detained by the Americans. I do not think the Labor Party has any interest in the other 214 Australians imprisoned.Let me conclude by saying that the government believes that both Hicks and Habib should be brought to justice through a military commission process. That is the best way to do it in the circumstances, given the state of Australian law at the time they were training with al-Qaeda. As members may or may not know, the plea bargaining process for Hicks is under way. Apparently, the opposition leader, according to interviews he has been doing recently, believes that both Hicks and Habib should be returned to Australia where, as we have explained on a number of occasions, they would be unable to face charges and would simply be released into the community. - The Leader of the Opposition, thinking that might be a bit of a political problem for him, has come up with another idea: to introduce retrospective criminal legislation. That is pretty unusual in this country - retrospective legislation in relation to the criminal offence of participating with a terrorist organisation. That, apparently, is the position of the opposition. The position of the government is that these people will go before military commissions as a result of their participation or training with al-Qaeda. We hope that they can be expedited and the matter can be dealt with through that process.</DOC>

 - I -  - Mr Speaker, I thank you for that ruling. I point out that family tax benefits are administered both by the Department of Family and Community Services and by the Australian Taxation Office, depending on whether or not you claim them through the tax system or you take them as a fortnightly payment. The answer is that every family receives an additional $600 per child per annum, subject to the income test which, as I have already outlined to the House, for three children is over $100,000. This does not change the situation - as has always been the case under the Australian Labor Party - that, where somebody has been overpaid, the government seeks the return of that overpayment.This announcement has been entirely clear from the outset. I refer to both the budget speech and to budget measures page 9, where the government says this:The lump sum will be paid to families as part of the reconciliation of FTB entitlement that normally takes place after families lodge their tax returns. -  - No, it was actually in the budget speech and it is the first measure in the document that was brought down as budget measures. You do have to actually get to page 9 of the budget to find it. It says:If required, any family assistance overpayments received by the family will be offset against the lump-sum payment, with the remainder payable to the family. Around 2 million families eligible ... under the current arrangements will receive the full lump sum. In addition, a small number of new families at the top end of the income limit will be eligible for a lump sum.That has been the position, as explained in the budget, all the way through. If I could take an analogy in relation to income tax cuts, we cut income tax rates on budget night as well. Every person who comes within those thresholds will be entitled to an income tax cut. If somebody has not had the correct income tax withholding taken out of their salaries, notwithstanding the income tax cut, upon reconciliation they will still have to make it up. It does not mean that they did not receive an income tax cut. They received the income tax cut but upon reconciliation, as is the case in relation to all government entitlements, if the withholding payments have not been great enough, you have to have a makeup. If the withholding payments have been too great in relation to an employee's tax entitlement, then you get a refund. But, whichever way, you get the benefit of the income tax cut.It is the same in the administration of family tax benefits: that people who have been underpaid get the underpayment and the entitlement to the additional $600; those who have overpayments have the entitlement to the additional $600 but have to settle up in relation to those overpayments. I also point out that this is interest free. It is the same situation as applied under the Australian Labor Party with one exception: the Australian Labor Party never made up for underpayments; they only recovered in relation to overpayments.</DOC>

 - It is a great relief to finally get the call, if I may say so. I thank the honourable member for Macarthur for his question. The government's budget which was brought down last Tuesday week maintains the budget in surplus for a seventh time under the coalition government, contrasting with Labor's five budget deficits before it was thrown out of office and the famous $10.3 billion deficit in the last year of the Keating government. In addition to that, this government has now in net terms repaid $70 billion of Labor's $96 billion debt. It continues the strong economic management which has been put in place in recent times. As a result of strong economic management, our government is now paying $6 billion less in interest payments - a built-in saving to the budget which can be used to deliver better services and lower taxes.I have been interested recently, however, to see that under its policy the Australian Labor Party is apparently promising tax cuts to everybody. The Leader of the Opposition has been saying that he does not think these tax cuts are enough and that there should be tax cuts for everybody. We all waited with bated breath for his budget reply to hear the thresholds and the amounts - how much it would cost and where he would get the money from. I must say it was a rather disappointing budget reply. It promised so much but delivered so little. Since that time, he has been consistently telling the press that he can fund his income tax cuts for everybody with savings. For example, he was asked at a press conference on 13 May 2004 this question:How can you offer low-income workers a reasonable tax cut without either sending the budget into deficit or heavily eating into existing Government programs?Answer:By continuing down the path on which we have been embarked since the last federal election ... eliminating Government waste and mismanagement. We have identified over $8 billion worth of savings ...This is the mantra: we have got $8 billion worth of savings for our tax cuts, so the Leader of the Opposition says. Getting hold of this savings list is harder than finding a sighting of the member for Hotham. It is very hard to sight the member for Hotham. It is even harder to get hold of this savings list, including the ridiculous situation where the Leader of the Opposition went on the Alan Jones program and when he was asked he said, `I have the list in front of me but I am not giving it out.' He said, `I have this $8 billion of savings right in front of me.'We do owe something to the Sunday Age,which on Sunday managed to get hold of this list. As it turns out, this list does not have $8 billion worth of savings - it has $7 billion worth of savings. A billion here or a billion there never worried the Labor Party in the past. But the interesting thing about this $7 billion of so-called savings is that every last dollar of it and more has already been spent. The savings, for example, are opposing the government's MedicarePlus program and redirecting the funding to Labor's health policy. Labor is opposing the government's higher education package and redirecting the funds to what it says it will invest in higher education. It includes an increase in the diesel fuel rebate and a new payroll tax, but it does not include any net available savings which can fund tax cuts. Whether the Leader of the Opposition understands this point or not, the member for Fraser most certainly does, because here is what he is quoted as saying in the Sunday Age: Mr McMullan said none of the $7 billion would be available to pay for Labor's yet to be announced tax and family benefit changes. 'We have to find other savings, essentially to cover it,' he said. 'We have been working on a list of savings to cover that contingency.Do you notice how Labor's tax cuts have now been relegated to the issue of a contingency? There were going to be tax cuts on Thursday. Now we are talking about a contingency - a contingency for which Labor has not identified a single dollar. The next time the Leader of the Opposition gets into a press conference and says he has $8 billion of savings, the comments of the member for Fraser ought to come right back at him. You have $7 billion, and you have already spent $9 billion. You do not have a single dollar of tax cuts. - The member for Fraser just interjected by saying, `That's not true,' - I will quote the Sunday Age. It quotes Mr McMullan: 'We have to find other savings, essentially to cover it,' he said. 'We have been working on a list of savings to cover that contingency.As the Sunday Age said, none of the $7 billion would be available to pay for Labor's tax or family benefits. I will rely on the Sunday Age and the statement from the member for Fraser.The reality is this: the Leader of the Opposition is trumpeting $8 billion of savings. They do not exist because he has spent them and more so. The Australian Labor Party is promising tax cuts to everybody, but it does not have a single dollar to pay for them. If Labor could find a single dollar, it would be used to pay for additional spending promises not for tax reductions. The Leader of the Opposition has been trying to skate through, promising everything to everybody. The time has come for scrutiny in relation to his claims. His claims do not add up, and we saw this extraordinary statement from the Australian Labor Party on the weekend that it is not going to list its savings because the government might pinch them. Let me say why the Labor Party is not going to list its savings: they do not exist. Labor has been running around promising tax cuts to everybody without the wherewithal to announce them because it cannot fund them. It does not have the savings. It is an empty promise. It is a waffle. It is a Leader of the Opposition who deserves some scrutiny.</DOC>

 - This question arises from an indication the government gave yesterday that it would tighten the rules in relation to the entitlements of people to accompany members of parliament on study trips overseas. We all know that has arisen from the publicity given to the trip that was carried out by the member for Makin, completely in accordance with the rules. Can I say that in the time that I have been in the parliament I have met a lot of members of parliament on both sides who have worked very hard for their electorates. I have not met anybody who has worked harder for her electorate than does the current member for Makin. This particular issue has been attended with the usual sorts of declarations from the Labor Party, `We're not going to talk about this,' but we have the Leader of the Opposition kicking the issue along. We have said that we are going to tighten the rules, and when we have finished that consideration we will announce the result of that. Can I just say this to the Leader of the Opposition: perhaps he might encourage any members of his party whose circumstances were analogous to those of the member for Makin to do what she has done and offer to repay the money. </DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Grey for his question. Of course, the member for Grey is well aware of many of his constituents who will receive and have accrued to them many benefits from the free trade agreement, which I signed on behalf of Australia last week in Washington. After we concluded the negotiations earlier in the year, I visited the electorate of Grey with the member and we went to the Port Lincoln tuna processing plant there. The manager of that plant was very supportive of the outcome of the deal, given that their product can enter the United States tariff free from 1 January 2005. I would just like to quote from a press release that the General Manager of Port Lincoln Tuna Processors, Mr Lindsay Guillot, put out at the time. He said:We now employ 250 people, but that number looks set to increase by 70 in the first year and then the sky's the limit. Regional South Australia can't afford for the agreement to become a political football. It puts at risk jobs, families and the future of an industry trying to improve its global competitiveness.There is one industry in South Australia that is just sitting and waiting for the implementation of the free trade agreement and the benefits that will accrue next year. South Australia and, I might add, all the states and the Labor state governments across Australia have indicated their support to me for the free trade agreement. We had a meeting of ministers in Tasmania a few weeks ago and they are all quite enthusiastic about 1 January arriving next year, when their industries can take advantage of the access to the United States market. South Australia is right at the front of the queue. South Australia's No. 1 export destination just happens to be the United States of America. South Australia exported $1.4 billion worth of exports to the United States in 2003 - 17 per cent of their exports. South Australia's two major exports are wine and passenger motor vehicles. What are two of the sectors that are going to benefit the most from the free trade agreement? They are wine and the passenger motor vehicle industry. Under the US FTA, tariffs on wine will be reduced to zero. Under the US FTA, tariffs on autos will be reduced to zero. The automotive sector and the wine sector can add a lot of value to what has already been achieved under the leadership of our government. We know that since 1996 the Australian automotive industry has gone from negligible exports of fully built-up motor cars to $5 billion worth of motor cars. That industry has done extremely well over the last eight years, and that message should not be lost on some of the commentators from the Labor movement who rail against the government and some of our policies in the industrial manufacturing sector in Australia. The FTA is a perfect case of engaging and opening up markets across the world and giving them the opportunity to participate. As I have said, the South Australian government is one of a number of Labor state governments across Australia who are supporting this agreement, supporting our government, in pursuit of the implementation of this. In fact, the South Australian state government wrote to me recently, commending the agreement. The letter says: `I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate you and your officials on your effort; I have no doubt the task was immense.' The task was immense, and we still have an immense task in front of us convincing the naysayers opposite - those who are opposed to this agreement for opposition's sake, who will not see the benefits of this agreement to Australian producers and manufacturers and exporters, who want to stand in the way of more jobs and more opportunities in South Australia - and that is the Australian Labor Party. Latham Labor is still saying that it might block the agreement. We would ask it to be cognisant of what its state Labor government colleagues have said, what industries in South Australia have said - the auto industry, the wine industry and the Port Lincoln tuna processing industry: do not make this a political football; get in and support it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson for her question. I note her very real interest in this and, along with the members for Richmond and Moncrieff, her real efforts to try to find a resolution to a problem that should never have arisen. This was an instance of the very great generosity of the Australian government. We stepped in to help the people of south-east Queensland and north-east New South Wales with a real problem with roads congestion. - They are quite clearly state roads. The Tugun bypass is really the responsibility of the Queensland government. But, recognising the difficulties that the people in that area face -  - Recognising the difficulties faced by people in those parts of the world, we said that we would contribute around half - a capped amount of $120 million - to resolve the problem. This was gratefully accepted some 12 months or so ago, by the then Queensland minister for roads, with the clear understanding that there would be no further call on the Commonwealth. The only problem was that the bypass effectively involved a little bit of road building on the New South Wales side of the border. As only the New South Wales minister for roads can do, he said, `Oh, no; the $120 million really came out of New South Wales' allocation, so we will not approve it.' When we said, `No, it does not come out of that,' and convinced him of that, he said, `Oh, but there are environmental problems.'On the face of this, on the last day or two of the Queensland state election campaign, Mr Beattie - without any consultation with us - decided that he would build a completely new road that was not a bypass at all. When we said, `No, that would not work,' and the local residents said that it would not work, do you know what Mr Beattie proposed? He proposed that the Commonwealth, with some imaginary powers, should annex a part of New South Wales and add it to Queensland. When we said, `No, we will not do that,' he said that we were contemptible for not resolving their roads problem. I ask, rhetorically: had it been proposed the other way around, by New South Wales, that we annex a bit of the Gold Coast and add it to New South Wales, how would Mr Beattie have reacted?Senator Ian Campbell and I had the `temerity' to suggest that we were very interested in the next stage of the Pacific Highway upgrade. We have had a 10-year program and we have put $600 million into upgrading the Pacific Highway. We have gone from nine per cent dual carriageway to 33 per cent - and do you know that that effort was described today by the New South Wales roads minister as a `paltry and piddly amount'? Can you believe that? Why would he have done that? He did it because it was suggested that his backflip - in agreeing at one o'clock today to build the very bypass that the people up there need - was driven by wanting to secure some more money from the Commonwealth for the next stage of the Pacific Highway upgrade. He said that was contemptible. I do not think it is contemptible at all; I think it is reality.It was plainly the case that the Australian government could not justify further expenditure on that road while there was a bottleneck - presided over disgracefully by two state premiers who could not get on the phone and resolve what was a state problem. They plainly saw the light. I can say one thing about these two hard-headed ministers: when I banged their heads together hard enough, they actually came up with a solution. -  - Yes, it was a loud noise. They said, `Yes, we want the money. Yes, we need the Commonwealth involved. We'll roll over and do what we should have done from day one,' and that is to build the Tugun with a very generous contribution from the Australian government for a state road, to the great advantage of the constituents of the members for Moncrieff, McPherson and Richmond.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fraser for his question. I think the member for Fraser knows what my answer will be, but let me just repeat it in case he does not. I will be privileged to remain the leader of the Liberal Party of the Australia, which I have had the immense pleasure of leading since January 1995 and, previous to that, over a perhaps more chequered period in the party's history. I will continue to lead the party for as long as the party wishes me to and it is in the party's best interests that I should do so. I thank the member for Fraser for giving me the opportunity.But while I am on my feet, I cannot resist the temptation - and for this I have to blame, or thank, depending on your point of view, the member for Fraser - to think a little about the sort of choice that is faced by the Australian people in the months ahead. It could be months with a capital `m', months with a small `m' or perhaps months with a middle-sized `m'; you could take whatever interpretation you like. I point out to the member for Fraser that the next election, amongst other things, will be a choice that the Australian people will make between a coalition led by me, and ably deputy led by the member for Gwydir, in charge of the economic management of this country, along with the member for Higgins as Treasurer.Arrayed against us will be the member for Werriwa as Leader of the Opposition and, of course, Mr Magic Pudding himself, the member for Hotham, as Treasurer. So it is a Howard-Costello economic management team versus a Latham-Crean economic management team. I come to the reason I call him Mr Magic Pudding. The Magic Pudding is a book that all of us who have read to our children are very familiar with. I listened to this man. I kid you not; I sat down in front of my television set when he was addressing the National Press Club. - I did. When he was addressing the National Press Club, I was glued to the set. I was captivated. The first thing he said was, `Labor will have bigger surpluses.' I thought, `Does he belong to the same Australian Labor Party that left us with a debt of $96 billion, which it has taken us years of struggle to get rid of?' He went on and said, `We'll give bigger tax cuts than the coalition.' He then went on to say, `Ah, but we'll spend more than the coalition.' Then to cap it all off he said, `I've got something for you that you didn't think of. We're going to have some kind of intergenerational retirement fund.' How do you fund that? Through what kind of taxation?Here you have the man who, along with the Leader of the Opposition, puts himself forward as an alternative manager of the Australian economy. With all of the record that the Australian public is aware of, the member for Hotham is saying that under Labor you will have bigger tax cuts, more spending, larger surpluses and an intergenerational fund. On top of that, we are going to maintain the same volume of economic growth. I do not think the Australian public, the more it hears about that, is going to believe it. Let me say to the member for Fraser that we will be delighted to deal with these issues on a very regular basis. We will be delighted to parade the virtues of the former mayor of Liverpool and Mr Magic Pudding before the Australian public month after month. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. I know how hard he works to try to ensure that the people of Dobell have access to the best quality health care system. There is quite a bit of a blame game that goes on sometimes. There is a fair bit of argy-bargy between federal and state governments on health issues. But behind the scenes there is also a great deal of practical cooperation to solve the real problems that people face.This is a problem for our public hospitals. They often have people who are not well enough to go home but who are not really sick enough to justify taking up an acute bed at the cost of some $500 a day. Last year the government allocated some $250 million to help the states to build new and upgraded convalescent and rehabilitation facilities for people leaving hospital but not ready to go home. Yesterday I announced, along with the New South Wales health minister, $86 million in federal money to help New South Wales provide new and upgraded facilities for rehabilitation and convalescence.This money includes a new rehabilitation therapy centre at the Mount Druitt Hospital. It includes a new convalescent centre at Westmead. It includes a significant number of new step-down beds at hospitals around New South Wales, including Nepean, Woy Woy in the electorate of Dobell, Concord, Liverpool, Royal North Shore, Prince of Wales, Balmain, Hornsby, Ryde, Bankstown, Berri, Cowra, Lithgow, Parkes and Forbes. All of these hospitals will benefit thanks to the Pathways Home program of the federal government, announced yesterday in conjunction with New South Wales.Yesterday's announcement follows more than $100 million earlier allocated to Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, as well as the territories. What it demonstrates is the Howard government's ability to work cooperatively and constructively with the states for a good cause, and that good cause is the delivery of better health care to Australians in need.</DOC>

 - Let me re-echo the words the Prime Minister has said. Whilst my colleagues want me and whilst it is in the interests of the party, I would be very happy to continue. But I am rather amused by the Australian Labor Party asking us to guarantee we will stay on and run again. We used to be in opposition and when we were we would ask questions of the then Labor Party. We would not ask them to guarantee that they would stay on; we would ask them to guarantee that they would go. We would say to the then Labor Prime Minister, `Will you guarantee you will go?' and to the then Treasurer Keating, `Will you guarantee you will go?' We are rather flattered by all of this interest that the Labor Party shows in our careers. There are times when I think to myself, `Can one do more as Treasurer?' You know what always comes home to me? What comes home to me is this: that I stand between the Treasurership and the member for Hotham. Whenever I need incentive, boy, that gets me going! </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for the question. He is aware that the Australian government is really delivering for farmers. In this budget there was another significant commitment of resources to the rural sector. The National Farmers Federation and other industry organisations have welcomed the budget and the contribution that it will make to the farm sector.There is more money for Farm Help, for FarmBis and for the rural financial counsellors and record expenditure for the NHT and the national action plan. There is a four-year commitment to Land Care, more money for the Murray-Darling Basin and nearly $90 million to patrol the southern waters for illegal fishing. There is more money for the Great Artesian Basin and money to prepare for biosecurity threats and to improve the livestock export trade and there is more money for border protection at our airports. And of course there are significant tax cuts for wine producers. There is also the sugar package and drought assistance and the like. It is a budget that provides a very significant commitment to the rural sector.But I can understand why the member for Maranoa asked whether there were any alternative policies and whether there is any alternative vision. In 4,050 words in his budget reply speech the Leader of the Opposition did not mention farmers or drought or rural issues once. Not a single mention was made of drought, even though it is obviously a key factor in assessing our nation's economic capacity. There was no reference to farmers and the enormous contribution they make to their nation. In addition, he did not even take the opportunity to retract his venomous anti-farmer statements that have been so notorious over the years - his writings in the SydneyDaily Telegraph and other newspapers. In fact, there was nothing from the Leader of the Opposition in relation to what he might do for the rural sector.The Treasurer referred earlier to the fact that the list of cuts has been hidden. It is no longer available. But the Melbourne Age, it seems, have managed to produce their own list and have a series of things on their list of cuts. We have already had the member for Fraser and the member for Corio confirm that the Bureau of Rural Resources is on the Labor Party's hit list and also that they are going to slash funding for ABARE. These are key bodies which provide advice and assistance and which assess applications in relation to drought matters. It is a matter of serious concern that the Leader of the Opposition is going to slash the support that is necessary to deal with these key drought policy issues. Indeed, he actually has thrown a question mark over the whole continuation of drought policy and drought assistance altogether, because on 30 April 2004 on the ABC in south-east New South Wales he questioned the provision of drought assistance during the recovery phase after a drought. He must be the only one around - being a city-centric Western Suburbs leader - who does not appreciate how important it is to provide support for farmers during that recovery year when they need support to plant their crops and to restock. He has ruled out assistance during that period. This seems to be exactly the same theme that Labor have adopted in each of the states. As soon as they are elected, the drought is over and that is the end of the assistance.Now we have a Leader of the Opposition who not only cannot bring himself to refer to farmers in his response statement but who also leaves the axe hanging over some of these vital programs. The opposition leader has promised to cut 13 government programs if he is elected. How many of those are in the rural sector? We already know BRS is going. ABARE is going to be cut. Drought assistance is now threatened. And he has given a big long list of other things that he does not like, like the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, FarmBis, land care expenses, tax concessions, zone tax rebate, income tax averaging and the like. The reality is that this is the government that delivers for the rural sector. Labor will cut programs in agriculture and farmers will once again have to endure the wrath of Labor in government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. There were 52 applicants for this round of CRC funding. At stage 1, 19 were unsuccessful and 33 have proceeded. Of the 19, four were existing CRCs, not all 19. The other 15 were applicants only. So the four existing CRCs that have not proceeded still have two years funding to remain, on average about $6 million each. From the start I have said that I will assist them. They will look at other sources of funding. They may look to the CRC program for reprofiling to put them in a position to compete for the 2006 round. For the environmental CRCs there is an opportunity to go to state or federal departments and other programs under BAA.Under the CRC program and under the guidelines that this government has adopted it is final. We will not intervene under the CRC program. We will champion any of those unsuccessful applicants in other forums and under other programs, and that is what the honourable members for Herbert and Leichhardt are doing - unlike the Labor Party, who want to junk the probity lawyers, want to junk all of the certainty associated with this round of CRCs, and help their mates. They have named four CRCs that they will fund. Under the CRC program, they will fund four unsuccessful applicants - or thereabouts. What about those who miss out? Of those 52 applicants, what do you say to the approximately 40 who will eventually not receive funding? Who are you going to take the money off? We have probity lawyers all the way through. You are entitled to have a public debate.  - The member and the Labor Party are entitled to have a public debate and engage us on the criteria. But the idea that you would favour certain applicants over others is, I believe, utterly improper.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question. I am happy to inform the member for Cook and the House that the federal government has just announced an $80 million investment in Australia's security through the training facilities for Australia's special forces, which are to be completed in Holsworthy in 2006.These new facilities, which will be located in the west of Sydney in Holsworthy, will include indoor and outdoor multilevel electronic and live firing ranges as well as a variety of training and targeting environments for the Tactical Assault Group, East. These new ranges will depict both an urban environment, which is a likely scenario for these troops to be committed to, and also an aircraft, which is another likely scenario. For the first time, our troops will be able in the east of this country to have live firing exercises, where they can fire in a 360 degree arc of fire, which of course is the most realistic sort of training that they could undertake.This is why our troops acquit themselves so well when they are engaged in operations, because this government commits the resources that are required to doctrine, to training and to equipment. In addition to training facilities, the coalition is providing new assault rifles, machine guns, antitank weapons, mortars, grenade launchers, vehicles, optical equipment such as binoculars, thermal imaging equipment and night vision goggles as well as new communications and radio equipment. This builds on the $1.3 billion that the federal government has committed since 11 September 2001 to making Australia a more secure environment for this generation and the generations to come.</DOC>

 - I genuinely thank the Leader of the Opposition. I really mean it. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to have a debate about youth unemployment - if he wants to compare the record of his government and, indeed, the appalling record of his two great heroes, Gough Whitlam and Paul Keating, when it comes to youth unemployment - I am perfectly happy to do so.Let me start my answer by saying that the level of youth unemployment in Australia now is dramatically lower than it was when we came to office. The level of general unemployment in this country is dramatically lower than it was when we came to office. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that teenage full-time unemployment was 26.8 per cent when Labor left office. It had peaked at 34.5 per cent in July 1992. The teenage full-time unemployment to population ratio reached 10.1 in July 1992. The teenage full-time unemployment rate was 20.6 per cent in April 2004. The full-time unemployment to population ratio for teenagers is now 4.8 per cent, which is less than half what it was under Labor, less than half of the legacy that the Labor Party left us with.The Leader of the Opposition invites me to join Labor in adopting the youth guarantee policy. Let me tell you I have no intention of joining Labor on the youth guarantee policy, because it is a bad, inadequate, weak policy. To start with, the youth guarantee would only be phased in from 2006. It would not come into full effect until 2009. It is now, for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, 2004. In the meantime, under that policy all that would be provided for teenage job seekers would be 13,000 intensive training places under a so-called link-up program - 8,000 places in 2005 and 5,000 in 2006. This assistance would amount to little more than a two-week training course. It is only a fraction of the assistance that disadvantaged teenage job seekers already receive under the Job Network. This year no fewer than 31,000 teenage job seekers will be assessed as highly disadvantaged, and every one of that 31,000 - not 5,000 or 8,000 - will be eligible for access to the highest level of support, no matter where they live. In summary, Labor's plan is confused and confusing. But it is not really Labor's plan after all. It is certainly not the plan of Latham Labor. It is certainly not the plan of the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa. Some people have been unkind enough to say that the Leader of the Opposition pinched it from them. Some have said that he plagiarised it. Bruno Bouchet - Honourable members - Bruno! - Oh, they know Bruno. Perhaps he leaked it to them. They know Bruno. What he said at the national youth parliament - listen to this - Honourable members - The youth parliament. - We are up here wearing our heart on our sleeve about the young of Australia, but we are deriding what is said at a youth parliament! This is what he had to say:... the purpose of this bill is to ensure that young people are either learning or earning ...Where did you hear that before? From Bruno: ... learning or earning in the workforce, not simply doing nothing.Bruno said:We went to Canberra to give them our ideas and we deserved to get credit for that ...I think that is right. Just as Bill Clinton should have got the credit, so should Bruno. He said that would be `the right thing to do'. Remember that slogan? I think it may have been attributed to a New South Wales Labor government - I had better be careful on these attributions - of which the member for Kingsford Smith was a member. I think the late Paul Landa may have been responsible for the program that had the title `Do the right thing'. You should do the right thing when you pinch somebody's policy; you ought to do the right thing and you ought to give them credit for it. In the Sydney Morning Herald of 18 May, Bruno Bouchet said, `Latham accused of stealing ideas again ...' But it is also interesting that the plagiarism did not stop with Bruno. In November 2002 Premier Beattie's education reforms aimed to ensure that young people would be `earning or learning'. This has quite an ancestry. He is still in office. But let me give you one who is no longer in office. A former Victorian Labor Premier, John Cain, used the description `youth guarantee' for an education program in 1988.All I can say to the Leader of the Opposition is that when Labor were last in office they failed the young of Australia when it came to giving them employment. Based on the Leader of the Opposition's youth guarantee, if Labor were ever in office again, they would again be monumental failures so far as caring and delivering for the young work force of Australia is concerned. This government has a proud record of having slashed youth unemployment. We have driven unemployment down to a level that has not been seen for a generation, and it is one of the government's proudest achievements.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for that question. As the House is aware, I will be visiting next week the United States and after that going on to the United Kingdom and briefly to France to join the 60th anniversary celebrations of the D-Day landing. When in Washington, as well as meeting President Bush and other members of the administration, I will have the opportunity -   -  - As well as conferring with President Bush and other members of the administration, I would hope to have a wide range of political contacts. I will also have the opportunity of meeting senior Republican and Democrat senators, congressmen and key business leaders to further advance the case for the American Congress to ratify the free trade agreement. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition is nodding. I hope that connotes that the Labor Party may be moving towards supporting the free trade agreement. In addition to those discussions in Washington, I will on the way over to Washington call on the Governor of California. - I will be accompanied by Mr Don Argus, who is the Chairman of BHP Billiton. The purpose of this call is to join BHP Billiton - and I will be accompanied, as I said, by Mr Argus and senior executives of the company - to lobby for the company's bid to develop an offshore terminal to permit Australian LNG to be supplied to southern California.This terminal in itself, and its associated upstream facilities, is a project that is worth several billion dollars. If this project can be won for Australia, it will be an enormous additional export victory for this country and it will add increasingly to the export earnings of the natural gas and resource sector. The terminal in itself, with its associated upstream facilities, is a project worth several billion dollars. The associated gas supply from the gas fields off the Western Australian coast would last over several decades and would be worth billions of dollars more to the Australian economy. The value of these deals to the Australian economy, if they can be achieved, would be worth about $15 billion.As the House is aware - certainly those on this side of the House are aware - when it comes to winning many of these major resource contracts, cooperative effort between the government and business leaders is necessary. Just as the involvement of senior members of the government was instrumental in winning the LNG contract with Guangdong province in China, so it is that the association of the government with BHP Billiton's effort - and there are quite a number of competitors and the company has no more than an even money chance of winning the contract - is important. It is important that the voice of the government be the same as the voice of BHP Billiton. I will be promoting the Australian national interest. I would have thought that the purpose of prime ministers going overseas was to promote the national interest of the country.I also would have thought that it would have been in the national interest of this country for the alternative Prime Minister to feel able to visit Washington. But apparently the alternative Prime Minister of this country felt unable to visit Washington because he would not receive much of a welcome. That is a matter that the alternative Prime Minister of Australia will have to deal with. But, as for the rather phoney excuse that we were about to have an election, as I have said on numerous occasions, I can promise the Leader of the Opposition that we are not going to have an election in June. I will be looking after the interests of Australian companies and the Australian national interest. After visiting Washington I will, as I said, have a meeting with the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, in London and then attend the commemorative celebrations for the D-Day landing in France the next day.While I am on my feet could I just say that, inevitably, the issue of Iraq will come up during the time that I will be in Washington. Can I take this opportunity of welcoming the speech that was made by President Bush earlier today, setting out in greater detail the goals of the United States and the coalition in relation to Iraq. I take this opportunity of repeating - particularly in the context of some opinion polls that reflect current Australian opinion on our participation in Iraq - that this government has absolutely no intention of altering its position in relation to being part of the coalition in Iraq. We did not enter the coalition on the basis of opinion polls last year and we have absolutely no intention, on the basis of opinion polls, of altering our position at the present time.I would remind the House and, through the House, I would remind the Australian people that the policy of the Labor Party is not that Australia should leave Iraq in December; the policy of the Labor Party is that Australia should leave Iraq immediately after 30 June. In the current context of what is occurring in Iraq, nothing could be more calculated to encourage anarchy and further bloodshed. What Iraq needs after the handover of sovereignty is the continued presence, at the request and with the consent of the Iraqi people, of international forces.However much the Leader of the Opposition may argue, `We're effectively arguing for troops to come out by December' - because that is based on his not unreasonable calculation that he cannot pull them out unless there is a change of government and, for practical purposes, that would not be until December of this year at the earliest - it is very interesting, when you analyse what he said and what the member for Griffith has said, that what they are advocating as a matter of policy is that we should go after the handover. I cannot imagine anything which is more irresponsible and more calculated. If that advice were taken by others, I think that would condemn Iraq to a very, very dangerous future.So let me take the opportunity of saying to the House again that this government did not decide that Australia should join the coalition of the willing as a result of an opinion poll and, equally, we have no intention of changing our position on the basis of an opinion poll.</DOC>

 - I am not aware of what has been said at the Leader of the Opposition's community forums, but I am aware of what has been said to me as I move around different electorates in Australia, particularly in Sydney recently - and that is that working people are very cranky with Labor governments for jacking up TAFE fees. That is what I get from people when I go to the western suburbs of Sydney. So the last bloke who can come into this House and start wringing his hands about TAFE fees is a member of the Australian Labor Party. Some of the increases by Labor governments have been 300 per cent and 400 per cent in outrageous charges for TAFE fees. If the Leader of the Opposition had any genuine commitment - as opposed to some kind of rhetorical flourish with a stolen description which is the product of somebody else's idea - he would prevail upon Bob Carr and all those other people who are his friends in the New South Wales Labor Party to do something about the outrageous increases.While I am on my feet, I will add to what I said in the earlier answer in relation to youth unemployment. In his budget reply speech a couple of weeks ago, the Leader of the Opposition said - and I think he repeated it today, or words very similar to it:In some communities, the problem is critical: youth unemployment rates of more than 30 per cent in places like Wollongong, the northern suburbs of Adelaide and Wide Bay in Queensland.Bear in mind that he made this remark in a nationally televised speech. It was his formal reply to the budget, so it was not an off-the-cuff remark on a radio program, safe in the knowledge that the transcript would not be put out, so nobody might pick it up. I specifically point out to the Leader of the Opposition that, since 1996, in the Wide Bay region the rate has fallen by almost 10 per cent to 18.9 per cent. This was a budget reply. This was not a community forum where you think you can get away with anything; this was a budget reply to a television audience of several hundred thousand Australians waiting to hear the alternative economic policy - and they got a downright misrepresentation from the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. The Australian government welcomes the draft resolution which was tabled by the British and American governments in the United Nations Security Council yesterday. This resolution is a very important component of the end of the occupation of Iraq by the Coalition Provisional Authority. It will deliver authority to a sovereign, interim government in Iraq by 30 June. The draft resolution endorses a timetable for Iraq's transition to democracy, as agreed by the Iraqi governing council back in March this year, and also provides for elections in January 2005. It calls for significant United Nations support for the process and recognises the continuing security challenges in Iraq. Importantly, the draft Security Council resolution reaffirms the mandate of the multinational force in Iraq for a further 12 months and calls for contributions to that multinational force.I think a lot of the debate here in Australia about this issue will be influenced by the fact that the Security Council will now be considering these issues. If the United Nations Security Council endorses the continuation of a multinational force in Iraq, then it would be a strange thing for Australia to suddenly withdraw from that force endorsed by the United Nations Security Council. Significant progress has already been made in the international community's plan for the transition of sovereignty in Iraq, and Australia has played its part in that. Twelve ministries have been set up and their authority has been handed to the Iraqis. Importantly, the Australian government has played a significant role in helping to rehabilitate the Iraqi agriculture ministry, and that has now been transferred to the Iraqis. The Australian Defence Force is doing a good job with the training of the Iraqi army and is helping with the training of Iraq's navy. Our police will help train the Iraqi police. Australian experts are helping to strengthen Iraq's legal, financial and trading systems. The United Nations envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, is nearing the end of his consultations on the formation of an interim government. We will have to wait and see, but that announcement is expected to be made by the end of this month. I think that if we do have that Iraqi interim government, as appointed by Mr Brahimi, the United Nations expert, it will be a very significant development. June 30 will constitute the day when power is handed over to the Iraqi people. This will be a very important moment because Iraq as a country will move into an era that it has not known for a very long time. There have been 3½ decades of dictatorship, and there has been coalition control over Iraq for a bit over a year. The establishment of an interim government in Iraq will hand to Iraqis control of Iraq's ministries; it will mean that Iraqis are in control of their economic policy. Very importantly - and the Australian government strongly holds this view - Iraq's oil resources will be in the hands of Iraqi authorities, not in foreign hands. Democratic elections will then follow, as I said, in January 2005.The road ahead for Iraq is not going to be an easy one, and there is no doubt that terrorists will redouble their efforts to subvert the plans and wishes of the Iraqi people. There is absolutely no doubt about that, and we have to confront that. As an international community, we have two choices. We can either cut and run from Iraq - and the Libyan foreign minister said to me the other day that, if we were to do that, we would leave Iraq, like Somalia, in a state of anarchy - or we can work, including with the United Nations - and I am optimistic about the passage of the Security Council resolution - under the auspices of a Security Council resolution to provide stability for Iraq so that, for the first time in 3½ decades, the Iraqi people can look forward to a stable and decent government. That is something that will be very important not only for the Middle East but for the world.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question, and I pay tribute to the way in which he so well represents the electorate of Eden-Monaro. The budget introduced new benefits for Australian families. It increased the amount of the family tax benefit by $600 per annum per child. In addition to that, it changed the taper in relation to the maximum family benefit. In addition to that, it changed the income test and the taper in relation to family tax benefit B. It introduced a new maternity payment of $3,000 per child, and in addition to that it increased child-care places for those parents that want to return to work maybe on a part-time basis. There are now going to be 40,000 additional outside school hours care places and more family day care places. The effect of all of that is that 87 per cent of Australian families with children will receive benefits under the changes to the family tax benefit scheme - 87 per cent. Including tax cuts in the budget, there will be 99.8 per cent of Australian families with children which receive benefits by way of either the family tax benefit or tax cuts announced in the budget - 99.8 per cent of Australian families with children. This is of enormous benefit. If we go down some of the electorates, there are 47,000 families in the electorate of Werriwa, 99.8 per cent of them receiving benefits. In the seat of Eden-Monaro, there are 53,813 families with children, and 99.8 per cent of Australian families receive benefits - and so we could go on. The family tax benefit -  - Bendigo? Yes, the member for Bendigo asked about Bendigo: there are 48,945 families in Bendigo, and 99.8 per cent of Australian families benefit. The people of Bendigo ought to know that, if it had been for the member for Bendigo, there would have been no benefits for families in the budget. What is more, they ought to know this: if they vote for the member for Bendigo, there is no guarantee that those benefits will stay, because the Australian Labor Party reserves the right to take away the family tax benefit and the income tax cuts. So a vote for the Labor member for Bendigo is a vote against family tax benefits and tax cuts, and I hope the people of Bendigo remember that in the next election.You can claim the family tax benefit under the tax system or you can claim it as a fortnightly payment. If you claim it under the tax system, the effect of the family tax benefit means that a single income family with two children do not pay tax until their family income goes above $40,975. Let me say that again: if you claim it through the tax system, the effect is that a single income family with two children do not pay any tax in net terms until their income reaches $40,975. If you claim it through the tax system and you are a two income family with an 80-20 split and three children, the effect is that your family do not pay net income tax until the family income goes above $51,633. So for families on incomes of $40,000 and $50,000 it is much better than income splitting. In fact, they do not pay net tax with those cameos that I have previously illustrated.What do the Australian Labor Party say about all this? They say they reserve the right to take away the benefits and they reserve the right to take away the income tax cuts. They say that they are in favour of more tax cuts, but they cannot tell you what the thresholds will be, what the rates will be, when they will come into effect, how much they will cost and how they will pay for them. We have been doing some work to try to figure out what the income tax thresholds of the Labor Party would be. What would you do if you wanted to find out what the likely policy of the Australian Labor Party was?A government member - Ask the ACTU.  - No. We have been reading every State of the Union address ever delivered by Bill Clinton to try and find out what the Australian Labor Party tax thresholds are likely to be. We find out when we read these State of the Union addresses that Bill Clinton favoured much larger tax cuts for people on higher incomes. In the United States you do not start paying top marginal tax rates until well in excess of what they are in Australia. So looking for guidance from Bill Clinton is not going to justify the criticisms that the Australian Labor Party have been making in relation to this budget, nor indeed the Third Way of Mr Blair and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown.The whole of Australia has been promised by Labor that it will announce tax cuts, and Australia waits. I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition has cancelled his trip to America, allegedly to stay home for the election. But the tax policy is presumably going to be announced by the member for Hotham, and the member for Hotham has not cancelled his scheduled trip to Kenya and Zambia in view of the imminent election. In fact, some wags have suggested that the ALP has asked the member for Hotham to extend his visit to Kenya and Zambia, given the imminence of the election. The time is now and the Labor Party has made the promise. Back it up and answer this one question: where is the money coming from?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Indeed, a recent survey by Monash University has just revealed some pretty good news - that is, that the policies we have been adopting as a government to train -  - more doctors for rural service and to encourage them to move to rural areas and stay there is working very well indeed. In this budget, with an $830 million commitment, we take that further forward. The findings of the survey establish that there is a surprisingly high degree of satisfaction on the part of rural GPs with their lot in life and with their general practice in regional areas. Three-quarters of rural general practitioners, both male and female, are satisfied with rural practice. Even more are content with their life as a rural doctor. That is a very important measure and one that I think rural communities around Australia will welcome and use in their efforts to attract still more doctors back to rural and regional practice.The study found that `training programs are working'. There has been a significant increase in the number of female doctors who felt prepared for rural practice since 1996, and the doctors make it plain that it is feeling prepared for and familiar with country work that gives them the confidence to work in country areas. That feeling of being prepared has risen from 51 per cent over the last eight years to 66 per cent, and the proportion of male doctors who now feel prepared for rural practice has increased from below 70 per cent to well over 70 per cent.The Monash University study also found that the demographic profile of rural doctors is changing. In fact, compared with the national average there is a higher proportion of female doctors in the 45 to 49 age group in rural practice, and that suggests that female doctors are staying in practice longer. That is very welcome. For male doctors, compared with the national average the survey found that there are fewer rural doctors in the over-60 group and more in the under-35 group. In other words, more young male doctors are being attracted into rural practice.All of this is very encouraging and it reflects on our efforts in government to address what has been at the top of concerns for everyone on this side of the House who represents a regional area, I think it is fair to say, for the last 15 years - the shortage of doctors, specialists and allied health care workers. We set out to address that problem. The way the Leader of the Opposition talks you would think that he alone had discovered some things in life, like teenagers and fatherhood and community forums. But as one who has run community forums and participated in them in regional Australia for 15 years and does them all the time, I can tell you that, as he might not have been out there in regional Australia - I don't think he has; I do know the member for Hotham almost never goes out there - he would not be in a position to clearly identify what comes up all the time when you talk to country people and regional Australians, and there are seven million of them, about their concerns on health. There is the chronic shortage of doctors and specialists, which we are now correcting, and we have that chronic shortage in very large part because the ALP went to sleep at the wheel on this. They let the country intake of kids into our medical schools fall from around 25 per cent to five per cent, and we have got it back up to about 25 per cent. That is giving us the pool we need for the future. You can get reaction to a few things out in the bush - you really can. If you say, `If you get Mr Latham, you'd get Mr Crean running the economy,' you can see them visibly taken aback. If you want a second rise out of them, you say, `If you have Mr Latham running the place, you get not only Mr Crean but also the MUA under Martin Ferguson taking over transport again.' But if you want a complete failure to get any reaction at all - just a blank stare - you say to them, `You know, the member for Batman, Martin Ferguson, is also their spokesman for regional affairs.' They say: `Really? We didn't know they had one. We certainly haven't seen any policy direction from them.'Let me issue this one challenge to the Labor Party on regional policies: if it is beyond them - if it is beyond the wit of the Labor Party and beyond the wit of the member for Batman - to come up with any positive initiative at all for regional Australia, they might at least confirm that they will retain the policies we are so successfully implementing in the interests of country services.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grayndler for his question. It is not often I thank the Labor Party. - I thank them for the opportunity for answering it, too! But I will say this about the youth guarantee: the Prime Minister will remember that the last guarantee given to this parliament was a guarantee by Bob Hawke that no child would live in poverty. There was not too much on that guarantee, was there? But I can tell you what we will be guaranteeing. As the Prime Minister mentioned before, this government has created more job opportunities and more employment prospects, and more young people are in study today than there ever were under the old ALP regime. Indeed, it is interesting because Bruno's `learn or earn' - which we know was plagiarised, even though you sort of heavied him, and we know he gave it to the Dusseldorf forum -  - I would just like to quote - and I think this is important - a transcript of the John and Ross breakfast show on 4BC. They were talking about Bruno from the national youth parliament, who accused opposition leader Mark Latham of plagiarising his learn or earn policy. Learn or earn - I think it is more a `churn' policy, but I will come back to that - for young people was presented by something that you have been highly critical of, the national youth parliament, at the Dusseldorf forum. He said that he is seriously upset with Latham over the pinching of the concept. However, he is disappointed that Latham has not given credit to the group for bringing this concept to the table. I think that puts it into perspective. When it comes to employment prospects it is interesting that, when the now shadow Treasurer was the Minister for Employment in the halcyon days of Keating-Hawke, youth unemployment was at 19.8 per cent. That figure is substantially lower today. Indeed, in my federal seat of Richmond, the level of unemployment for youth is significantly lower than it was when the ALP was last in government.  Interestingly, when you look at it, the risks to young people today are some of the industrial relations policies that you would put into place, if you were ever to gain government, which would have a devastating impact on young people. Of course, they are abolishing junior wage rates and making casual workers permanent. I would have thought that the greatest thing that this government has been able to do is create an employment environment where young people have opportunity. Indeed, when we introduced Youth Allowance it was opposed tooth and nail by the Labor Party because back in those days it was easier to get the dole than it was to go on to further study and education. This government has a very good record when it comes to creating employment opportunities, particularly for young Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dickson for his question, and I know how keen he is to get even more doctors into his area. I can inform him and the House that the Howard government is spending about a half a billion dollars over the current four-year period to get more doctors into medical practice in Australia. Under the MedicarePlus program announced late last year and strengthened earlier this year, there will be 246 extra medical school places every year. That is almost a 20 per cent increase. There will be an extra 700 suitably qualified, overseas trained doctors helped into practice in Australia. Doctors who have taken early retirement or extended maternity leave will also be encouraged to return to medical practice.As well as increasing the number of doctors, we need to improve the distribution of doctors, because too many doctors have tended to cluster in inner city areas close to traditional teaching hospitals and long-established medical schools. But I can tell the House that, since January last year, under the More Doctors for Outer Metropolitan Areas program, some 160 doctors have relocated from inner to outer metropolitan areas. They have gone from areas that are relatively well served by doctors into areas of greatest patient need.Under this carefully targeted incentive program, the House will be pleased to know that there are 18 new doctors in Dickson, 11 new doctors in Macquarie and five new doctors in Dobell. Lest anyone think this program is in some way politically targeted as well as targeted to areas of need, I can inform the House that there are eight new doctors in Lalor and three new doctors in Werriwa, but I am not expecting any time soon to get a congratulatory press release out of either the shadow minister or the Leader of the Opposition. Let me quote Dr Christopher Harrison, who has moved to Tuggeranong: Usually for a GP when you start it takes a fair while to build the practice up, but it has been really busy from the word go.He said of the government's policies:It certainly did influence my decision to work in Tuggeranong, rather an easier environment.Let me make it very clear that this government does not believe in medical conscription. We certainly cannot force doctors to work anywhere other than a place that they choose, but we do believe in carefully targeted incentives and these are delivering more doctors to Australians who need better health care.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lilley for his question. I have got the quinella today. The inference that the shadow minister is making is that families will not receive this. The fact is that every Australian family will receive $600 per child - the first payment before 30 June, and in the next financial year they will receive another $600 payment; that is every Australian family. In fact, the greatest risk to Australian families with the introduction of the family tax benefit is the Labor Party, who have not given a guarantee of supporting the second payment that will be made next year.There has always been a knowledge in Australia that families are receiving very generous family tax benefit, and I must say that since the coalition came to government that has increased by more than 111 per cent from 1996 through to today. All Australian families were major beneficiaries in the budget -   - The facts are that Australian families will all receive - as the Treasurer mentioned, at least 87 per cent receive family tax benefit - Opposition members - Oh! - and 97 per cent of Australian families or higher will receive tax cuts or family tax benefits. Given the line being run by the shadow spokesperson here, the only hope that he can give to Australian families is to scare them. The fact is that they will be receiving $600 per child by 30 June and they will be receiving $600 for every child forever. The average payment now, if you are a single-income family on $40,000 a year, is $4,300. That will go up to around $6,300, an increase of $2,000. All Australian family tax benefit families will get it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I am sure he is aware that as part of the budget the Treasurer brought down a couple of weeks ago there was an extra $19.6 million allocated to Austrade to assist exporters to take advantage of the bilateral free trade agreements that we have negotiated over the last couple of years with Singapore, the United States and Thailand and also to take advantage of the opportunities since China's accession to the WTO and the work we are doing with China in scoping the possibility of a free trade agreement.The objective of the government is to open up new opportunities for Australia's exporters so that we can grow the economy and provide extra economic activity in the community which delivers jobs. That has been happening under the guidance of this government since 1996, and over a million jobs have been created. This is another policy that is aimed clearly at generating good jobs - and jobs in export industries on average are better paid and under better conditions and provide better training for employees. So we are going to allocate this extra funding to Austrade to work with the private sector, with the business community, to seek out opportunities as a result of those free trade agreements. Those new export opportunities equal new export sales, which equals new jobs for Australians, particularly young Australians, in the Australian economy.It is interesting to note some of the analysis that has been done on some of the agreements. For the information of the House, the actual text of the Australia-Thailand free trade agreement is now publicly available, along with the economic modelling on that agreement. That shows a benefit to the Australian economy of $US2.4 billion over 20 years, which is certainly a very good outcome for the Australian economy. I note and understand that the Australian Labor Party are going to support the Australian government on the Australia-Thailand free trade Agreement with that sort of benefit to the bottom line. Yet that free trade agreement and the benefits that accrue to the economy from it are dwarfed by the opportunities and the benefits that will be delivered to the Australian economy as a result of the US free trade agreement, arguably $US6.1 billion after 10 years. It begs the question why the Leader of the Opposition would be prepared to support a trade agreement that is going to deliver $2.4 billion and yet he will not support a trade agreement that is going to deliver $6.1 billion. If you convert that into job opportunities in the community and in our economy, it is many thousands of jobs. If the Leader of the Opposition is serious about generating new jobs, real jobs for Australians in exporting industries in Australia, he will get behind the government and support the United States free trade agreement. </DOC>

 - I will do my best but I, as Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, and the federal government, given the nature of the Australian Constitution, do not have the ultimate say in relation to this. I have to say I regret that that is the case. I think it is an issue which is increasingly national in focus. Rivers flow across state borders and the Great Artesian Basin lies beneath the boundaries of various states and territories of Australia. In order to get a satisfactory outcome we need the cooperation of the states. So far there has been a good deal of cooperation. I welcome that fact. I will be working very hard indeed to do what I can to bring about an agreement. We have put Commonwealth money on the table. We have initiated the discussions. The Deputy Prime Minister has done an outstanding job on behalf of the federal government on this matter. He has done more for water reform in this country than any person I have known in federal politics, and he deserves a great deal of credit for all of this work. But in the end the property rights of this country are determined by the state governments. That might be okay with land; I am becoming increasingly doubtful that it is a good idea in relation to water, because of the fact that it is a national challenge. I take the opportunity in answering the member for New England of appealing to the state premiers to put aside their parochialism on this issue and to recognise that it is a national challenge. I am distressed to hear arguments between Queensland and New South Wales about water entitlements. I think it is a great pity. Seeing that we were able to resolve the impasse over the Tugun bypass between New South Wales and Queensland, I hope it is possible to do the same in relation to water. We will be trying very hard indeed at this meeting. It will be the main item on the agenda. If it does not come off, it will not be for want of the Commonwealth trying and it will not be for want of the effort of the Deputy Prime Minister.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for what is a very timely question, because an important difference has opened up between the policies of the government and the policies of the Latham Labor Party over Australia's response to climate change. The difference is simply this: the Howard government has put in place policies that will bring Australia in or under its internationally negotiated target for greenhouse gas emissions by 2010. That is the first point - our policies have succeeded; we will produce the level of abatement of emissions that is necessary for Australia to reach its international target. The second point is that we have done this in ways that have not imposed huge costs on Australian industry and families, and we have not undermined Australia's international competitiveness in doing so. We are in fact investing over $1 billion in carefully targeted measures to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and we have involved almost all major Australian companies in effective action.The third point is that we can position Australia very responsibly to act for the future in relation to climate change without taking action that will cost jobs, damage our competitiveness or hurt the families of Australia. That is where the massive contrast with the Labor Party has opened up, because despite the fact that the government policies are positioning Australia to reach its international target the Labor Party wants to go further. The Labor Party's approach is to deliberately cut back on Australia's economic growth and to impose huge burdens on Australian industry that will cost jobs and drive investment offshore. There are two planks to Labor's policy. The first is to ratify the Kyoto protocol and introduce an emissions trading scheme. The second is to lift the mandatory renewable energy target to five per cent. Each one of these will impose massive costs on Australian industry and cost jobs. As evidence of this, we have a report that was apparently commissioned by the Victorian government - I suspect on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition - from Allen Consulting to study the impacts on the economy of an emissions trading scheme. - On 19 May, the Australian reported the results of the Allen Consulting study. The Australian stated that this scheme:... would knock out 15,000 jobs, slash the nation-al economy and lead to an explosion in power prices ...Indeed, one of the scenarios in this report would have raised electricity prices by 27 per cent. I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that he ensure that this report is made fully public as soon as possible. It is an emissions trading scheme, which I suppose is as good for workers in the Latrobe Valley as tolls on the Scoresby Freeway are good for all motor car drivers in Victoria. It is a scheme that will take away thousands of jobs from working Australian men and women -  - and their families. Why is the Labor Party doing this? Why is the Labor Party trying to put the brakes on the Australian economy? Because it wants Greens preferences. Because the Greens party does not support economic growth and the Labor Party has been forced, in order to try to get these preferences, to move towards these incredible, crazy policies. Yet, Mr Speaker, there is more, because the Labor Party has gone further down this dangerous road with the Greens party: it has agreed to a five per cent mandatory renewable energy target. The effect of this five per cent target would be to impose an $11.5 billion cost on Australian industry by the year 2020, with a cumulative negative impact on GDP of billions of dollars. So what the Labor Party's cynical effort to buy Greens preferences means is that it is prepared to put the brakes on the Australian economy, to destroy thousands of Australian jobs, to take out the futures of tens of thousands of Australian families, and all for cynical, opportunistic political purposes. The Leader of the Opposition, through the Labor Party's climate change policies, is now playing dice with the future of Australian families and Australian businesses. The Leader of the Opposition is not about climbing the ladder of opportunity; he is now sliding rapidly down the snake of opportunism.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fairfax for his question and his ongoing concern for the many small businesses that operate in his electorate. Tomorrow I will be introducing legislation which seeks to protect small business from unaffordable increases in the costs of running their business. This arises from the decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission which lifted the 20-year exemption for small businesses from redundancy payments. The government has taken the decision to intro-duce this legislation because the imposition of more business costs on small business will simply mean the loss of jobs for Australians. The commission's decision seriously under-estimates the impact that redundancy pay would have on small business. Picture a small business, for example, with seven employees, each with six years of continuous service. Under this decision, that small business would now face a contingent liability for redundancy pay of nearly $30,000. Small business cannot afford this type of impost, and the government will not allow it to occur.Since 1996, the Australian government has taken a series of tough decisions to reform Australia's workplace relations system, which, in turn, has assisted in the creation of 1.3 million extra jobs in this country. This has not come about by way of accident. It has come about because of the consistent, disciplined commitment to reform of the Australian economy. By contrast, the only consistency from the Australian Labor Party has been its consistent opposition to any workplace reform in this country. It should come as no surprise to members that since 1993 the Australian Labor Party has not supported any major reform of the workplace relations system in Australia, and indeed it has been pointed out to this House on other occasions that it stood in the way of reforming the unfair dismissal laws on some 40 separate occasions. It appears also that the Labor Party intends to stand in the way of this legislation. In fact, when asked about it, the Leader of the Opposition said:We're not here to overturn the independent decisions of the commission, I can assure you.This government will not stand by and let decisions like this damage Australia's economy and lead to the destruction of jobs in this country. What this indicates, once again, is that the Leader of the Opposition does not understand the impact on small business. He does not understand the impact of standing in the way of reforming the unfair dismissals legislation, and he does not understand the impact of his crazy, casual policy. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition does not understand the detail on these positions whatsoever.We saw, today, another example of the lack of attention to detail by the Leader of the Opposition, who confused, either wittingly or because of his sloppy research, the difference between youth and teenage unemployment in this country. This total, sloppy attention to any detail is something which he has repeated on a number of occasions now. It is little wonder that the Combined Small Business Alliance of Western Australia has said that small business should `be afraid, be very afraid' of the Australian Labor Party. The refusal of the Labor Party to support small business is further evidence that the Leader of the Opposition does not understand the detail of the Australian economy and therefore could not be trusted with it. </DOC>

 - Australia will not ratify the Kyoto protocol until the ratification of that protocol will protect the long-term national interest of this country. We have a very simple proposition. We are not blinded by some mythical belief that by ratifying the Kyoto protocol you are going to bring untold benefits to Australia. I might in this context remind the Leader of the Opposition of what he had to say at the time of the Cunningham by-election, when he basically said that the environmental policies of the Greens, which he now appears to have embraced, would export thousands of jobs from traditional Labor areas of Australia. That was the rhetoric of the Leader of the Opposition at that time.The problem with the Kyoto protocol as presently cast is that developing countries such as Russia and China would not be subject to the same strictures as developed countries such as Australia. And if we adhered to the protocol, as requested by the Leader of the Opposition, that would disadvantage the resource industries of Australia because they would incur burdens that the resource industries of countries like Russia and China would not incur. That is the reason why we will not sign. That is the reason why, incidentally, I suspect that the Labor premiers of Western Australia and Queensland are far less enthusiastic about endorsing the Kyoto protocol than is the Leader of the Opposition. Our position is that we will meet the Kyoto target set for Australia of 108 per cent, and we are well on track to do that. We will continue to work towards a more effective global response, but that global response has to include all the major emitters, and until it does it is not in the interests of Australia to ratify the protocol. It will cost jobs - it will cost the jobs of unionists and non-unionists alike - and it will do very great damage to the resource sector of Australia, which is not in the national interests of this country.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Herbert. It is not the first question he has asked me about Iraq, particularly about the welfare of Australian troops in Iraq. As the member for Herbert he is a great advocate for the interests of his constituents -  - As I think the House would be aware from media reports, a car bomb exploded around 100 metres from the Australian representative office in Baghdad yesterday. It exploded outside the al-Karma Hotel. An Iraqi boy was killed and several other Iraqis were wounded, but fortunately no Australians were harmed. Can I just take the opportunity to condemn this cowardly act, and of course we extend our sympathy to the families of the victims. The Prime Minister and I have both spoken to Neil Mules, our representative - if you like, our ambassador - there in Baghdad, and I must say both the Prime Minister and I agree he shows a great deal of courage, as do the staff who work with him. It is most impressive and it is most heartening, and they are good and decent people.It is not clear who perpetrated the attack, and it is not clear what the target was. There is obviously much speculation as to whether the target could have been the Australian representative office - the Australian embassy - or whether it was not. We just cannot rule anything in or out at this stage. But I do note that the Australian representative office is protected by 86 Australian Defence Force personnel, and I can only say that we appreciate enormously the protection of our staff in the Australian representative office by our own Defence Force personnel. Iraqi police sergeant Safaa Abbas, who was at the scene, did say, I think, that the Australian mission was the target, but he went on to say that their security prevented the car from getting nearer.I reiterate: we do not know whether the target was the Australian mission or whether it was not. But, irrespective of the target, this blast simply underscores the need for Australian Defence Force personnel to be in Iraq to protect the Australian mission there. I would have thought that that would be commonsense. There is no doubt that terrorists are determined to sabotage and subvert Iraq's transition, and no doubt they will make every effort before 30 June to do that.The Leader of the Opposition has said that he wants to withdraw Australian troops from Iraq. He repeated that yesterday. He is in favour of withdrawing Australian troops from Iraq. That, we assume - because he is not telling the public anything different - includes the 86 Defence Force personnel protecting the Australian mission there. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition said on 27 April that our troops there were merely symbolic. He said: ... there is a worry that the deployment is symbolic. It is being driven by political timelines rather than military strategy ...That is an outrageous thing to have said. That is an extremely offensive thing to say about the Australian Defence Force personnel, and, what is more, it has been exposed as being utterly false. The fact that those 86 Australian Defence Force personnel are protecting the Australian representative office means it is not a deployment that is symbolic. It is a deployment that is practical.It clearly demonstrates a point that I remind the House of - the Leader of the Opposition still has not got a briefing from my department on the function of the Australian Defence Force personnel in Iraq, and he still has not got a briefing from the Department of Defence. We checked again with the defence department today. He still has not had those briefings, he still does not know what the forces are doing there, he is still making a political point to the public that their role is entirely symbolic and he is still saying that the troops need all to be withdrawn. Not everybody in the Labor Party is saying that, but the Leader of the Opposition is. If I may say so, that shows what a vacuous person he is.</DOC>

 - The document the Lead-er of the Opposition refers to expresses a view - it does not prove a fact; it simply expresses a view. The government has taken a decision. I actually believe that the lump sum payment is much better than the staggered proposal of the Leader of the Opposition. I also point out to the Leader of the Opposition that our payment is more gen-erous. It reaches the $5,000 figure prior to that of the Leader of the Opposition's alternative proposal. It is also non-means tested.The view we take is that any incentive that payments of this kind may represent to the potential or current mothers of Australia to have children should be available to all Australian mothers and should not be subject to any kind of means or income test. I take the opportunity of reaffirming the superior quality of what the government has offered to that offered by the Leader of the Opposition. I also remind him of a basic fact of government - that bureaucracies and advisers advise governments; governments decide. We decided on a policy that is superior to that of the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - First can I thank the honourable member for Gilmore and say how much I appreciate her interest in the work of the staff at the Australian representative office in Baghdad. There are nine of them there and they are advancing Australia's interests in very difficult circumstances, as the House will know. The Australian representative office is vital to facilitating Australia's humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in Iraq. They also, of course, advocate our commercial, political and security interests - for example, they have been very effective in helping us maintain our wheat exports to Iraq, and they need to liaise with the Coalition Provisional Authority and others. Importantly, our office there also provides consular services to Australians. The House will be aware that a dual national was picked up by the Kurds some time ago and is being detained in Iraq. We have an office in Baghdad. People from that office are able to see that person who is being kept in detention.Australians are making a vital contribution to Iraq's rehabilitation and preparation from transition in a range of areas. We have a $40 million agricultural rehabilitation program. That has ensured, for example, that the Iraqi agricultural ministry is up and running and doing a good job. We have a treasury adviser, and, not surprisingly, one of the things our treasury adviser has done is provide Iraq with its first fiscally responsible budget in 3½ decades. So some of the work of our own Treasurer and some of the ideas of our own Treasurer have been passed to Iraq and they will have a very good effect on the Iraqi economy. I think most Australians would agree with that.We also have Defence Force personnel helping with the rebuilding of the Iraqi army and navy. The proposition being put by the opposition is that we should withdraw the 86 Defence Force personnel who protect these people who are doing reconstruction work in Iraq. That is the proposition of the Leader of the Opposition. Who would protect, in those circumstances, the Australian staff working in Baghdad? I think it would have to be said that it would be risible to think that a Labor government, having withdrawn Australian Defence personnel, would go to the Americans and ask the Americans for that protection. It would be risible because the Americans would think it was a pretty extraordinary piece of hypocrisy to go to them and ask for that protection, having for party political purposes and electoral purposes withdrawn the 86 Defence personnel protecting our office there.How otherwise would the Labor Party's policy - glibly espoused by the glib Leader of the Opposition in his glib interviews - of providing humanitarian assistance to Iraq be executed? Who would protect the people who are implementing that policy? Of course, the member for Griffith understands the dilemma here, because this morning when he was doing his daily, if not several times a day, doorstop interview, he said: `We would be looking for advice from the most appropriate source of diplomatic advice in Canberra, and that would be the diplomatic security adviser with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.'So this is the policy now of the Labor Party: `maybe we would keep the 86 Defence Force personnel there if DFAT advised us to do so'. I can help the opposition. I can tell the opposition what DFAT's advice is without them having to seek it. As the minister I can just ask them myself, and I have chosen to do that. I asked Dr Calvert, the head of the department, what his advice was, and I will read to you what he said to me in a note. He said:If the ADF security contingent were withdrawn, there would be no available alternative arrangement that could provide the same level of security. In that situation, assuming the same security risks continued in Baghdad, I would recommend the withdrawal of the ARO. I will table that letter because it is important that people understand. The Leader of the Opposition is going out there telling the Australian public - always glib but not very often accurate with the facts: a bit of Clinton - that he is going to withdraw all the troops. The opposition spokesman says, `We may not withdraw them all if DFAT suggests we don't.' DFAT is suggesting you do not, so is the Leader of the Opposition's position now that he will not withdraw all the troops - that he will leave 86 troops in Iraq - or is he still misleading the Australian people and telling them he can provide humanitarian assistance to the Iraqis without any protection whatsoever for those Australians providing that assistance? I think this whole episode exposes the absolute farce of the Leader of the Opposition's glib, Dick Morris style strategy out of a book called Behind the Oval Office. That is all it is - it is Dick Morris. We do not want a government run by Dick Morris and Bill Clinton; we want a government run, if I may say so, by John Howard. That is a much better alternative.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chifley for his question. It is an issue that I am very happy to address. Could I say first of all to the member for Chifley that his question appears to be based in part on a bit of misbelief as to the reality about teenage pregnancies in this country. Nobody welcomes a high incidence of teenage pregnancy - nobody. Everybody hopes that children are born into an environment where they have two parents available, a mother and a father, to bring them up in a stable, loving environment. The reality is that fewer than two per cent of Australian teenagers have a child in any year, and the long-term trend is downwards not upwards. This compares with about five per cent in the United States and three per cent in the United Kingdom. And teenage birthrates in Australia are low despite our relatively generous welfare and family assistance systems.There is not as much empirical evidence as is popularly believed that a substantial number of teenagers will choose to have children when they would not have done so previously. The common view held by, I think, too many Australians that single mothers are typified by teenagers who go out and get pregnant in order to get social security benefits is just plain wrong. The overwhelming majority of single mothers in this country were previously married or in stable relationships. I have not met many single mothers who are single mothers by design; most of them are single mothers because of the break-up of marriages. Having said that and, I think, explained the background of this issue, it stands to reason that many of the concerns that are implicit in the member's question are ill-founded. What the Labor Party has done, if I may say so, with respect to the member for Chifley, is to try and design a baby care payment or a maternity payment that looks as much as possible like paid maternity leave without in reality being paid maternity leave. I think in reality what you have to do with these things is be up-front about what sort of payment you want. I know there is a strong body of opinion in the Labor Party in favour of paid maternity leave, and there are some people in my party who are more supportive of it than others.I was always relatively agnostic about the value of paid maternity leave as such. I have felt for a long time that the better thing was to have a lump sum payment that went to every mother, irrespective of their income, and that is essentially what we have done. The Treasurer has indicated that in extreme cases such as drug addiction you might have to take some care about the payments, but I think staggering the payments is a rather inadequate, weak attempt to mimic paid maternity leave. You either believe in paid maternity leave or you do not. The reality is that the Labor Party do believe in paid maternity leave but they do not want the world to know it, so they try and dress up their baby payment or maternity payment in the way they have. I think ours is better, and what is more I think the great majority of Australians think it is better too.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Farrer for her question. I reiterate that, as a result of the budget which was brought down Tuesday two weeks ago, every family eligible for family tax benefit will be receiving an additional $600 per child per annum. If you are on the minimum amount, it will go up from $1,095 to $1,695, and if you are on the maximum amount, it will go up from $3,401 to $4,001 per annum. More than that, as evidence of the government's bona fides, the first increase will be paid before 30 June, and the second will be available upon reconciliation in respect of the financial year finishing on 30 June.Yesterday I was informing the House about the number of families in various electorates, and I have been asking for more work to be done in this area to try to break the numbers down further. In the electorate of Farrer, there are 32,469 families and I have asked for some more work to be done to break down how many of those families have children. A better measure of families than the household measure which I gave yesterday, shows that in Eden-Monaro there are 33,398; in the electorate of Werriwa, 36,871; in the electorate of Bendigo, 31,734; and by tomorrow I will hopefully have broken it down even further to actually have the number of children involved, because the number of Australian families with children involved, as I said, who benefit from either family tax benefit increases or tax cuts is 99.8 per cent.I am asked what threats there could possibly be -   - We welcome the intervention of the member for Hotham in Australian political life. We would like to see a lot more of him. I am sure he is working up to a question today, too. I am speaking through you, Mr Speaker, to say that we welcome the member for Hotham's intervention in Australian political life.What is the Australian Labor Party's position on tax and family benefits? Let me characterise it like this: the member for Hotham has said that Labor intends to collect less tax, spend more money and have more left over at the end of it. So you take in less, you spend more and you have more left over. Those of us who read him carefully know that he was not nicknamed `BS Crean' for nothing - BS stands for bigger surpluses, under which you take less in, put more out and you are left not only with a bigger surplus at the end of it but also with an intergenerational fund, which not only gives a bigger surplus today but will also be used to fund tomorrow. -  - No, that is not BS; that is Mr Crean MP - Magic Pudding. Of course, there are some amongst us who wonder how all this can be done and why we have not thought of doing it before - taking less in, paying more out, having more left over and funding future generations as well. So we look very carefully for how it can all be done in this new realm of tax cuts and spending for everybody, and we await with great anticipation the announcement of Labor's tax policy.I do want to refer the House to two things that were written today. The first was by Max Walsh in today's Bulletin. I do not think Max Walsh would be considered a supporter of the coalition. He has certainly never felt obliged to say anything nice about me in the past. - Yes, I am coming to the Sydney Morning Herald. I thank the member for Lalor, who always intervenes at the most inopportune time for her. Max Walsh writes in today's Bulletin:... this year's budget is actually good public policy designed for long-term national outcomes.The government has presented its strategy on the ageing of the population:Central to this is the philosophical embrace of supply-side tax cuts - a novel, even radical, approach to fiscal behaviour in Australia. It has filled out its intergenerational strategy with a family assistance package that is far more supportive of working mothers.The high-tax campaign in the media is being led by the Sydney Morning Herald, in particular Ross Gittens. Ross Gittens has cottoned on to this one central fact: how could the Labor Party be promising more tax cuts for everybody, more spending, more left over at the end and an intergenerational fund to pay for 40 years time? This is what Mr Ross Gittens said in the Sydney Morning Herald:... there are very tight limits on how much Labor has available to spend on election promises. Put most of the money into a tax cut for low and middle income earners and there's precious little left to pay for what would really appeal to voters: increased spending ...If Labor was smart - Listen to this - it would promise to can the second tranche of the tax cuts for higher income earners ... Labor is smart - too smart for Ross Gittins. Labor intends to can the second tranche of the tax cuts; what it does not intend to do is promise it before the election. The shadow Assistant Treasurer, the member for Kingston, who is generally regarded as having the brains of the Labor outfit -   -  - it is true; it is in comparison to the member for Hotham - came out to bat for Labor the day after the budget. Do you recall what he said? He said that the money was not quarantined. He made one statement and retired hurt for the next two weeks. He has not been heard of since. The shadow finance minister came out and said, `All we're guaranteeing is the family tax benefits up to 200405.' Ross Gittins is absolutely right: you cannot take less, spend more, have more left over and put together an intergenerational fund. What Ross Gittins says is here. Labor, if it is serious about spending, will `can the second tranche of the tax cuts'. There is a reason why the backbench are listening intently at this point: the awful implications of what is being planned are just starting to dawn on them. There is one thing I would say to the Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party, if elected, is entitled to take back those tax cuts. There is no doubt about that. You did it in 1993 and you can do it again. But what you cannot do is run -  - The Labor Party cannot run to the next election pretending that it supports those tax cuts but with a plan to take them back afterwards. Labor has to come clean. It has to name its tax policy; it has to name its family tax policy so that the people of Australia can know the truth before the election and not after, if Labor were to be elected.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fraser for his question. All I can say is that I think we should have lots more of these polls because I am fascinated with the fascination of the Labor Party with opinion polls. I suppose when you have been in parliament for 30 years you do remember a few things and you do learn a few tricks. One of the things that I have remembered and observed over a period of 30 years is that when political parties, particularly oppositions, get infatuated with opinion polls they normally hit the wall.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question; he has a very strong commitment to quality education. In facing our future it is obvious for Australian universities that, above all else, it is quality that counts. The Australian government, the Howard government, has announced and implemented policy to invest an additional $2.6 billion of public funds in Australian universities over the next five years - to increase places and for better quality, better teaching and better resources for our students as they go through Australian universities. One of the changes which was requested by the universities themselves was that they, for the very first time, would set the HECS charge which would be levied from zero - no HECS whatsoever - to a level no more than 25 per cent above what it currently is. It is important that the House and Australians understand that with HECS, the Higher Education Contribution Scheme, the Australian taxpayer pays for three-quarters of the cost of university education and students pay back about a quarter of the cost of that education, not when they are students but when they have graduated from university and are earning in excess of $36,000 a year. In other words, as far as HECS is concerned, it is free at the point of entry and, as the British Prime Minister has said, fair at the point of repayment. Throughout Australia at the moment, universities are now in the process of implementing these reforms. We have 17 universities that have decided to increase the HECS contribution - 13 of them by up to 25 per cent and  four of them by less than 25 per cent - eight universities are not changing HECS at all and 13 universities are yet to decide. Every single dollar of that HECS goes to the university to benefit the students who will be educated in that university, while at the same time Australian taxpayers, many of whom have never seen the inside of a university, will each contribute three additional dollars.The Labor Party has said repeatedly that it is opposed to any increase in HECS, including up to 25 per cent. In fact, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition have both stated this on numerous occasions. As a result of the decisions that have been taken by the 17 universities in Australia that have chosen to increase HECS, those universities will receive an additional $377 million over the next four years to benefit the education of Australian students. That is $377 million in addition to the $2.6 billion that this government is committing in public funds to universities. On Meet the Press on 18 April this year, Brian Toohey asked the Deputy Leader of the Opposition a question, and she said:Well, we've in fact put our entire higher education policy out last July ... It's primarily made up of this commitment on indexation ... And of course we'll wind back the 25% price hike.Brian Toohey then asked - and this is very important:But is that additional money on top of compensating universities for the 25% price hike?The Deputy Leader of the Opposition then said, `It includes the 25 per cent price hike compensation. That's part of it.' So she made it very clear on this occasion, and others, that the Labor Party's policy includes compensation to the universities for the 25 per cent price hike where they have chosen to apply it. I then went to the Labor Party's policy booklet, Aim Higher - the name of Tony Blair's higher education policy I might add. I went to page 23 of Aim Higher. I was looking for at least $377 million. By the time the other 13 universities have made decisions, it might be $400 million or even $500 million in compensation. I went to the costings. I was looking for the HECS compensation fund and maybe $400 million or $500 million. Do you know what I found in the Labor Party policy document? How much has the Labor Party budgeted to fully compensate universities for increases in HECS? $15 million.It is embarrassing. The Labor Party has budgeted $15 million to fully compensate universities for an up to 25 per cent price increase over the next four years. Then - Prime Minister I ask you to restrain yourself - I thought I should be excessively generous. I thought, `Okay, we've got $15 million. We are now looking for another $362 million or thereabouts to basically compensate for what the Labor Party is doing.' I went further down the policy and found indexation. I was looking for indexation, and what I found was $312 million. In other words, the Labor Party's indexation to university funding over the next four years and its compensation fund, at a piddling $15 million, do not even add up to what will be required to fully compensate universities over the next four years - probably $400 to $500 million. I ask the Leader of the Opposition: which group of Australians are you seeking to mislead? Is the Leader of the Opposition seeking to mislead the Australian universities into believing that they will be fully compensated for this 25 per cent increase in HECS, or is he showing his economic illiteracy and seeking to mislead the Australian taxpayer into believing they will not have to fork out at least another half a billion dollars, added to the half a billion dollars already found by the department of finance as a hole in Labor's higher education policy? This is not just deception on Australian universities - it is a con trick on the Australian taxpayer. The more scrutiny that is provided to this prior to the election rather than after it, the better off all of us - in particular, the children in Australian universities - will be. I table my department's analysis of the incomes being derived by universities from HECS, I table the transcript of the Meet the Pressprogram of 18 April and I table Labor's policy document, including what pass for costings.</DOC>

 - They never cease to fascinate me. The first question from the member for Fraser was enticingly obsessed with opinion polls, and the second one presupposes that we are going to win the next election. I am fascinated with that. The member for Fraser can ask as many questions as he likes about this subject. He knows my position on these matters, but in the end I think the member for Fraser ought to understand that I, like every other Prime Minister of this country, am at the disposal of the Australian people. They will decide my future. What does cheer me up, and it cheers me up more after each question time - in fact, my good humour is almost turbocharged after each question time - is when I realise that as each day approaches to the next election - I will not say how many days - more and more the focus of the Australian people will be on: do they want the economy of this country run by a government led by me, so ably assisted by the Treasurer, which has done such a remarkable job, or do they want the economy of this country managed by the former mayor of Liverpool and Mr Magic Pudding from Hotham? I have got to say to the Treasurer that he has had 8½ years. Treasurer, why did you not discover this formula? Why did I not discover it? I have wasted 30 years! If I had spoken to the member for Hotham I could have saved myself all of that trouble. If I had found that elixir, that magic formula, nothing would be impossible - absolutely nothing. You could climb any political mountain. You could satisfy any interest group. This is the dilemma, because as each day ticks by the Labor Party has one less day to reveal its taxation policy, to explain how on earth it can make good its claim that it is really offering more for health and education than the coalition, when, in reality, it is not. - You should have a look at your figures; you should analyse them. One of the great frauds perpetrated by the Labor Party is that they believe in spending more on health and education. The reality is the reverse. Indeed, the education policies of my colleague the Minister for Education, Science and Training, as he demonstrated a few moments ago, are far more generous to the education sector. Can I say to the member for Fraser: please keep asking questions about this; I love it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. Members opposite like to pose as the champions of Medicare, but, on the evidence, this government - the Howard government - is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. In the coming year, this federal government - the Howard government - is going to spend $41 billion on health. Since 1996, health spending as a percentage of the federal budget has increased from under 15 per cent to over 20 per cent. Since 1996, federal health spending has increased from 3.7 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product to 4.3 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. What MedicarePlus means is an extra $4 billion for health over the next five years. It means more doctors and nurses. It means more incentives for bulk-billing. It means more convenience for patients. Above all else, it means a brand new safety net to help those Australians who are most in need of support.This government is delivering on its commitments. There are 231 suitably qualified, overseas trained doctors who have been issued visas since December. There are 430 new practice nurses who have been employed since February. The national bulk-billing rate increased in the last quarter. More than 200,000 Australians are already benefiting from the new Medicare safety net, and more than $7½ million has already been spent on providing higher Medicare rebates to them. In the course of a full year, more than a million Australians will benefit from the new safety net, to the tune of nearly $150 million every year.What is the Labor Party's policy? The Labor Party's policy is the great health rip-off. They are going to scrap the new Medicare safety net. They are going to take away benefits from the sickest and the most vulnerable people in our community. Members opposite like to pretend that they are going to spend more money than this government on health. That is an entirely bogus claim - a completely fraudulent claim. On 14 March, the member for Lalor told the Meet the Press program: We won't be operating this sham safety net arrangement.On 31 March, in an official statement, the Labor Party announced that it would cut $324 million out of the government's Medicare spending. The only party in this parliament that has any plans at all to cut any health spending is the Australian Labor Party. The message is now sinking in for millions of Australians: a Labor government means higher health costs for you. That is what a Labor government will mean: higher health costs, because they will rip the guts out of the private health insurance rebate and now they will scrap the new Medicare safety net.</DOC>

 - I do accept that it is a fundamental principle of democracy that people are entitled to know who they are voting for, and I imagine the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act will apply at the next election and you will have a ballot with the names of every candidate - and it now even shows the party affiliation. But there is something else that is fundamental to a democracy, and that is that people are entitled to know not only who they are voting for but what they are voting for. People will be entitled to know at the next election whether they are voting for the second tranche of those tax cuts to be swiped back. I imagine that there will be a few relatively mature voters around who will remember the election that was held in what, 1993?A government member - That's it! - I seem to remember that one of the predecessors of the current Leader of the Opposition, as leader of the Australian Labor Party at that time, went to that election offering something - it was l-a-w law tax cuts! Everybody knows what happened after that. I thank the member for Fraser. I invite him to keep going, but could I tell him that, yes, everybody will know who they are voting for; but, more importantly, will the Labor Party come clean and tell us what they are going to be voting for?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question and for his interest in economic policy. As a former teacher of economics, he is somebody who follows the debate very closely in this country. As people will remember, after the 1993 election the Labor Party went on to produce another three deficit budgets. When this government was elected, the budget was in deficit by $10.3 billion. When the coalition was in opposition, there was not an argument in this country about what you should do with a surplus in a budget. There was no surplus in a budget. The whole political argument, when the coalition was elected, was what you would do about deficits in your budget - how big your deficit should be. An indication of how the economic debate in this country has changed is that we no longer debate how large our federal government deficit should be. But if there is a change of government this would become a live question again. The importance of policy is what elections are all about. If the government could promise everything to everybody whilst cutting taxes for everybody and having more left over at the end of it - not just for today but for 40 years time - there would not be any science in politics. We would all be geniuses. If you could take less, spend more, have more left over and provide for 40 years time as well, there would not be much argument about politics. But politics is arguing about choices, policies and what is affordable; and this is where scrutiny comes in. The best indication to date - and I mean this entirely seriously - of what the Labor Party are proposing is in the Sunday Age of last Sunday. It is the first time that the Labor Party have ever deigned to put out the numbers behind what they are proposing. I would ask every member of this parliament, including the members of the Australian Labor Party, to look at the Sunday Age of last Sunday to get some idea as to what the Australian Labor Party are really about. This is their so-called savings. Their `savings' is redirecting the government's MedicarePlus package: $2.4 billion. That is not a saving; that is a determination not to spend it on a safety net but to redirect it to other areas. It is not a saving; it is a redirection. That is the first point.The second point is this. It is not an increased investment if you are taking $2.4 billion which is being used in one way in the health system and using it in another way. You will hear the mantra of the Labor Party over and over again, `We're going to invest more in Medicare,' but when you actually go to the figures you find that they are not. What they are doing is redirecting out of the safety net back into the health system. But in net terms there is neither additional investment nor net saving.We then have what they propose to do in higher education. They propose to abolish the government's policy - $1.8 billion - increase diesel fuel excise for the mining industry, reintroduce the student loans scheme, which comes to $2.4 billion, and redirect it to their own education policy. Again, that is not an increased investment or a net saving. It is a new tax and a redirection. The Minister for Education, Science and Training has today pointed out a very important point in this debate: if you want to get more money into higher education, the taxpayer can put it in or the student can put it in. This government has allowed, under its HECS system, more money to be put in from the student's point of view - as the minister said, $377 million extra this year. But the Labor Party are opposed to that policy, and the Labor Party have promised to abolish that policy. That means either taking that $377 million out of the sector or the taxpayer putting it in instead. There is one problem with the taxpayer putting it in instead: it is not in Labor's policy. It is just not there. So if the Labor Party are to believed and they are abolishing that policy, then - far from the Labor Party increasing money for higher education - they are taking $377 million out.We are now faced with this proposition: no increased investment from health and no saving, no increased investment from higher education but the possibility of a $377 million shortfall. So this mantra about `We're going to spend more on health and education' must be in policies which are still to come, which are still to be announced. It is certainly not in the policies that have been announced.As I go down the table from the Sunday Age I see there is no net saving out of health and no net saving out of education. There is a new tax on the mining industry. The Labor Party say they will oppose the costs of the sale of Telstra, which will produce a saving. But also, obviously, they will not get a dividend and they will not cut their interest payments. So that does not produce a net saving off the budget. That is $6 billion of the so-called $7 billion of savings, and I could go through the remainder. But there is no provision for a tax cut for everybody. We know from last year's budget that a tax cut for everybody costs $10 billion. But the Labor Party derided those tax cuts as being not nearly large enough. So, if they are going to produce bigger tax cuts, we are at $10 billion and starting. This is what the stuff of policy is all about - actually sitting down and comparing alternatives. There is one previous occasion that I am aware of when somebody promised to spend more money and then said they would find the savings and make it all balance. The Liverpool council was an example of where a young mayor said, `By increasing my expenditures, in the years to come I'll find expenditure reductions which will set them off.' Liverpool council, the place of the last application of this economic policy, deserves very close scrutiny. The Liverpool council, on this theory, ended up in deep debt and deficit and has now been replaced with an administrator. And that young mayor said: `It wasn't my fault. My task was to spend the money. Others had to find the expenditure and the savings afterwards, and they never got around to doing it.'The public of Australia will believe that running an economy is just a little more complex than running the Liverpool council. The public of Australia is entitled to know precisely how these policies will be paid for, and it is entitled to the scrutiny of a press which will demand answers to these questions and will want to know, in the contest of policy, where the Labor Party really stands so that the people of Australia make an informed choice at the next election.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question and in response to him say that the Australian government has a significant and proud record on youth unemployment. I remind the House that in 1993 youth unemployment in this country was at 18.8 per cent. It is now at 11.9 per cent because this government has created an environment in which young Australians can get a job. If you take some specific examples, it is even lower than that. If one goes out to Liverpool, for example, one finds that youth unemployment has dropped from 15 per cent in March 1996 to 4.2 per cent in March 2004. Part of this was because this government was prepared to take on the union bosses and enshrine in legislation youth wages - a policy which the Leader of the Opposition then supported. Of course, that was before he erased his past. If the union bosses had had their way, many more young Australians would be out of a job.Now the risk to Australia's young people is that the Australian Labor Party will destroy that opportunity. The Labor Party wants to destroy casual employment in this country, the Labor Party wants to abolish junior wages in this country and the Labor Party wants to keep unfair dismissal laws. In essence, the Labor Party is proposing to rip away the first rung of the ladder of opportunity that the Leader of the Opposition pretends to hold out to young Australians.The Labor Party wants to make casual employees permanent. This would simply mean that many businesses, particularly small businesses, would not be able to employ young people. The Labor Party wants to abolish junior wage rates, something which the Australian Retailers Association has estimated would cost some 200,000 jobs in Australia, many of which go to young Australians. And, of course, the Australian Labor Party says it wants to keep the unfair dismissal laws which discriminate particularly against young workers in this country. So, under the Labor Party's plan, no matter how much young people learn they will not get the opportunity to earn.This is an astonishing and outrageous plan, made even more outrageous by some comments by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. In the interview on Meet the Presson 18 April which the minister for education referred to, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was also asked some questions about casual employment. The interviewer, Paul Bongiorno said:But, Jenny Macklin, isn't it a fact that a casual job is better than no job?To which the member for Jagajaga replied:Well, I don't think that's the case ...This is an outrageous proposition: to say to young Australians in particular - the young Australians who we have been giving an opportunity to - that it is better to have no job than to have casual employment in this country. This is what the ALP believes: that young people in this country are better off without a job. The Australian Labor Party ought to be embarrassed about the outrageous proposition advanced by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Rather than create the opportunity for young Australians to enter the work force, Labor would prefer that these young Australians have no job and no opportunity. This is a perfect example once again of why the Australian public should look not at what Labor is saying but what they are doing.You cannot have a plan to address youth employment when you are trying to restrict the opportunities of young Australians by abolishing junior wage rates. You cannot have a plan to address the opportunities of young Australians when you want to keep unfair dismissal laws that discriminate against young workers in this country. And you cannot have a plan to address youth unemployment and youth employment when you believe, as the member for Jagajaga has said, that you are better off not having a job than having a casual job in Australia. The Leader of the Opposition does not even understand what the definition of youth employment is. For this reason, I will table for his benefit the Australian Bureau of Statistics definition of `youth', which he has been all over the place on in the last few days. If the Leader of the Opposition has his way, unemployment in this country - which is at a 20-year low - will once again go through the roof and young Australians will be the first people who will be hurt. This proves once again that the Leader of the Opposition has no attention to detail and he cannot be trusted with the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moncrieff for his question and recognise that he is a great advocate for small business, as is the coalition government. It is a great advocate and a great deliverer for small business. Two excellent surveys, giving a real snapshot of business confidence, have been released in the last few days. The Australian Chamber of Commerce small business index survey has shown that sales revenue, profitability and capital investment have all risen in the last quarter, with some indices reaching record levels. The Sensis survey, released just a few days ago, shows that business government among SMEs remained at historically high levels during the May 2004 quarter. It is good news. It is a good business environment for small business. One of the reasons that has come about is because of good economic management. That is about focusing on the fundamentals of the economy and not being distracted. And, importantly, it is about listening to the community. Over the last few months we have held home based business seminars and community meetings in Canberra, Parramatta, Coffs Harbour, Brisbane, Mooloolaba, Darwin, Adelaide, Melbourne, Perth and Hobart. I attended every one of those except for one. The overwhelming feedback from small business is, `Keep your eye on the economy.' Many small businesses in particular said, `Can you do something about the paperwork associated with the BAS?'In the budget delivered a couple of weeks by the Treasurer, the government responded to the concerns of small business. Over 740,000 small businesses - 70 per cent of Australia's 1.1 million small businesses - operate from home or at home. Many of those businesses have a turnover of less than $50,000. With a $348 million initiative in the budget, as at the beginning of next year, 740,000 small businesses in Australia need lodge only one BAS, one GST payment, once a year - one BAS, one GST payment, once a year for 70 per cent of Australia's small businesses.Let us compare that to the Labor Party's much promoted ratio method. Under the Labor Party's method: four BASs and four GST payments every year. Under the coalition: one BAS and one GST once a year. Under the Labor Party's ratio method, the Australian Taxation Office is going to tell small businesses how much they owe. A little birdie told me that a senior frontbencher from the Labor Party addressed a small business group in the last 24 hours and, when pushed on the details of the Labor Party's ratio method, he advised this group of leading small business people that the Australian Taxation Office would provide advice to every individual business. Under Labor Party policy, 1.1 million businesses would receive quarterly advice from the Australian Taxation Office about how much GST they owe. How is that going to stack up? - I asked that question too, Simon: what - how is that going to work? - The member for Hotham should speak to one of his colleagues, because that is what he advised a small business group last night would occur under the ratio method. It is intriguing. Do you know what the fundamental flaw is in the Labor Party BAS policy? The fundamental flaw is that Australian small business may well end up paying more GST than they owe. That is the fundamental problem. What the Labor Party does not understand is that every business has a different level of turnover every month. Under those circumstances, how is the ATO going to tell those businesses what to pay - without any reconciliation? - Where does the ratio come from? - Past practice. So, under those circumstances, what the member for Hotham has just confirmed is that the ATO is going to individually advise every business. - Well, how is it going to work?  - I have read it. - I understand that, Mr Speaker. - It is a very interesting discussion. We are keen to know how the Labor Party's policy is going to work. They have one frontbencher running around telling one story to small business and another frontbencher running around telling another story to small business. But the fundamental truth is this: under the coalition, 70 per cent of Australia's small businesses will have to lodge only one BAS and one GST payment once a year. Under the Labor Party, it is four BASs and four GST payments every year.If the Labor Party think it is such a winner of a policy, I am afraid I will have to quote an economist. I know there have been a lot of quotes from economists today, but I have to refer to Robert Gottliebsen - again, not necessarily a fan of the coalition. When talking about the Labor Party's GST ratio method, Robert Gottliebsen said that it is `a quick way of going broke'. The Labor Party and the GST - `a quick way of going broke'. So too will the Labor Party send the country broke. Under Labor Party policies, they forget about the facts, they do not get the details right and the community ends up picking up the bill.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I can inform the House that, as outlined to the House by the Prime Minister on previous occasions, the government is in discussion with the company, Wyeth, about how quickly we can get access to this vaccine and about what price it will be. I can say this: we do want, if we can, to provide this vaccine, and we do want to provide it, if we can, as quickly as possible. What we will not be doing is paying for it by ripping away the MedicarePlus safety net. If you look at the Labor Party's policy, it is proposing to fund a universal pneumococcal program by scrapping the MedicarePlus arrangements that were made in the Senate, including the MedicarePlus safety net. We are not going to provide one lot of people with a benefit by ripping off a benefit from other people.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for his question. I know he is one of the members on this side of the House who understands the importance of the American alliance. While the government does not agree with the American administration on everything - on the comprehensive test ban treaty, on the International Criminal Court, on some other private issues or on American agricultural trading policies - there is no doubt that we have a profoundly strong view that the alliance with the United States is fundamental to our security. During the war against terrorism, particularly in relation to the challenges we face in South-East Asia with Jemaah Islamiah and like organisations, the assistance that the United States is able to provide in that war against those terrorists - particularly the intelligence assistance, the defence technology, the tremendous dynamism that they are able to bring to regional diplomacy to encourage countries in the region to address those terrorists organisations - is fundamentally important to our national interests. It is not surprising that over the last eight years the government has unashamedly strengthened the alliance with the United States. We have fought together in the war against terrorism. We of course cooperate in Iraq. We have negotiated a free trade agreement with the United States. We have worked very closely together on the issue of counter-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction - a very good example of that being our support for the Proliferation Security Initiative - and we are working with the Americans on the issue of missile defence. Are there any alternative policies? Well, the interesting thing about the opposition on this issue is that their positions are constantly changing and there are great divisions within the opposition. I do not think we should underestimate the depth of division there is in the opposition on the issue of the American alliance. As the House knows, the Leader of the Opposition has a history of making vicious and often rather foul-mouthed attacks on the United States, the alliance and the President of the United States, and I do not think we want to revisit that. But when the member for Werriwa became the Leader of the Opposition, he started, at the beginning of that time, to tell a different story, as though within a matter of a few days his whole personality had completely changed. Everything he had stood for had been abandoned when he went into the Labor Party caucus room and almost literally draped himself in the American flag - quite incomprehensible, really - and said, `I am a very strong supporter of the American alliance.'What is interesting is that he has not been able to hold to that 4 December position for very long. Every sign is beginning to re-emerge of the Leader of the Opposition's anti-Americanism. The Leader of the Opposition opposes the free trade agreement with the United States, which offers us $6 billion a year. He is against missile defence cooperation. He is against the Proliferation Security Initiative. He wants to cut and run from Iraq and abandon our allies. There is not any sign that that curious event of 4 December was anything but yet another one of the Leader of the Opposition's publicity stunts - something at which he is a master. The fact is the Leader of the Opposition's anti-Americanism was illustrated by his decision to cancel his visit to the United States next month. He invented the excuse that there would be an early election, despite the fact that he is not only allowing his frontbenchers to go to America but - as the Treasurer pointed out yesterday - allowing the member for Hotham, for some reason, to go to Kenya. - What is interesting, though, about the Labor Party is the depth of the divisions on this issue. The member for Brand and Senator Ray, for example, who are unequivocal supporters of the American alliance, are finding their experience and advice is being ignored for that of Dangerman, the member for Kingsford Smith apparently; Paul Keating, who is a great source of advice; and even Gough Whitlam.I thought it was very revealing that in the Bulletin of 18 May an informed source, talking in a very favourable article about the Leader of the Opposition, said, `Latham's private views about the Australian-American alliance are said to be extreme.' I think there is every sign that this is true. I think there is every sign that he rejects the Hawke legacy, he rejects the Beazley-Ray legacy, and that on these issues he adopts, apparently, the foreign policy of Dangerman. There is a curious juxtaposition here in the way the Leader of the Opposition seems so totally obsessed with the state of the union addresses of Bill Clinton and the writings of the glib Dick Morris. Other than that, it has to be said that there is a kind of visceral anti-Americanism coming through which I do not think, in the end, at a very difficult and dangerous time in global history, is for a moment going to be in the interests of Australia or the Australian people. I think it is about time the Leader of the Opposition - instead of playing games and thinking he can get away with saying absolutely nothing of any substance to the Australian public - came clean and started telling people a bit more about what he really believes in. </DOC>

 - This question is obviously prompted, as most opposition questions are - the first three or four - by something in the newspapers. Can I deal with this question by first of all stressing that there is absolutely no suggestion whatsoever that Australian soldiers or other military personnel serving in or around Iraq have been involved in any way in the abuse of Iraqi prisoners which we have seen portrayed in the media. I have already answered questions on this subject as to my knowledge, and so have the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The advice consequent upon the story in the Sydney Morning Herald today that we have from defence is that the ADF has not been involved in the incarceration or interrogation of Iraqi prisoners. Even more significantly, defence has publicly stated that no ADF member witnessed any mistreatment of detainees. - The suggestion made in today's article in the Sydney Morning Herald of a cover-up is quite absurd. It is also highly offensive in that it seeks to imply a link between Australian personnel and these appalling abuses. To illustrate that point, could I read from one particular part of the story. It says, inter alia:... Major O'Kane's role suggests that assurances by the Defence Minister, Robert Hill -  - I will return to the paragraph. I will take a moment to answer this question, because I assume it is accepted as an important matter, and I therefore intend to deal with it in a detailed fashion. I will return to the Herald article, which says:... Major O'Kane's role suggests that assurances by the Defence Minister, Robert Hill, that Australian military personnel were in 'no way associated with these abuses' may be misleading.I just want to say that that is a pretty contemptible and pathetic attempt by the Sydney Morning Herald to imply some kind of guilt by association. That is what that story is into, and can I say that some of the member for Griffith's questions go dangerously close to doing the same thing. Can I specifically go to the substance of this issue: that I am advised that a report by the International Committee of the Red Cross in October of last year covered general concerns about detainee conditions and treatment. Major O'Kane, as part of his work in the coalition headquarters in Iraq, prepared a draft response to that report. A separate report by the Red Cross, in February of this year - and once again this answer is based on the current advice of the defence department - raised allegations of ill treatment of detainees. It would appear at this stage that the article in the Sydney Morning Herald has either inadvertently or deliberately conflated those two reports - the one in October and the one in February - and has blurred the two of them and, in the process, could well have done a serious injustice to Major O'Kane. To suggest that, because Major O'Kane drafted a response to the October report, he or the Australian government were in some way aware of the more serious allegations to follow in a separate report some months later is quite nonsensical.I am in fact advised that Major O'Kane witnessed no interrogations or mistreatment of detainees and has previously reported to the defence department that he believed internees were being treated with humanity and in accordance with the Geneva convention. I repeat that: I am advised by the defence department that Major O'Kane witnessed no interrogations or mistreatment of detainees and has previously reported to Defence that he believed internees were being treated with humanity and in accordance with the Geneva convention.We are now all aware of the photos of incidents of serious abuse which have been displayed in the media. Our government have made it very clear how concerned and appalled we are by these incidents, and we very warmly welcome the strong and decisive action that has been taken by the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom to investigate these incidents and to bring those responsible for them to justice.Let me repeat that, as I indicated earlier, the first time I became aware of the scale of the alleged abuses was at the time most other Australians did, sometime in April when the photographs emerged. There was a CNN report in January. I may or may not have seen that at the time - I cannot specifically recall that. It has already been indicated - and I would have to check the record to get the precise language used by the defence minister, the foreign minister and perhaps me - that various reports were sent back by our people on the ground in Baghdad during the early months of this year. But I would have to recall the record to attest precisely to what those details were.Let me finish by stating again that there has been no Australian involvement in these incidents. No Australian personnel have been involved. All of this is about trying to imply some guilt by association, because that is the stock in trade of the Australian Labor Party. They do not like to be reminded of it, but it is the stock in trade of the Australian Labor Party. Just as the overwhelming majority of the 139,000 Americans who are serving bravely and in very difficult circumstances in Iraq cannot be held responsible for the appalling abuses of a few, so it is the case that the 850 Australian defence personnel serving in and around Iraq should not in any way be associated with those abuses. There has been no Australian involvement. Australia was not an occupying power. Australia did not detain or accept prisoners in Iraq. Up until the circumstances which brought this matter to international prominence broke, Australia had not been given any reports from the ICRC, although not formally but informally I understand a report or some reports have subsequently come into the hands of the Australian government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question. She travelled with me to Baghdad during the course of last year and met with Australian soldiers there, amongst other people, and I know what support she has given to them. The ADF deployment in Iraq is vital to advancing our national interests in Iraq. It provides security for the Australian representative office which is absolutely essential for the tasks that it undertakes - representations, lobbying for Australian companies, assistance with humanitarian programs and so on. As I pointed out to the House yesterday, without those 86 soldiers our mission would close. That is the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and that is the advice we would take.The House would be aware that HMAS Stuart and two P3C surveillance aircraft are defending Iraq, from further afield, from terrorists and that HMAS Stuart notably foiled an attack by terrorists on an oil terminal on 24 April. What more is the ADF doing? It is training the Iraqi army and navy so they are able to take over the security of Iraq. So I would have thought what the Australian troops were doing in Iraq made perfect sense. Anybody who had been briefed on this issue - and the Leader of the Opposition still has not sought a briefing on this question - would understand the importance of having those people there. It seems to me that it is absolutely commonsense. The day after the bomb went off about 100 metres from the Australian mission the Leader of the Opposition was reported in the Herald Sun as saying that his position was to bring the troops back home, and he said on 27 April:We haven't got a huge military and we've got other choices and priorities to make in terms of the defence of Australia.The member for Brand, the former Leader of the Opposition, made a speech last night. I read it this morning. It is a long read, but it is a very interesting speech, to be fair. It is not always flattering about the government or me, but that is the nature of party politics. It is a thoughtful speech made by somebody who knows something about these issues. The former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, makes the point that it is well within Australia's capacity to provide at least the force now being provided by Italy, Poland, Ukraine and the Netherlands - which is four times the size of ours. He went on to say that we have plenty of troops available. I am not saying the member for Brand is arguing that we should be sending many more troops to Iraq, because he is not. But I am saying that the member for Brand, who knows something about defence policy, is clearly contradicting the off the top of the head remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition.What is interesting is that the member for Griffith supports both views. The member for Griffith did an interview with a German newspaper - a Berlin newspaper - Die Tageszeitung. There used to be, by the way - honourable members will remember this; those who have been here for a little while - a convention in Australia that you did not go overseas and bag your government or bag your policies. Do you remember that? I think we remember that. The member for Griffith may be - as you, Mr Speaker, have said - a rather new member, but he might like to be reminded that going and speaking to Die Tageszeitung and bagging the Australian government for the benefit, no doubt, of the Berliners who are reading the newspaper is not really in very good taste. You are not on the side of Australia if you are going out and bagging us to the Berliners. Let us just make that point. You might think that the German Social Democratic Party approved. But in the end do you know whose side we on this side of the House are on? We are on Australia's side. That is the side we are on. In this curious interview the member for Griffith says, `Policy changes in Australia would include an early withdrawal of Australian troops from Iraq.' That was the position he articulated. Does that surprise anybody? Yes, it does surprise me, because less than 24 hours after the bombing by the Australian embassy in Baghdad, on the question of whether our 86 troops should stay there, the member for Griffith was not for withdrawing the troops. He was saying, `We're looking for advice.' He says one thing to the Berliners and he says another thing to Australians.I have to say - and the Treasurer made this point yesterday - that the Leader of the Opposition needs to be scrutinised by the media and he needs to be scrutinised by the parliament and he needs to be scrutinised by the Australian people. There is nothing but policy confusion on the side of the Labor Party. There is no clarity in what the Labor Party would do. Somebody should ask the Leader of the Opposition a simple question; somebody should ask this: do you want to close down our office in Baghdad or will you leave 86 troops there to protect them? What is the answer to that question? The Leader of the Opposition, having read in Dick Morris's book that you do this, will sit there and say nothing because Dick says to say as little as you can to the public. That is what Dick says. - The Leader of the Opposition is drifting back into the sort of gutter that he has lived so much of his life in. Dick says, `Do not tell the public too much.' That is why you say nothing and you will not answer that serious question. The Australian public have a right to know if ever this country should be so unwise as to elect you the Prime Minister.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Flinders for his question. I can inform him that the capital expenditure survey for the March quarter was released today. Measured by chain volumes, it showed that capital expenditure fell 2.5 per cent in the March quarter but it remains 3.9 per cent higher over the year. The volume of capital expenditure remains at historically high levels following six per cent growth in the last six months and 14.8 per cent growth in 2002-03. The decrease in the March quarter appears to have been caused by a decline in the importation of civil aircraft, and abstracting from those aircraft it appears that underlying capital expenditure was broadly unchanged for the quarter. For the current financial year, 2003-04, businesses are expecting to reduce capital expenditure by 1.7 per cent. But this would convert to solid growth in volume terms when you take into account the recent appreciation in the exchange rate and the significant falls in the price of imported machinery and equipment as a result of that. Business investment will make a solid contribution to economic growth in 2003-04. Looking at the expectations for the next financial year, 2004-05, businesses are expecting to increase the value of their capital expenditure by between three per cent and six per cent. Again, the fall in the price of imported equipment will contribute to very solid growth in volume terms. This is showing that business investment will be a big part of our growth in 2004-05.Can I just give a comparative figure the member for Flinders would be interested in? In the last eight years of the Labor government business investment grew 3.6 per cent per annum. Over the term of this government, private business investment has grown 8.2 per cent per annum. That is more than double the rate of growth under the last eight years of the Labor Party. Why? Interest rates are low. I was asked about people in Flinders. I know that home buyers in Flinders and small businesses in Flinders will appreciate the fact that interest rates are low.Profitability of business is very high. The profit share to GDP is as high as it has ever been in Australian history. We have taken taxes off Australia's exports. We have cut capital gains tax; we have cut company taxes; we are cutting income taxes. We have locked in low inflation. None of this is an accident. It is not something that happens by fluke. It is not something that failed mayors with their nostrums of various economic theories could produce by accident if they were put into positions of trust in the Australian economy. It takes consistent economic policy to produce outcomes for Australia's businesses and for Australia's families and for the employees who depend upon them. That economic management is something that this government has fought hard to put in place and will not be surrendering.</DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member for Cunningham, I am aware of that finding. It has been the longstanding policy of governments of both persuasions to pay a veterans' affairs entitlement according to criteria which apply in relation to relationships in the rest of the community - namely, married or de facto relationships as commonly understood. It has not been the disposition of governments of both persuasions over the years to change that. I have announced today on behalf of the government certain changes in relation to superannuation which we think are fair and will expand the categories of people who will be able to exercise superannuation benefits and entitlements without tax penalty, and it goes significantly beyond extending that to people in same-sex relationships. Indeed, it includes quite a lot of other relationships that can be regarded as characterising financial interdependency, including sisters and brothers, adult independent children and their parents and also, very importantly, an extension in relation to handicapped children of elderly parents - or indeed parents of any age - who may, for understandable reasons, not be living with those parents. I think they represent very important, very positive changes which I know will be widely welcomed in the Australian community.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Canning, and can I say what a pleasure it is to have him here in the House representing the seat of Canning - and may he stay in the House a very long period of time. I also thank him for the opportunity to talk about job creation. I think the House will be interested to know that, since this government was elected in 1996, there have been over 1.3 million new jobs created in Australia. The unemployment rate is at 5.6 per cent - as low as it has been in 23 years. Indeed, in the last six months alone, 164,000 new jobs have been created, 80 per cent of which have been full-time jobs.The most important thing that a government can do for a family is create the economic conditions in which that family has the opportunity to find work. If a family does not have somebody who is in the work force bringing home an income, then it does not have the stability and the financial support that it needs. So it is our view that everything that can be done should be done to help job creation in this country - and that is not just the view of this government. I would like to refer the House to the OECD economic survey which quotes a survey done by D. Harding in 2002 which found - get a load of this:Unfair dismissal laws in Australia contributed to the loss of about 77,000 jobs from businesses which used to employ staff and now no longer employ anyone. The OECD survey also said:Countries that have a decentralised bargaining system and more relaxed employment protection legislation are better equipped to innovate in industries characterised by multiple and rapidly evolving technologies.What they are saying is that if you have a flexible workplace, ease of hiring and firing, you can innovate in those high value add areas.Although unemployment is low by historical standards, the point is this: unemployment could go lower in Australia if the Australian Labor Party would get out of the way and pass this government's unfair dismissal law changes. They have now been rejected 40 times in the Australian Senate. And there is the evidence, endorsed by the OECD: 77,000 more Australians could get their foot onto the ladder of opportunity - they could get into the work force and start going up that ladder - if the Australian Labor Party would get out of the way and allow this government to reform unfair dismissal laws.I must say that there are days when you read the press with a heavy heart and there are days when your heart leaps from within you as you read the morning press. I must say that one of those days was today, when I think the hearts of so many Australians leapt from within them by reading today's Australian: Labor's workplace relations spokesman, Craig Emerson, has admitted that small businesses do not hire staff because of the ALP's union backed unfair dismissal -  - The opposition whistleblower. - As the honourable member for Gippsland says -  - We certainly welcome the fact that there does seem to be some sense returning to the Australian Labor Party and in particular the member for Rankin. -  - Somebody interjects that he denies it. What, does he deny that there is some sense returning to the Australian Labor Party? We welcome the fact that it appears that some sense is returning to the Australian Labor Party. In particular, we welcome the recognition that the small businesses of Australia will become employment-averse if they are subject to the risk of litigation under unfair dismissal laws which have been found by the OECD to have destroyed jobs, or not to have allowed the creation of jobs, and which are restricting the small businesses of Australia in a way they should not be. On this side of the House, we support small business. While the Labor Party refuses to allow small business to be rescued from the shackles of those unfair dismissal laws, the Australian Labor Party will always stand condemned by the small business community of Australia.We say that the member for Rankin is right. He was right when he spoke at that meeting last night, when he said:That when he ran a small business he did think about what might happen if he had to dismiss someone.That is a quote, and it is not denied. - The member for Rankin was quoted in the Australian - a quote which is not denied - as saying that he did think about what might happen if he had to dismiss somebody, as hundreds of thousands of small businesses do at the moment. Small business and their employment prospects in this country are too important to the future of Australians for the union backed members of the Australian Labor Party to insist on union rights and union power, at the expense of small business. It is about time that the union bosses that control the Australian Labor Party were told to get back into their box, that they will not be listened to, that the businesses of Australia are too important, that the jobs of Australians are too important, that those young people who want to get on the ladder of opportunity should have the chance to work, that the Australian Labor Party will not for the 41st time block these unfair dismissal laws, that we will get on with sensible industrial relations reform, that small business will get a go and that more jobs will be created in Australia. </DOC>

 - I am not specifically aware of that report but I have certainly read a lot of reports that speculate about the impact of a further increase in the price of crude oil. Let me say that the current price of crude oil is influenced by a lot of factors. It is influenced by the increased demand for crude oil, particularly from China. It is influenced by the onset of the summer season in the United States and by the depletion of the strategic oil reserve in the United States. It is also influenced by the unsettled conditions in the Middle East. While we are into predictions, I think that, if the coalition were collectively to cut and run from Iraq, that country would be plunged into great bloodshed and chaos, and the impact of that on the price of crude oil would be absolutely disastrous. So anybody who is running around saying that the price of crude oil is due exclusively to what is happening in Iraq - as I think the Leader of the Opposition was trying to do in Queensland last week - ought to contemplate the consequences of the West walking out of Iraq and handing that country over to the terrorists, the reaction that would create among neighbouring Arab states and the absolutely catastrophic effect that would have on the stability of crude oil prices. If you want crude at $50 a barrel, support the Latham policy on cutting and running from Iraq. That is what you ought to do.As for the review of the Trade Practices Act, with very great respect to the member for Hunter, the idea that some kind of review of the Trade Practices Act is going to have any direct or real effect - or even an indirect or delayed effect - on the price of crude oil is quite fanciful. The price of crude oil is set by a combination of international circumstances. The member for Hunter knows that.Just before concluding, I say that the price of petrol at the bowser is now 5c to 6c lower than it would otherwise have been had it not been for the excise changes that this government introduced three years ago. If we had had automatic indexation of excise - and I remember introducing those changes very well and, if I remember rightly, they were supported at the time by the Australian Labor Party. The member for Hotham, the man of the magic pudding, criticised it. But it is 5c to 6c lower as a result of those changes. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question and recognise the great and continuing support which she provides for the many small businesses in her electorate. Labor's cloak of hypocrisy on its stand on unfair dismissals legislation was unwrapped this week by the member for Rankin. As the Treasurer indicated, in the story in the Australian today, we have the member for Rankin quoted as saying that when he ran a small business he did not think about what might happen if he had to dismiss someone.This is not the first time that a member of the opposition on the frontbench has actually criticised the unfair dismissal laws on behalf of that party. One of the other members of the frontbench, at the other end of the front bench, also said something about unfair dismissal laws when he said this on the Small Business Show: `Well, my wife constantly tells me that she could afford to put on one more person, or would like to put on one more person, but is fearful of unfair dismissals.' The difference is of course that the member for Hunter, who said this, was upfront and open about saying it, unlike some other comments we have heard recently from another member of the frontbench of the Labor opposition. But what is interesting about these unfair dismissal laws, which, according to COSBOA, cost something like 50,000 jobs in Australia and, according to the OECD, something like 77,000 jobs -  - The member for Rankin jokes about that. I would say to the member for Rankin that the cost of even one job is too many, let alone 50 or 60 or 77,000 jobs. But what is interesting about this is not only the fact that the Labor Party has voted against our changes to make these unfair dismissal laws fairer for small business in particular in Australia on some 40 occasions but the fact that the member for Rankin, in this report today, is quoted as saying:... the ALP recognises the concern among small businesses and has proposed changes to streamline the laws and remove 'the perception' that the laws cost jobs.We on this side of the House and in this government are not concerned about the perception; we are concerned about the reality that these laws cost jobs - a reality that the Labor Party stand in the way of every time and oppose our propositions to change the laws. But it is worse than this. It is not just a question of the ALP's past record to date in relation to this; it is a question of what they actually propose to do if they are ever elected to government.As the Treasurer says, they do not read their own policy platforms very often, but we certainly scrutinise them, and I would like to bring to the attention of the House the recent National Platform and Constitution 2004 of the Australian Labor Party. In chapter 3, at paragraph 94, there is the following provision: Labor will ensure that filing fees are not a barrier to access to relief from unfair dismissal.We are talking about a filing fee of $50. The Labor Party are proposing to remove the filing fee, which would lead to a flood of frivolous and vexatious claims for unfair dismissal. Everywhere I go around Australia, small business operators come up to me and complain about frivolous and vexatious unfair dismissal claims.I was out in the member for Macarthur's electorate just a week ago, where a small business operator - he and his wife run a business - was telling me about an unfair and frivolous claim which meant not only additional costs to that small business owner for the professional advice he had to seek but also that he had to take a day out of his business to go and front up because of this claim. This is happening to literally thousands and thousands of small business operators right across Australia. And what does the Labor Party propose to do? To remove a filing fee so we get a flood of these claims. This is absolutely outrageous.On top of that, we have a proposition here in the national platform of the Labor Party to go further and allow unions to make a single application in the case of mass terminations. So we will get more of these claims which will destroy jobs in Australia. What this indicates once again is that, when it comes to managing the economy and managing the workplace relations system in Australia, the Australian Labor Party have no clue whatsoever. They simply cannot be trusted in this regard.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his very well-informed question. It is quite true that the Labor Party's unfair dismissal laws have had a negative impact on Australian small business. In fact, according to COSBOA, they cost small business in excess of 50,000 jobs, and that is just from the application of the Labor Party's unfair dismissal laws at a federal level. When I went through the Hansards in search of the reasons why the Labor Party is opposing our changes, which propose to exclude the application of unfair dismissal laws to small business, I came across the words of the member for Rankin, who said: It - being the government - continues to bang on about unfair dismissal laws costing jobs. It does that despite having been told ... that its claim is spurious and wrong.As the Treasurer told the House, we looked at the paper this morning, and it said:At a closed meeting of more than 20 members of the Council of Small Business Association in Canberra on Tuesday night, Dr Emerson presented Labor's policy and said he understood the problems business had with the unfair dismissal laws.It goes on to say:According to several people at the meeting, Dr Emerson then said he had not employed extra staff for his small business because of fears about the unfair dismissal laws.So I thought, `Wow, this is a significant step forward - the spokesman for the Labor Party on workplace relations conceding that even he did not employ someone because of the unfair dismissal laws.' - I am coming to that, Mr Speaker. I want to deal with a statement made this morning. This morning the member for Rankin addressed the House, and I ask my colleagues to understand the words carefully, because the member for Rankin did not deny in his words that he said that on Tuesday night. He said:Having been told last night by a representative of COSBOA that I made no such statement at the meeting, the journalist persisted with the story.So, in fact, the member for Rankin has not in this place yet denied that he uttered the words which are reported in the Australian today. He has not denied it in this place. He went around it, saying that COSBOA denied it, and we have no evidence that COSBOA have denied that. - We would be intrigued to get it. We will be waiting for it to come shortly. We are systematically asking people who attended the meeting exactly what was said. As soon as we can get the reports that are out at the moment on further comments made by individuals at those meetings we will bring them to the attention of the House. We want the member for Rankin to deny that he said those words in this place, because as far as we are concerned he is playing games. He said the words. The allegations were backed up by a number of people in today's Australian that he said the words that he did not employ an individual in his business because of the unfair dismissal laws. He came in with a cute personal explanation, when everyone who was at the dinner who was paying attention to his words knows that the member for Rankin uttered the words that he did not employ someone because of the unfair dismissal laws. But what we do know about the Labor Party is this: the Labor Party have a history of going behind closed doors and saying one thing to people and then coming into the parliament and going public and saying something entirely different. That is the way they operate. They are hypocrites. They operate one way behind closed doors to business and they operate another way when they are dealing with the Australian public.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I indicate at the outset that the government's policy in relation to bank fees is the same policy the Labor government had from 1983 until 1996. At no time in those 13 years did the Australian Labor Party ever have control over or monitoring of bank fees.  - In fact, they had numbers of inquiries on the issues and at no time did they ever impose it.In fact, from time to time you will hear other members of the Australian Labor Party boasting that the Australian Labor Party deregulated the financial markets. The Labor Party ought to decide which position they want to take: either they had the great achievement of deregulating the financial markets or they believe in re-regulating the financial markets. But they cannot hold both positions at the one time - unless, of course, they go to a meeting of bankers behind closed doors and have one position and then come out and have another one publicly.The RBA's credit card interchange fee standard is expected to reduce credit card interchange fees by around $400 million a year - a reform which the RBA put in place and which was endorsed by this government. Also, over the period since 1996, margins on loans have come down quite considerably. It may well be that in previous times banks were covering themselves and making profits through margins, and increased competition has actually improved the benefits for consumers by reducing those margins.I want to conclude by indicating two areas where this government has dramatically improved the situation for fees on bank accounts. The first is that this is the government that abolished the bank account debits tax as part of our GST reforms. I will go further than that and say that, as part of the GST reforms which this government implemented and which the honourable member opposed, on 1 July 2005 the financial institutions duty will be abolished, saving people $1.4 billion in fees on banking.I got an agreement from all of the Labor treasurers at the last meeting of the ministerial financial council for that abolition to take place on 1 July 2005 - let me say, not before time. The abolition of that tax will be paid for by the state GST revenues, now in a record position as all of those states enjoy the growth of revenues. It is the coalition government that is insisting that that revenue be used in part to reduce taxes - not the Labor states and not the Labor opposition; it is the coalition government that is doing it. We look forward to 1 July next year, because tax reform keeps rolling on with the abolition of $1.4 billion in financial institutions duty.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parkes for his question. Indeed, transport and logistics constitute nine per cent of the Australian economy and there are a lot of people in both large and small business in the sector. It is very important to jobs right across Australia - I think the Minister for Trade pointed out that one in five Australian jobs depends on trade, and one in four in regional areas.Reform in the transport sector has been successful in many ways. We have real transport costs at their lowest levels ever in Australia, which is quite an achievement in itself. But, of course, it is within the transport portfolio that you find perhaps the most potent example of the need for and benefits of industrial relations reform right across Australia. That, of course, is in the waterfront. When we were in opposition, no more potent an example existed by which you could demonstrate to people the need for industrial relations reform and talk about the national disgrace that was our waterfront.We had had endless inquiries into it. I think, if my memory serves me correctly, there were 39 inquiries between 1945 and us coming to power. Interestingly, the Labor Party - occasionally you will get a little bit of an outbreak of honesty over there; just occasionally - had actually conceded that the waterfront needed something done about it and they had set up a program called WIRA - the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority. It failed, but they at least conceded there was a problem.When we came to power we said again that we were going to have a go at industrial relations reform on the waterfront. What happened when we announced the modest target of 25 container movements an hour on average across our major ports? The ALP and the union movement, having failed to reform the waterfront, said, `That's un-Australian - you can't achieve it in the Australian context.' Did we achieve it? Yes, we did. For the last 13 consecutive quarters we have exceeded our own target and, indeed, in the last quarter we were managing around 27 container movements per hour on average. This is a very potent symbol of what can be achieved. There is no doubt it is greatly to the benefit of people in rural and regional Australia and exporters generally. When you raise this at community forums and inform people that it would all be sacrificed under a Latham government because Martin Ferguson -  - The member for Batman, rather - would give the waterfront back to the MUA, you can see them visibly react with horror. But there is another way you can get a reaction. You can say to people, `Do you know that 41 times we have attempted to relieve you of the burden of unfair dismissal laws and 41 times the Labor Party in the Senate has opposed that reform?' -  - They contest the number. They say it is not 41, it is only 40. The fact is that you have repeatedly blocked it. - The Treasurer enjoys watching Lateline. I am not quite such a fan of that. My old mate Tony Jones - we were at university together - has shifted a bit of political ground since then. I do not find I have quite so much in common with him anymore. - I do not know that I do have more interesting nights than the Treasurer - we will stay out of that! I have to say I enjoy my early morning copy of the Australian. I was delighted this morning to find a lot of very encouraging news about Farmhand, which of course the Australian was involved in, and water politics.But I was even more delighted when I thought I had at last discovered a kindred spirit on the opposite side. I have not found much in common with them before - not much in common with the member for Rankin - but I discovered two things. He had been a small business employer. I have been one of those and I still am. I thought: `This is very interesting. He has employed people. He will understand then that unfair dismissal is a real problem.' Indeed, he went on to confirm it. According to several people at the meeting that he attended just a couple of nights ago, Dr Emerson said he had not employed extra staff for his small business because of fears about the unfair dismissal law. Before I was in this place - as a minister, I stress - I was in precisely the same situation. I stopped employing young people, having got caught up in this web, because it became impossible to proceed. Several young people in my area did not get a start because of the actions of one young person I took on, who embroiled me and my manager in this mess, and we said, `It is not worth it.' I thought we had a kindred spirit. Do you know why I do not believe his denials? Precisely because he has been a small business employer - that is why I do not believe his belated denials. - Mr Speaker, he has been a small business employer - that he does not deny. Not many people opposite have been a small business employer. Plenty on this side have; the person who asked the question has. If you have been an employer in the small business sector, you know what a problem this is. You know it costs jobs. I see the member for Rankin does not deny that. He has been an employer - he knows it costs jobs and he does not deny it. He really belled the cat recently when he made this very interesting comment:The Labor Party and unions are in partnership once again.Who are they in partnership with once again? The union movement. What percentage of the private sector work force belong to the union? Seventeen per cent. I tell you what: they are not just against small business, they are not just against the employers, they are taking the side of the unions against the workers and, in particular - to the shame of the Leader of the Opposition - young workers looking for a job. Here is a challenge: side with the workers and move against the union movement on unfair dismissal.</DOC>

 - This is not an unexpected attack from the member for Grayndler. He is a member who just cannot say anything positive, does not understand or appreciate the positive nature of Work for the Dole - what it does for individual self-esteem and employability and what it does for the community. I invite the member for Grayndler to actually sit down with some of these purposeful individuals, who are trying to do something for themselves and their community and build a better self-esteem and a better opportunity for themselves. That is what Work for the Dole does. I am very well aware of the report in today's Melbourne press, which went on to be on 3AW today. And it was interesting, because a number of personnel that are participating in those particular programs rang the program. I have got some of them here. One was a 58-year-old. As a 58-year-old she, or this person, volunteered. Now she or `Dale' - I don't know whether Dale is male or female; I did not actually hear, I am just reading from the Media Monitors report - says: `I am 58 and I don't have many qualifications.' She, oh it is she, says she is unemployable and is defending Work for the Dole. This is the person that we are here to help - a 58-year-old, mature worker who wants a hand. We make no apologies for helping these people and for what they are doing.What did she say? She says that she is on the dole and she is painting murals and electrical light poles, and she says, `I am making the area more attractive, and I am trying to destroy graffiti.' We all know that when you let graffiti blossom, you also let crime flourish. Here are people who are unemployed, who are working on a community activity, who are feeling positive about what they are doing and who are doing something for themselves and for their community. This is about the first rung of the ladder of opportunity. This is about people feeling good about what they are doing and achieving for their community.It is interesting that in the Media Monitors today there were also some other reports. Here is one from the ABC Southern Queensland, and it talks about a very worthwhile project where Work for the Dole members are teaming with Rotary Club members to produce, from bicycle parts, wheelchairs to go to Fiji to help young people with muscular dystrophy to be mobile. This is the sort of project that that lot over there ridicule. This is the sort of project that you want to see removed from the face of Australian society. The member for Grayndler talks about the Labor Party policy for youth. The fact is: it is a fraud. It says that in the next financial year some 8,000 young people will be helped through their project. - I would like to ask the member for Grayndler: who is he going to deny this service to? It certainly does not go to the member for Herbert's electorate - I know that much. And it does not go to the member for Paterson's electorate. It does not go to those people who need it. It is Labor picking winners again, where every young person who is in need, who is on an unemployment benefit and has disadvantage is being helped by the coalition government, not only through Work for the Dole but through a full suite of employment programs. That is why unemployment is coming down under the Howard government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie. I know that she expresses the concerns of many in her electorate about the price of petrol at the present time, due as that is to circumstances beyond the control of the Australian government and beyond the control of retailers of petrol in Australia. I would have thought in the current circumstances that nobody in their right mind would be proposing an increase in excise, but I am wrong: I plead guilty to not understanding the motivations of some.  What has been drawn to my attention is an article in a local newspaper in Western Australia under the heading `ALP president launches $2.50 a litre petrol plan'. I think it is interesting that this should come to my attention on the same day that the member for Hunter says that we can solve it all and get crude down to 50c a barrel by amending the Trade Practices Act. This excellent newspaper report is the best newspaper report I have read today - no, it is the second best. Dennis Shanahan's article in the Australian reporting the member for Rankin is the best but this one follows as a close second. It is written by Vida Caruba and it says:The Western Australian government should increase Perth's petrol prices to $2.50 a litre to encourage more sustainable modes of transport, according to the Western Australian Sustainable Transport Coalition. The recommendation is in the Perth-based group's `Oil: living with less' policy, scheduled to be launched on Thursday by national ALP president Carmen Lawrence.'Oil: living with less' - there is an invitation and a nice photograph. Dr Carmen Lawrence will launch it. It goes on to state:Western Australia faces crossroads as global oil supplies peak and transport costs soar. Personal and state transport is heavily dependent on cheap oil - So let's make it dearer! - But the finite resource is running out. We must act now to reduce oil vulnerability.So I had a look at the pamphlet: it is quite nice; it is professional. I am sure the member for Fremantle would not have been associated with something she did not professionally feel comfortable with. It is a very well put together document. I read the very first recommendation. Listen to this - it says:1.	Incrementally increase excise on petrol and diesel - incrementally, though; they are being fair - to European levels. Not to some new level that is a bit higher - not to some sort of Labor level that is a bit higher. There are no half measures with the ALP national president; we will go to European levels. The member for Petrie asked me, `What is the government's response?' I do not think that this is the time to be increasing excise on petrol or diesel. I can say on behalf of the federal parliamentary Liberal Party and, I am sure, on behalf of the federal parliamentary Nationals, on behalf of the entire Liberal Party organisation and the CLP - everybody! - that we do not believe in increasing the level of excise; we believe in having as cheap petrol as world circumstances will allow. We have the policies in place. We have the low inflation. We cut excise. We got rid of the automatic indexation of excise three years ago. If you want the cheapest possible petrol in Australia, vote Liberal or National.</DOC>

 - The first thing I point out to the member for Melbourne in relation to his question is that Telstra is a corporation under the Corporations Law. It operates under the board and the management. - And it was the Labor Party who put it into that position. The government does impose retail price controls on Telstra, and the purposes of doing that are to drive efficiency improvements and to lower prices for end users in markets where competition is not yet fully developed. - Within this constraint, this corporation may vary its prices as it considers appropriate. Telstra's compliance with the price control regime is assessed annually by the ACCC, and a breach of the licence condition can be penalised very heavily - in fact with a $10 million fine. One of the objectives of the price controls is to gradually remove the access deficit, as recommended by the ACCC and the Productivity Commission, in order to improve competition in telecommunications markets. To achieve this, Telstra is required to reduce a bundle of service prices by 4.5 per cent less CPI, and it is limited to increasing line rental controls by CPI plus four per cent. - The nub of the member for Melbourne's question suggests that line rental prices are affecting low-income consumers. There is in place a scheme under which Telstra provides assistance to low-income earners. One-hundred and seventy million dollars a year is provided for that purpose, and the administration of it is supervised by a committee - the Low-income Measures Assessment Committee - on which a range of consumer organisations are represented. We want to see effective competition in the telecommunications market. That is what will drive prices down. When the access deficit has been removed, that is what we will get.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mackellar for her question and very strong commitment to standards in all things, particularly education. When this government was elected in 1996, it set as its No. 1 priority in the area of school education focusing on fundamental standards - in particular, in reading, writing and numeracy. The member for Goldstein, against opposition from the states, unions and, indeed, the federal Labor Party, developed the National Literacy and Numeracy Plan. This government invested $736 million in that plan, and in 1998 a national system for testing school students in years 3 and 5 for literacy and numeracy against national benchmarks was developed. Whilst a lot of tests are conducted in Australian schools, unfortunately only in four jurisdictions - Victoria, Western Australia, the ACT and the Northern Territory - are the results of national benchmark tests reported to parents. Our challenge as we face the future is not just to educate our children to be proud Victorians or New South Welshmen and women, it is also to prepare them to be Australian and global citizens. Last year in Australia, 24,000 students in year 3 could not pass a basic national benchmark reading test. That means that there are 24,000 students in year 4 today who did not pass the national year 3 benchmark reading test, and of those students 15,500 of their parents do not know that that was the case. In other words, if you want to set a child up for failure in secondary school and in life, do not teach them how to read or write, do not test them against national benchmarks and do not report that to parents.I announced last week on behalf of the government a quite significant change in approach to helping to deal with the problem of illiteracy amongst young children. For the first time, the government will deliver a $700 learning tuition coupon to the parent of every child that failed the national year 3 benchmark test last year in those states and territories that do report those results to parents. Unfortunately, the Queensland Premier, Mr Peter Beattie, speaking on Queensland radio last week was doing one of two things - he was either lying to the Queensland community or showing his ignorance in relation to what is reported to parents. In fact, the Queensland Premier said this to Ross Miller:They are provided - that is, the results - There is material provided to the Commonwealth. These reports go to the parents, as you would expect. This is a minor technical issue.The fact is that the parents of the 5,500 children in Queensland who did not pass the national year 3 reading benchmark last year would not have seen this sheet. This is how the results are reported against the national benchmarks for reading.This government is determined to put power into the hands of parents. A $700 learning tuition coupon will go to the parents when those parents have received the results of the 2003 national benchmark test. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: if the Leader of the Opposition has any influence in the Labor Party, could he please implore Mr Beattie to implore Paul Lennon in Tasmania, Mr Rann in South Australia and, in particular, Bob Carr in New South Wales to get the results of the national reading benchmark test for 2003 out of the vault and to parents in the next month, and then this government will deliver to those parents a learning tuition coupon, worth $700, which can be redeemed at the school so that the children can get some one-to-one tuition with teachers or a private tutor to bring them up to speed with their reading. In other words, the government is about driving national standards and putting power into the hands of parents. There is no stronger evidence of the need for this than the words of parents themselves. - The Labor Party may not think that reading and understanding how to read are important in life, but this side of the parliament most certainly does. In 2002, one parent in the review commissioned by state education ministers in relation to benchmark reporting said:There is nothing wrong with being told that you are not achieving, because there's nothing better than a feeling that you have achieved after working to overcome it. Not telling us isn't fair to the child, and it doesn't fit the reality of living in the bigger world. It also isn't fair to the parents, because they were denied the opportunity to make life better for their child. This government's learning tuition program, in addition to the $400 million a year it provides to support children with learning needs, is about making sure that children are equipped in school with the absolute fundamentals - and that is the ability to read. Some teachers in Australia should spend more time teaching our children how to read, write, count and communicate than producing political material and distributing materials in relation to school funding that present falsehoods and half-truths. The responsibility we and teachers have is to support parents in teaching our children how to read, write, count and communicate. That is the priority of this government, and it has been for 8½ years - and learning tuition coupons will drive it a lot further.</DOC>

 - My recollection of this is that there are two proposals which have gone out for public consultation. One is for 50 per cent of the front and 50 per cent of the back to be a graphic health warning. The other is for 90 per cent of the back and 30 per cent of the front to be a graphic health warning. So, one way or another, more than 50 per cent of the packet will be a graphic health warning. I make the point that this government has a very good record on discouraging smoking, which is of course the largest preventable cause of death in Australia. Since 1996, the percentage of the adult population smoking has dropped considerably to under 20 per cent, which is amongst the lowest smoking rates in the world.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I thank the honourable member for Flinders for his question and for his interest. The government, not surprisingly, is deeply concerned by the terrorist attacks on the so-called Oasis compound in al-Khobar in Saudi Arabia. Although no Australian citizen has been killed, one of the foreign nationals killed is a permanent resident of Australia. The government is, and I think the Australian public generally would be, outraged by the deaths of 22 civilians and the fact that another 25 people have been wounded. The casualties come from 10 different countries, including of course from Saudi Arabia. It is believed the perpetrators of this outrage are al-Qaeda or al-Qaeda linked operatives and they are part of a long-running attempt by al-Qaeda to destabilise the Saudi Arabian economy, and thereby destabilise the Saudi Arabian government, by targeting foreign workers on whom that economy, particularly the oil sector, depends. What I think this attack does, though, is remind people of what the terrorists are trying to achieve. It is easy to forget, when we just look at the scenes on television, that these people have clear objectives. Their objective in the case of Saudi Arabia, and also in the case of the rest of the Islamic Middle East as well as Islamic South-East Asia, is to establish Taliban style theocratic regimes, even if that means that innocent Muslims have to die as a result. We have to appreciate that the terrorists remain strong and they remain determined. You can see them operating in Saudi Arabia and you can see them operating on a bigger scale now in Iraq. What these people want to do in Iraq is to stop Iraq establishing a moderate regime. They do not want to see democracy established in Iraq; they want to see a Taliban style regime established in Iraq.It is very important that the international community understands the real objectives of these terrorists, and it is very important that the international community continues to work together in countering this terrorism. There is no doubt about the Australian government's determination to do that, be it in Iraq, in other parts of the Middle East or, particularly for us, obviously, in South-East Asia, where we have signed a large number of memoranda of understanding and, as a result of those, contributed to the counter-terrorism efforts of those countries. Let me say in conclusion that obviously our embassy in Riyadh is monitoring the situation in Saudi Arabia closely. Today the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has reissued travel advice. We continue to advise Australians to defer non-essential travel to Saudi Arabia, and Australians who are in Saudi Arabia - and there are quite a number of them - who are concerned for their safety should consider departing Saudi Arabia.</DOC>

 - I offer the Leader of the Opposition a pack of 20 Centenary Houses! I mean, really - for the Leader of the Opposition to try to claim some high moral ground! We as a nation have been very successful. As a reformed smoker myself, I can say that the best health decision I ever took was on Easter Thursday, 1979. I remember the time very vividly. It was outside the old Mater Hospital in North Sydney that I stubbed out my last cigarette. On World No Tobacco Day, I have to say as Prime Minister that it is the best personal health decision that I ever took. After a lot of encouragement from my wife, I am very grateful that I finally did give up smoking. I take this opportunity to exhort smokers, the dwindling number of people on both sides of the House who are still smoking, to give up the filthy habit - because it is.All of us would have been moved by the very evocative speech made by the former Premier of Tasmania, Jim Bacon, who I know is a friend of the Leader of the Opposition. I had the opportunity of speaking to Jim just after he made that speech. It was an eloquent and very sad message to so many people. I would like, given the opportunity that I have been given, to particularly address this plea to young girls. The incidence of smoking amongst teenage girls is still alarmingly high. It has become a very infrequent habit amongst many people now of middle age, but there is still far too high a rate of smoking amongst young girls. I hope everybody, by different demonstrations and exhortations, can make a contribution. But, please, in the interests of bipartisan impact, spare us the cant and humbug of somebody who takes $36 million from the Australian taxpayer, courtesy of the rort at Centenary House. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question. I and, I am sure, all members of the House are aware of how serious a global problem is childhood obesity. The World Health Organisation has released the Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, which includes a focus on healthy diets and regular physical activity. The OECD has also expressed concern about escalating childhood obesity levels. There are a number of causes of childhood obesity: lifestyle, a lack of physical activity in schools, and nutrition. There have been several important studies on obesity reported in the Medical Journal of Australia, and these reports show that more than one in four Australian children are overweight or obese. In the most recent studies, an alarming figure of 28 per cent of girls and 27 per cent of boys fell into the category of being overweight or obese. These children are at a substantial risk of developing chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and stroke.The sad fact is that 40 per cent of children in Australia play no sport nor participate in any physical activity. Figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare show that just over half the population does 150 minutes or more physical activity a week, and that is the recommended minimum. In other words, just half do the recommended minimum - and I stress that it is a recommended minimum. This is a very critical issue. It has come upon us rather more rapidly than many people might have expected. That is the bad news. The good news, the experts say, is that, because it is a relatively recent phenomenon, if the right measures are now taken then something can be done in a relatively short period of time to reverse these adverse trends. The message is very clear: we need to eat better, we need to exercise more and we need to engage in more physical activity, in sport.I have had the opportunity over recent weeks to have some lengthy discussions with a number of the major sporting bodies, including Cricket Australia, Netball Australia and the Australian Football League. They have all indicated their willingness to join the government on this matter. We have had lengthy discussions with the Australian Sports Commission. I hope within the next few weeks to be able to make a very detailed announcement, on behalf of the government, of a national action plan to tackle this issue. It is something, I know, that has been the subject of discussion from a number of angles. I welcome, incidentally, the moves that have been taken by a number of state governments - I think most recently by the New South Wales government - to reintroduce a compulsory sporting element. Years ago in state schools - and I speak as a product of a government school in New South Wales - it was part of the curriculum that you did sport on Wednesday afternoon. The regrettable fact is that that has been in retreat for far too long, and it has to come back. You will not do anything to really tackle childhood obesity in this country until all of the schools of Australia, not just a few, make sport and physical activity an integral and extensive part of their weekly curriculum. It will be our objective to do that.I think there is also great opportunity to expand the activities to the after-school hours segment. This particularly applies to the utilisation of the assets of schools, particularly government schools, once again. Those assets tend to lie idle between three o'clock and five o'clock, when a growing number of children are reunited with their parents, whereas in the case of many of the independent schools there are sporting activities after school. There is a lot that can be done. There is a lot that is going to be done. I would hope that this is something that would draw united support and participation from many elements of Australian society.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition is right to an extent. Certainly, funding the pneumococcal vaccine makes considerable sense. There is no doubt about that. Over the last three years, pneumococcal disease has killed five, nine and 10 Australians - not 50, as the Leader of the Opposition claims in accordance with his mendacious statement the other day. It is another figure made up by the Leader of the Opposition to try and score a political point. - The fact is that this government does want to fund a pneumococcal vaccine -  - The government do intend to supply a universal pneumococcal vaccine, but we are not going to write a blank cheque to any multinational drug company. Negotiations are continuing and the government are endeavouring to get the best possible price and the best possible access.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. I can inform the House that today the international trade in goods and services figure for the month of April was released, showing an improvement for the month of April of $178 million on the outcome for March, leading to a deficit of $1.8 billion. The narrowing of the trade deficit was led by growth in exports, which were up six per cent in April and 10 per cent over the year. In particular, exports of rural goods were much stronger, increasing by 13 per cent in April. They are now 20 per cent higher than a year ago, which is welcome news for rural Australia. Although it is too early to say that the drought has totally broken across Australia, it is welcome news that rural exports are up again. Exports rose by six per cent, as I said, and imports rose by four per cent, with strong domestic demand leading to strong growth in goods in the consumption, intermediate and capital areas. I am also asked about company profits. Today the ABS released their Business Indicators publication for the March quarter, providing profits and inventories. This reports that gross operating profits fell two per cent in March but are still a solid five per cent higher than they were a year ago. The March quarter fall was driven by a nine per cent fall in profits in the mining sector and could well be related to the appreciation of the exchange rate. This was offset by strong profit growth in the retail trade sector, where there was 12 per cent profit growth, and the manufacturing sector - and I think members will welcome this - where there was a three per cent increase in March.Notwithstanding that, the risks to the Australian economy are considerable. We have seen in recent times the oil price as high as it has ever been in the past, rivalling that of the first Gulf War. Continuing instability in Saudi Arabia will not help the oil price. The drought has not yet finished, as I indicated before. So the challenges are very great and the government maintains a disciplined economic and fiscal outlook designed to cope with them. The government would be helped if the opposition would pass important legislation now blocked in the Senate, and I again call on the Labor Party to pass the measures which the government has put to the Senate on unfair dismissal, labour market reform and reforming the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the disability support pension. All of these big, long-term changes for the Australian economy would help our economic prospects if Labor would give away its opportunism and concentrate on Australia's medium- and long-term interests. There is still considerable work to be done in economic policy in this country, and I call on the Australian Labor Party to get out of the way and allow the government to get on with doing it.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Without in any way suggesting that reading to your children is unimportant, could I say that I disagree with him. I think the greatest gift you can give your children is love. Reading to children is immensely important, and it is a manifestation. As far as extending the hand of bipartisanship is concerned, what I meant by that, self-evidently, is that we will always support sensible policies which are designed to encourage parents to read to their children. To the extent that the opposition proposes those sensible policies, we will not criticise them. I do not think you will find that the government is being critical of the generality of what the Leader of the Opposition said. Self-evidently, it is a good thing for parents to read to their children. Without engaging in the ultrapersonalisation of these things - and I know the Leader of the Opposition would never do that either - when my children were very young I was in the habit of reading to them. I am quite sure that many of the wonderful fathers and mothers on both sides of the House have done exactly the same thing. When I talk about bipartisanship, what I am really saying is that it is rather silly of either side of politics to try and score a political point on the issue of reading to your children. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. I know that she, as an excellent local member, is interested in the answer because her constituents are interested in the answer. The government has said on many occasions that it is committed to keeping Australian troops in Iraq until the job is done. It is very important that people know what those jobs are. They are training a new Iraqi army so that Iraqis themselves can take over responsibility for their own security. I would have thought that is a commonsense thing for our troops to do. We still have some air traffic controllers there helping with the administration of Baghdad International Airport and they will stay there until the Iraqis can fulfil that function, and we have 86 soldiers who are protecting the Australian representative office in Iraq.As the House knows, a bomb went off recently near the Australian representative office. It was interesting to hear the Iraqi policeman say that the protection provided by the Australian troops makes it very difficult for any terrorists to attack the Australian mission itself. It is also noteworthy that HMAS Stuart was very effective in helping to protect Iraqi offshore oil assets recently. The Leader of the Opposition says that the troops there are just symbolic. He thinks they do not do anything important. I think Australians will resent that, because the troops are doing something very important. To leave now, as I explained the other day, or to leave in the middle of the year, would of course lead to the closure of our mission there, and I think that would be a bad idea.The member for Forde asked whether there are any alternative views. There are always the views of the member for Griffith, who has a view on everything and many views on the same thing, and those views can change from interview to interview. It takes a great commitment of time and energy by my office to maintain track of the words of the member for Griffith. Last week I explained that he did an interview with a German newspaper called Die Tages Zeitung. In that interview he said that under Labor there would be an early withdrawal of our troops, but last week he said he would get advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on whether our troops should stay and guard the embassy or whether our troops should leave. I got the advice for him, and the advice was that we would have to close our embassy without the troops.So what happened after that? The member for Griffith went on Lateline again - he gets a good run there - on 27 May, last Thursday night. On Lateline - I think honourable members would be interested to hear this - the member for Griffith agreed that the government was right to have troops in Iraq protecting our embassy. He said: If that is the advice Mr Downer has received - which you know it is, because I tabled it in the parliament last week - then that's an appropriate judgment for Mr Downer to make now.So the member for Griffith thinks it is right to have the troops there. He told Die Tages Zeitung that it was wrong to have troops there. A couple of weeks elapsed and it was right to have troops there.Interestingly enough, he even contradicts his leader's position on whether the troops should be out by Christmas. Let us be generous to the member for Griffith and say that he thinks the troops should be there now, but what about later on? On Lateline he said:All I'm saying is it's irresponsible for a politician - which I assume includes the Leader of the Opposition - to say six months in advance of a reality, this is precisely what the lay of the land will be then.In other words, the member for Griffith is leaving open the possibility that under Labor's policy they will not withdraw all the troops from Iraq; they will leave the 86 troops there to protect our mission - a reasonable proposition.It is hardly surprising that in the Australian Financial Review's colour magazine there was an article on the member for Griffith entitled `Destiny's Child', which is a very good title. By the way, I thought that some people on the other side have been saying some uncharitable things about the member for Griffith behind his back. I thought they were uncharitable. -  - Someone said `Shame'  - I agree. A lot of people in the Labor Party are following the Leader of the Opposition and his personal critique of the member for Griffith. The Financial Review said, `Rudd has to play follow-the-leader no matter how much damage is done to his credibility.' I think those words say it all. Last week in the parliament I raised the question of what the Leader of the Opposition's position was on the troops. I think we should be told. If the Leader of the Opposition were to become the Prime Minister of Australia, I think we are indeed all entitled to know whether the Leader of the Opposition agrees with the member for Griffith, or the Leader of the Opposition agrees with the member for Griffith before the recent statements by the member for Griffith, or whether the Leader of the Opposition even agrees with his own interview on 2GB, with Mike Carlton. The fact is that my own view of the Leader of the Opposition is that he actually believes in almost nothing except his own ego - almost nothing at all. The Leader of the Opposition, unlike Paul Keating or Gough Whitlam, is not one of politics' true believers; he is one of politics' true careerists. I think we are entitled to know from the Leader of the Opposition, if Labor were elected, what their position on the troops really is, because there is deep and dark confusion about that issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the -  - I thank the honourable member for the question, because it does give me the opportunity to point out, in relation to this very serious issue, that it has been a matter of note for some time. These reports occurred some four years ago, before the tragedy in New York and before the tragedy in Bali. It is the case - and it was reported publicly some two years ago - that ASIO was involved in a detailed internal investigation in response to those public claims in 2002 by Mr Roche, and they established then that they had not followed up on certain calls that were made. My predecessor was advised of that, and we were both given briefings by ASIO as to the steps that had been taken, following that outline.ASIO now has in place a systematic system of fall-back checking so that public calls will not be entirely dependent on just one or two people who might receive the call. These arrangements were instituted last year. There was an independent inquiry. The inquiry was undertaken by the former Inspector-General of Security and Intelligence, Ron McLeod, and he found that the new system was sound and appropriate, although he did make some minor suggestions which were implemented by ASIO in relation to this matter.As the Prime Minister said before, you cannot guarantee that there will never be human error, but I think ASIO is a particularly professional organisation. I think it does its job well. But the director-general recognises that this was a mistake on its part. The fact is that ASIO has had to deal with something in the order of 13,000 calls from members of the public since the National Security Hotline was instituted. Some of those have proved useful and are being followed up; others, of course, have not been entirely relevant. ASIO has to make some judgment calls in relation to those matters. But it is, I might say, drawing an extremely long bow to suggest that, if ASIO had been following that matter up at that time, it might have prevented the Bali bombings. There is no evidence, and there was no evidence adduced by Mr Roche in the trial, that suggested that he knew anything at that time about the Bali attacks.The question also asked for information in relation to the Australian Federal Police. I have said today in response to a number of interviews that I was unable to confirm that a call was made to the Singapore office of the AFP. In fact, the advice that I had received from the AFP - because I had sought specific advice from the AFP before I spoke to the media on this matter - was that there was no record of any call to the AFP. But I have been advised this afternoon that, on further checking, a person posted to Singapore in the year 2000 has today identified a diary note which may relate to the issue. According to that note, he received a voice mail message on 7 September 2000 from a man who identified himself as Ibrahim. The message, I am told, was non-specific but suggested that the caller had information of relevance to the AFP, and he left a phone number, requesting that his call be returned. The officer noted in his diary records that he attempted to return that call at 12.40 on the same day, that that attempt and subsequent efforts to raise someone on the number provided were unsuccessful and therefore that he was unable to speak to Ibrahim. The caller did not make - according to the advice I have been given - any further attempts to contact the AFP. I think these matters have been dealt with properly, appropriately and fully. They were in the public arena two years ago, when these issues could have been raised. As is normally the case, we have indicated to the Leader of the Opposition that, if he wishes to be briefed on these matters relating to national security, he can have a briefing in relation to them, and if he wants to satisfy himself as to the changes in procedures that have been outlined he can do that as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question. I can inform him that the government is forecasting continued economic growth in 2004-05. The government is forecasting that that will continue on low inflation and that unemployment will remain below six per cent - as low as it has been in the last 23 years. The government is also forecasting the seventh surplus since the government was elected in 1996. In fact, as at the end of the current financial year, we believe that in net terms we will have retired $70 billion of the $96 billion that had been accrued by the time Labor left office in 1996. That will reduce net debt to GDP from 19.1 per cent to 3.2 per cent. This is a very strong fiscal performance, and there are not many countries around the world that can boast, like Australia, continuing surpluses.The member for Macquarie asked whether this could be placed at risk by alternative proposals. Unfortunately, it could. It is quite noticeable that the Labor Party now has a tactic of not asking questions about the economy and not allowing the member for Hotham on his feet at the dispatch box anymore. In the course of this budget session, the Labor Party's criticism - to the extent that the Labor Party talked about the budget - has been that the tax cuts did not go far enough. That was the Australian Labor Party's position. If there was any doubt about that, the Leader of the Opposition stood up in his reply to the budget, on the Thursday after the budget, and said, `We will implement a bigger program of tax relief.' That could mean only one thing: the Labor Party believes that the tax cuts were not enough and that there should have been bigger tax cuts. Consequently, the Labor Party believes that the budget should have had more spending.That is why I was so surprised, when federal Labor criticised the government for not spending enough on tax cuts, to read the newspapers today and find that state Labor was criticising the government because the tax cuts were too large and too extensive. Just in case federal Labor was wrong and we had not gone far enough, state Labor decided that we were wrong because we had gone too far. It must have been a slow news day for the Financial Review, because their lead story was from the New South Wales Treasurer, Mr Egan. I was rather amused to read that Mr Egan said:... there is a danger that domestic rates could head higher, hurting activity in the property market ...Some mothers do have them, don't they? There could be problems in the New South Wales property market. Of course, it has got nothing to do with the new 2 per cent tax that the New South Wales government has just whipped on all investment properties - a proposal where you pay tax not only when you buy a property but also when you sell it. There was no mention of this from the New South Wales government before the last state election. I have always said: if you want to know what Labor would do if it were elected at a federal level, have a look at what Labor has done in the states. There was no talk about new taxes on property from Bob Carr before the last election. The thing that amazes me is that you can look in vain for a federal Labor MP who has criticised the new taxes of the Carr government. What an extraordinary proposition we are now getting out of the New South Wales Carr government - that property could turn down in New South Wales not because they have whacked a new tax, an exit tax, on all investment properties but because the federal government was reckless, according to Treasurer Michael Egan. Sooner or later, the media of Australia are going to hold the Labor Party accountable for what they say. Sooner or later, the media of Australia are going to say to the Leader of the Opposition: running Australia is a little bit more difficult than being mayor of Liverpool Council. Sooner or later they are going to wonder how it is that the Labor Party can promise greater tax relief without announcing their rates. When that scrutiny is put on, maybe they will have a look at the words of Senator Stephen Conroy on Meet the Press on Sunday. He was asked how they could do all of this and the question was, `Will you end up disappointing your supporters?' Stephen Conroy said this:I think our package will be fully funded. We will have broader and fairer tax cuts and we will have more in services and health and education than the Government are providing.Isn't that amazing? You can cut tax and spend more money at the same time; and, at the end of it, you have an intergenerational fund and a bigger surplus as well: the cut-and-come-again magic pudding of the member for Hotham and the Leader of the Opposition. As I have said before: you can take less, spend more, invest in an intergenerational fund and have more left over at the end of it. Why didn't we think of that? What have we been doing these last eight years? None of that adds up. You cannot do all of those things. The Labor policy is a fraud, and the Australian Labor Party's tax policies and family policies would do enormous damage to Australia. You would get the same outcome, because it is the same promise that was made down at the Liverpool Council, and that is that you could spend more and have more left over. The Liverpool Council is now in the hands of receivership.</DOC>

 - As I have indicated all along, I reiterate that the comments I have made in relation to this matter have all been based on advice that I have had from the defence department. I have also reiterated - and I reiterate again - that the first I and to my knowledge ministers knew of the serious abuse allegations was in April. Nothing that has come to my attention has altered that fact. I indicated to a television interviewer yesterday that, because of the different views that have been expressed by various people on this subject, I had sought a copy of the October report from the British and/or American governments. I have not seen the October report. To my knowledge -   - I was relying on the advice, as I said, of the defence department. This is an extraordinary proposition. I was not in Baghdad. I was not there. I have not seen the report. Everything that I have said to date is based on what the defence department has told me. I was informed shortly before question time that the defence department now has in its possession some documents that have been described as working drafts or working papers. I have not had an opportunity to analyse them and I do not intend to say anything further about that until I have. But I repeat: everything I have said on this matter has been based on the advice of the defence department. It can be none other.Can I also take the opportunity of saying yet again that it is perfectly legitimate for the opposition and, indeed, the media to ask questions about the time at which knowledge was acquired by people in the Australian Defence Force and when knowledge was acquired by ministers. That is a perfectly legitimate exercise. I am satisfied that, as soon as the ministers were aware of these serious abuse allegations, the appropriate statements of disgust and abhorrence were made on behalf of the government.I have to take this opportunity again of saying this, because it may not seep through to everybody in the Australian community: none of these abuse allegations in any way involve the behaviour of members of the Australian Defence Force. At no stage have members of the Australian Defence Force been in any way involved. We totally repudiate any suggestion of that and the implication. Every time one of these allegations is made, the television cameras reproduce those appalling photographs. When allegations are made about the knowledge of the ADF and these appalling photographs are produced, it is my obligation as the head of the government to say this again and again on behalf of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force, who have behaved impeccably, and also, incidentally, on behalf of the 138,000 or 139,000 members of the American army serving in Iraq who have also behaved in a totally professional manner.There has been appalling misbehaviour by a small number of people. To the great credit of the United States, something is being done to bring the perpetrators to justice. In my view, that reflects favourably upon the United States and I do not believe that the misdeeds of a few should besmirch the fine reputations of fighting men and women in both armies.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and note her particular interest in the speculation of the last few days. The government's policy is settled and has not changed. In a nutshell, Sydney does not need a second airport in the foreseeable future and there is no point in looking for one. Indeed, it would be very bad public policy in my view to go and try to find a site now and seek to build one -   - The member for Lowe just said in an aside that they are going to find a site and build it. The reason that it would be bad policy to do so at the moment - and he is nodding - is that we do not know if it will be needed or when it will be needed if it were to be needed. The real danger is that, in making a decision now in the absence of those critical factors as to whether you would need it and where you might build it, the chances are that you would build a complete and absolute white elephant at vast cost to the taxpayer, and one which would not be used by the travelling public.Despite all of this and the commonsense position that the government has taken up, on the basis of information made public last week the Labor Party are quite intent on finding a site for the second airport that Sydney does not need. It is also the case, we now know, that they have almost certainly chosen the airport site and made up their minds that they want to build it. -  - `Not true', we hear, but the member for Lowe says it is true. We now know, thanks to the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales lodging an FOI request, that quite a bit of detailed information has been sought, assembled and put together for the Labor Party. The Leader of the Opposition lodged the freedom of information application, attached the required fee and requested:... all file notes, emails, reports or other documents relating to discussions regarding possible locations for a second Sydney airport or any planning or future land use issues relating to Wilton, Sutton Forest, Berrima or Wells Creek in Wingecarribee or Wollondilly shires held between the honourable Craig Knowles or his staff and the federal opposition leader and his staff or designated agents.They have made a lot of talk over there about how they would be consulting with their New South Wales colleagues. Shortly after that, back came the reply from the relevant FOI officer:I have this day determined - it says in part - that full access be granted to the information you requested.Full access!Please find attached one document detailing the information pertinent to your application.As to the one document, what is it? A very detailed exploration of the possibility of Sutton Park is what it is, setting out all of the reasons why it ought to be built at Sutton Park. -  - It is Sutton Forest, I beg your pardon. In response to this, the New South Wales government initially said that it did the work because the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning wanted to know what sites were available - he was curious. But, this morning, there was a report that the work was done because the federal Labor opposition asked for an airport site outside the Sydney basin. Interestingly, of course, this work was done in January, just before that conference where they said they would identify a site and then at the conference said they were not going to. Then we see, at federal level, the opposition transport spokesman admitting that he has been talking to the New South Wales minister about alternative sites but saying that he has not seen the one document that is germane to the whole thing.The Labor Party cannot possibly expect us to believe all of this nonsense. The people of the Southern Highlands deserve to know whether or not this really is their secret plan for an airport - whether this is what they are going to do. It is not only the people of the Southern Highlands; the taxpayers need to know as well. The estimated cost of an airport like this is around $3 billion - the Treasurer would like to know, I am sure. But not only that: it needs to be recognised that Sutton Forest is 130 kilometres from Sydney. The document makes the claim that New South Wales would need a bit of help with the additional infrastructure - there is a light rail at the cost of about $3 billion and a complete upgrade of the highways. The Treasurer might like to add this to the magic pudding - the lower taxes, the more spending, the better services, the bigger surplus and the intergenerational retirement plan. You can now add around $5 billion or $6 billion for this. And I note this morning mention of the Pacific Highway as well. But, in the end, the Leader of the Opposition has to demonstrate some public policy integrity on all of this. He has to rule out the Sutton site, rule it in and tell us how they will fund it or admit that Labor have no intention of building a second airport and that their policy is just a pretence to the anti-airport lobbies of inner Sydney that Labor are on their side. As I looked at all of this this morning, it occurred to me that I am one of those Australian parents - I think it is about 96 per cent - who actually read to their children without having to have a government instruction from the nanny state to tell them to do it. One of my children had a favourite character: a dog whose name was What-a-Mess. He was one of those lovable characters that was always trying to do the right thing but, every time he tried to resolve a mess, he made the mess worse. I reckon that the member for Werriwa has been reading What-a-Mess to the member for Batman, and that is how they came up with this airport policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question, because it does give me the opportunity to provide some information to the House on the number of children adopted both from overseas and locally. In the year 2002-03 there were 78 adoptions within Australia. In that same year, there were 278 overseas adoptions that were arranged under the bilateral agreements between countries or under the Hague convention. The issue of adoption is obviously a very important one. It is important because the number of children available for adoption here and abroad is very limited. There are always many more families who seek to adopt children than can ever be accommodated. The fact is that we are dealing with situations which, if you saw some of the comments from the Leader of the Opposition, one would believe ought to be automatically accommodated. I quote the Leader of the Opposition from a radio program on 2GB today on this matter: In general, all other things being equal, adopted children are far better off with a mum and a dad. And, if the world was perfect, that would always be the outcome you would be seeking. But in the imperfect world, a lot of unique and difficult circumstances, we think, have always been handled case by case in the best interests of the child.I simply make the point that this is not a matter for the states; this is a matter in which the Australian government determines who will be able to come and settle in Australia.  - There are arrangements for recognised programs on a bilateral basis which are supervised by the states in determining whether or not parents are suitable for adoption.  - It is in that context that we know the best interests of children are served by having both role models available to them, and the Leader of the Opposition has suggested that that is important. We know there is a shortage of children available for adoption, yet there are some people who would want to put that program at risk by prioritising, over and above couples who are wanting to adopt children, those in same-sex relationships. This would put at risk an international program. Governments abroad would say, if you were doing that -  - `We are not going to allow our children to enter into a program that is pursued by Australia.' It would be clearly against Australia's interests to have state governments determining that homosexual couples should have priority over married available parents seeking to adopt children. I go back to the words of the Leader of the Opposition, because they were very germane:In general, all other things being equal, adopted children are better off with a mum and dad.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wills for his question. I am glad he is following the papers. I am glad he has noted that the government will be having a number of things to say about longer-term policy in relation to the environment. It gives me an opportunity of saying something about the wonderful environmental record of the government over the last 8½ years. It enables me to remind the member for Wills that he talks about the Murray-Darling, but the most significant thing that has been done in relation to that issue in recent times is the national water initiative, which was brought before the Council of Australian Governments by the Commonwealth government. I have to acknowledge the tremendous work of the Deputy Prime Minister and the leader of The Nationals, because he has been the driving force behind that. I can tell the member for Wills this: you will be hearing something about future environmental policy from the government. I can assure him that, to the extent that our policy and the policies of the opposition are the same, it will not be a bad thing, because in all of these areas there is no harm in coincidence - there is no harm in great minds thinking alike.But I can promise him one thing: there is a big difference between us on this side of the House in the government and those who sit opposite in the Australian Labor Party. We believe it is possible to preserve the Australian environment without crippling our resource industries. We believe it is possible to reach the Kyoto target of 108 on the benchmark date in relation to Australia, without at the same time betraying Australian resource industries, by signing a protocol that would disadvantage Australia as compared to countries such as China, Indonesia and Brazil that could very readily be our competitors in relation to investment and markets. In other words, we can pursue a bright environmental future for Australia without the high economic costs that would be imposed by many of the policies that have been advocated by the Australian Labor Party. There is only one side of politics in Australia that can be trusted simultaneously with the environmental and economic future of Australia, and that is the Liberal Party and The Nationals.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question and I congratulate him on spending an adult lifetime trying to promote better health outcomes for the people of Perth - both as a doctor in Perth and as a member of this House. As the member for Moore well knows, the Howard government's brand new Medicare safety net is the biggest structural improvement to our Medicare system since it commenced in 1984. Already, more than 200,000 Australians are enjoying higher Medicare rebates thanks to the new system. They have benefited to the tune of $7½ million already - $7½ million to the sickest and most vulnerable people in this country as a result of the Howard government's brand new safety net. I have been asked about alternative policies. The policy of the Labor Party - the great health heist of 2004 - is to rip the guts out of the Howard government's brand new safety net. I have here a quote from the member for Lalor, who said on Meet the Press:We won't be operating this sham safety net arrangement. Then, of course, we have none other than the Leader of the Opposition, who wants to take money off people in the safety net and fund the pneumococcal vaccination. The only political party in this parliament that wants to actually take money away from any health program is not the Liberal Party, The Nationals, the Democrats or the Greens - it is the Australian Labor Party, which thinks that you can rip benefits off one group of people to give them to another. This government is about putting more money into the Medicare system; it is not about taking money out.The Labor Party's policy to abolish the Medicare safety net means real hardship to real people. For instance, there is a retiree with a brain tumour. She has received $720 under the safety net already, and that would be gone under Labor. There is a pensioner with suspected prostate cancer. He has received $230 already under the safety net - that would be gone under Labor. There is a couple expecting their first child. They have received $445 already under the safety net - that would be gone under Labor. It is a pretty odd Labor Party that wants to rip off the pensioners, the retirees and the expectant mums of this country. The message is going out: look at the fine print; and the fine print says, `You will pay more for your health if there is ever a Labor government elected.'</DOC>

 - This government takes very seriously the responsibility of sending a very strong signal to those who have engaged in the past practice of people-smuggling - of attempting to bring people to Australia by means which challenge our orderly migration process. This government has used a range of mechanisms that send strong signals to those people-smugglers that that range of activities no longer guarantees an outcome. - As a result, this government has been able to see a real decrease in the number of people coming to this country by unlawful means. The Australian Labor Party, on the other side of the equation, stands for a soft approach on people-smuggling. The Australian Labor Party wants to send a green light to this industry that, if it should happen to be elected, after the next election they can be back in business - and we can start seeing children loaded onto boats to take their chances on the high seas; we can start to see people trying to force their way into the Australian community and at the same time bringing into disrepute all people who come in an orderly way through the migration system. It is important that the Australian people understand very clearly that the Australian Labor Party and its competing agenda on this particular issue are a threat to the integrity of our migration system and a threat to the integrity of the good standing of all people who pass lawfully through it. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. Coming from South Australia, he is particularly keen to see the passage of this agreement through the US Congress and of the enabling legislation through this parliament so that his constituents can benefit from some of the programs that will fall out of the agreement and, of course, from the jobs that will be created in his electorate in South Australia.The report is out from CIE, the Centre for International Economics, that indicates that this agreement could deliver a $6 billion boost to the bottom line of Australia. It also indicates that it could generate another 30,000 jobs in the Australian economy. It indicates that it would give us a historic opportunity to access a market of 300 million consumers. This has been well recognised by many groups across Australia since the detail of the agreement became public after the negotiations in January and February this year. Of course, industry and business support this deal; the farmers support it; the seafood industry supports it; business groups support it; manufacturers support it; Medicines Australia and the Pharmacy Guild support it; and even state Labor governments have indicated their support for this agreement - all the state Labor governments have indicated their support.I found reported in media recently on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales that the Labor trade spokesman actually supports it. It is reported in the Great Lakes Advocate that Senator Conroy - Senator Conroy again; I know he was mentioned earlier in question time - when he was in my electorate was attending a meeting that had been organised by, I think, people from One Nation, maybe, because the report in the paper comes from those people. He was asked if Labor supported the free trade agreement, and Senator Conroy said, `Yes, we do.' That was reported in a piece in the Great Lakes Advocate, and the piece went on to say that about 60 concerned citizens from throughout the New South Wales North Coast heard the senator and the Labor candidate for Lyne confirm that they will continue to support the Australia-United States free trade agreement if Labor should win government in the forthcoming elections.We still have not heard from the Leader of the Opposition, though. We have heard from everybody else. We have heard from industry. We have heard from all the interested stakeholders. We have heard from the state Labor governments. We have heard from the trade spokesman for the Labor Party. We have not heard from the Leader of the Opposition on this, as the voice of the Labor Party. We have not heard from him whether they will support an agreement that will deliver a significant boost to the Australian economy and will create an opportunity of generating an extra 30,000 jobs in the Australian economy. We need to ask ourselves why. We need to ask ourselves whether, as some commentators very unkindly say, it is his natural anti-American attitude.</DOC>

 - I will resist the urge to tell the member for Lilley when the election is going to be held. - You would like to know first, yes. I am not aware of what has been said in Senate estimates, but I am aware that as a result of the budget every eligible family will be $1,200 a child better off this year. - Nothing alters that fact, not even the fervent and tortured efforts of the member for Lilley to suggest otherwise can alter that simple fact. I will just repeat it very slowly so the member for Lilley can take it in. You get $600 before 30 June in relation to the eligible child. My advice is that those payments are going to be made some time between about the middle and the end of June, because the legislation has gone through. My further understanding is that, in relation to the next $600, you have to put it in your tax return and then you have a reconciliation. It has never been suggested that there would not first be a reconciliation and then the extra amount. Obviously, if there is a liability, that liability will be offset. - He is complaining there is no clawback. Can I also take the opportunity of reminding the Leader of the Opposition -  - I am glad the member for Lilley interjects; I think he actually helps me. He does not intend to, but he does. Per misadventure, he reminds me of something I have in my file. What I have in this file says - and these are very interesting figures, and I think everybody in the House will want to hear them - that, as at March 2004, just under 1.7 FTB families have had their 2002-03 FTB reconciled. Of these families, 478,366 or 28 per cent have received a top up. - No, a top up - something that did not exist under the Australian Labor Party. - No, Mr Speaker, I warm to the member for Lilley; he encourages me on these things. There are 469,904 who have incurred an overpayment and there are 748,364 who have not been changed. Even with my feeble maths, if you add the 44 per cent and the 28 per cent together, I think you have 72 per cent who either have no change or who receive a top up. That indicates that the reconciliation results for 2002-03 are an improvement on the outcomes for the previous year. I am told that 10.2 per cent more families have received a top up for 2002-03. Not only do we provide top ups but there are more of them under our policies. Some 13.5 per cent fewer families have incurred an overpayment for 2002 than for 2001-02. What this shows is that, quite apart from the additional $1,200 to which each eligible child will become entitled -   - The member for Lilley shakes his head and thinks that somehow or other you can shake away $1,200. - I do not think many families are going to shake $1,200 away. They might, when they work it out and when it comes, shake you away, but they are not going to shake away the value of this budget for Australian families. In relation to their entitlements, there will be an additional eligibility of $1,200 for every child. Nothing the member for Lilley can say alters that fact.It has been a very good budget for Australian families. Can I point out to the member for Lilley that the benefits are going to flow. They are going to start flowing in the middle of next month, and what I think the people who receive those will want to know is whether they have an absolute guarantee that, if there were a change of government - whenever the election is held - they could be certain they would continue to get that extra $1,200. That is what they are going to be interested in. They are not going to be so worried about top ups and reconciliations; they are going to be worried about snatch aways. They are going to be worried as to whether any of that $1,200 is going to be taken away - and the inability, day after day, of the Leader of the Opposition to spell out what he intends to do on taxation and family benefits will only feed the anxiety of average Australian families.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question. I am aware of the fact that there are those promoting emissions trading schemes for Australia to address the issue of climate change - among them the Leader of the Opposition and the Premier of New South Wales. Last week in a speech, the Leader of the Opposition attempted to argue that an emissions trading scheme would be good for business. An emissions trading scheme - and this is for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition - operates like a carbon tax. The Leader of the Opposition appears to be working under the delusion that a scheme to increase the cost of production for our major industries is actually great for the Australian economy. He seems to ignore the fact that increased costs mean higher prices, fewer jobs, hardship for families and fewer rungs on the ladder of opportunity.Why would the Leader of the Opposition want to impose this extra cost on Australian industry? It certainly is not in order to reach our internationally agreed target for greenhouse abatement, because we are going to reach that target anyway. So why does the Leader of the Opposition want to impose this extra cost? At least, instead of pretending that it is a benefit, he ought to admit that it is actually a cost - because the Victorian government recently received a report from Allen Consulting which made this point very clearly. As the Australian reported on 19 May:A carbon trading scheme designed to reduce greenhouse gases would knock out 15,000 jobs, slash the national economy and lead to an explosion in power prices, secret modelling for the Victorian Government has found. So here we have the extraordinary situation where the Leader of the Opposition believes that a new tax burden on Australian business is going to be good for the economy, when an expert report to the Victorian government shows that it will actually cut economic growth and cause the loss of perhaps some 15,000 jobs. As well as that, the report indicated that it could put up electricity prices by some 27 per cent. If electricity prices were to go up by 27 per cent, that would be a $203 per annum increase in electricity bills for every household in Victoria; $209 extra in New South Wales; $224 extra in Queensland; $193 extra in Western Australia; $289 extra in Tasmania; and $303 extra in South Australia.This is the cost of the Leader of the Opposition's commitment to an emissions trading scheme. It will only disadvantage Australian families. It will destroy jobs. It will be an extra burden on Australian industry. It will knock a further series of rungs out of the ladder of opportunity. Maybe the Leader of the Opposition thinks the way you make the magic pudding deliver is to put up taxes and then that speeds up economic growth and you have more to spend. The reality is, as every piece of expert evidence shows, that this will destroy jobs and undermine economic growth. Why does he want to do it? For shabby political reasons: to buy Green preferences. If the Leader of the Opposition thinks we need to go further than our already agreed international target, he should tell us so or abandon this crazy policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the opposition leader very warmly for asking me a question about higher education. I understand that the title of the Labor Party's higher education policy in this country is Aim Higher. I am going to take a copy of that policy with me when I call on the British Prime Minister in the next few days and I am going to compare the title. I think that, purely by accident, it is the same - it is Aim Higher. It is purely accidental. It would not be deliberate, because there is no similarity between the policies' substance. On this occasion the only thing that the Leader of the Opposition plagiarised was the title.He did not plagiarise the substance because the reality is that the Third Way Tony Blair approach to higher education is essentially the same as the approach of this government and indeed the same as the approach that Labor adopted when Labor was last in office. The introduction of HECS was supported at the time by the coalition because we recognised, as Labor did then, that you could no longer hold out to the Australian public the essentially fraudulent proposition that tertiary education could be free. That had been tried by the Whitlam government - we all remember the Whitlam government - and it had been proved an expensive failure.What I can confirm are a number of facts. I can confirm that, when all of the government's changes are fully operational, the total contribution of a student through HECS to an average degree will be 28 per cent. In other words, 72 per cent of the cost is being borne by the general community and 28 per cent is being borne by the student. I can confirm that, from 1 July 2004, the minimum HECS repayment threshold will increase to $35,000. In other words, until you earn $35,000 you do not have to start paying back the 28 per cent of the cost of the degree. I can also inform the House that, in 2002, less than one per cent of all domestic undergraduates were in full fee courses costing more than $50,000. Our changes have provided opportunity and flexibility for the universities. Our changes have got more money into universities. Our changes balance the interests and rights of students against the interests and rights of taxpayers. Instead of railing against the sensible changes that we have introduced, I would invite the Leader of the Opposition to rail against the scandalous and obscene increases in TAFE charges that have been introduced by Labor governments around Australia - in some cases, 300 and 400 per cent. Yet do you hear a word from the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa? No - you do not criticise Bob Carr or Peter Beattie, because they belong to the Labor Party, just as, in relation to Iraq, the Leader of the Opposition delights in criticising George Bush but he never utters a word of criticism of Tony Blair.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for her question. I am aware of views expressed by some of those opposite, and other people in the community, which suggest that Australia should not have a very close relationship with the United States. Amongst other explanations for that is that it damages our relations with Asia. Let the House be absolutely clear of the government's view. At a time of great international uncertainty, Australia's close relationship with the United States is vital to our security. The United States's engagement in the security architecture of the Asia-Pacific region is vital to the stability of the Asia-Pacific region.One of the great myths being pushed by the opposition is that we should downgrade our relationship with the United States in order to upgrade our relations with Asia. Our strong relationship with Asia is there for all to see: free trade agreements with Thailand and Singapore - interestingly enough, the Labor Party has chosen not to criticise those free trade agreements; the support of the ASEAN economic ministers for the creation of an ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand free trade area; the offer from the ASEAN economic ministers to the Australian and New Zealand prime ministers to attend an ASEAN summit meeting later this year; and a trade and economic framework agreement with China, including a joint study now being undertaken on the feasibility of a free trade agreement. We are able to do all of these things and have a close relationship with the United States. The other myth, of course, that is pushed by the opposition is that somehow the fact that Australia has troops in Iraq damages us in Asia. This just demonstrates a complete failure to understand Asia, a complete lack of knowledge of Asia. The fact is that a number of Asian countries join Australia in having troops in Iraq: Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, the Philippines - and, indeed, in the presence of the Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives, let me remind the House that New Zealand has troops in Iraq, and they are very welcome there.The truth is that our alliance with the United States strengthens Australia in Asia; it does not weaken Australia in Asia. Of course, we do not agree with the Americans on everything: we have been aggressively arguing our case with the Americans on the issue of farm subsidies, we have taken a different course from the United States on the comprehensive test ban treaty and we have signed the statute of the International Criminal Court. But the Labor Party, under the current Leader of the Opposition, continually attack the United States on absolutely everything. They are opposed to the United States's policy on missile defence. They are opposed to the Proliferation Security Initiative. They are opposed to the free trade agreement. They are opposed to us being involved in trying to bring stability and democracy to Iraq. They are opposed to anything to do with the United States. I notice that, in a speech on 27 May to the Sydney Institute, the member for Griffith said that Labor's views on negotiating an arrangement with the Americans on the International Criminal Court, which is called an article 98(2) agreement, was `unacceptable in the extreme' because it would render `Americans guilty of grave breaches of the Geneva conventions ... immune from prosecution in Australia'. That statement by the member for Griffith, who is always ready to accuse others of being dishonest and lying, is completely untrue and it is utterly misleading. For the member for Griffith to say that Americans, under an article 98 agreement, would have immunity from prosecution in Australia is false. Americans enjoy no immunity from prosecution in Australia now, nor would they under an article 98(2) agreement. Any agreement that we concluded would be consistent with our International Criminal Court obligations and would allow us to try US citizens in Australian courts for war crimes or any other types of crimes against Australian law. The member for Griffith has gone out and deliberately misled the Australian people in order to promote Labor's anti-American agenda, which of course is the Leader of the Opposition's agenda. - He does not like to hear it; he has asked for a point of order to be raised. He does not like to be reminded of his visceral anti-Americanism. - There is no doubt about it: the Labor Party, including the Leader of the Opposition, will get up here, and particularly go out into the Australian community, and accuse the government of lying over any manner of things. And that is their standard. But, when it comes to them being criticised for making statements which are manifestly untrue, apparently they would rather have silence. They would rather shut everybody up when they expose the weakness of their arguments. I am sorry; this anti-Americanism is not going to wash with the Australian public.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. Honourable members will recall that last week I advised the House that under the government's higher education reforms, in addition to $1.8 billion of taxpayers' money being invested in universities over the next four years, my department's initial analysis was that at that time - that is, last week -  - the 17 universities that had decided to increase HECS from five per cent to 25 per cent could expect to receive $377 million in additional revenue over the next four years. In fact, my department has spent the last week further analysing this information. When the department takes into account the students who are currently in the system who are not affected by this, then in fact today, with 18 universities having decided to increase HECS, eight of them deciding not to increase HECS at all and 13 yet to decide, a total of $662 million of additional money will go into universities over the next four years as a result of this government's policies. - That means that for every extra dollar that the students invest, not as students but once they have graduated and are, as the Prime Minister said, working and earning in excess of $35,000 a year, the taxpayer will have invested an extra $3. Every last dollar of HECS, of course, goes to universities to benefit the educations of the students. The taxpayer pays it up front and then the graduate pays back just over a quarter of the cost of his or her university study once they have graduated.It is interesting that the Labor Party has said through the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that it will fully compensate universities for this $662 million. In fact, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said to Brian Toohey on Meet the Press on 18 April this year that it was in the Labor Party's policy. Today, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is quoted in the Courier-Mail:Ms Macklin said universities would be fully compensated for losing the HECs rises through indexation and through Labor's $450 million 'University of the 21st Century' fund. Page 24 of the Labor Party's policy is headed `Costings' and contains costings for the Labor Party's policy. The Labor Party says that its policy is costed at $2.34 billion over the first four years. So today, before 13 universities have made a decision about HECS over the next four years, we are looking for $662 million.The line in the Labor Party policy says `oppose HECS increases ... $15 million.' In fact, that day the Deputy Leader of the Opposition issued a media release and said that that had nothing to do with compensating for HECS increases. Today, in the Courier-Mail, we are told that this $662 million is going to be found from indexation. Indexation in the Labor Party policy is $312 million. That is a long way short of the $662 million. So the $312 million goes out of the policy - I will give that page to the Treasurer, who is sitting behind me.So the Labor Party's $2.34 billion is minus $312 million. They have got $312 million from indexation that is apparently going to fund the compensation to the universities. Then they say $450 million is going to come from this Universities of the 21st Century fund. That is 80 per cent of their policy gone on compensating universities - I will give that page to the Treasurer as well. What that means is that the Labor Party, before they even start funding universities, will have to find $662 million to fully compensate universities, which brings them back to a $1.6 billion policy. The Minister for Finance and Administration and the Department of Finance and Administration have already found a $370 million hole in Labor's policy. That means that over -  - That means that over the next four years Australian universities will receive $2.4 billion from this government as a result of the policies of this government; they will receive $1.3 billion from the Australian Labor Party. If the Leader of the Opposition is incapable of funding a higher education policy and costing it, how on earth is he going to run Australia?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. Members may not know that the honourable member for Boothby is a medical doctor, so it is not surprising he would ask a question about the international reaction to Australia's leading efforts on tobacco control. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition asked a question about anti-smoking. It seemed to me that that question rather indicated that the Leader of the Opposition had no idea what Australia had been doing in terms of anti-smoking campaigns and what the international community thought of our campaigns. The World Health Organisation put out a press release a few years ago saying a major factor in Australia's second highest life expectancy rates was:... smoking rates have dropped sharply from their earlier peaks ...The World Health Organisation estimates that the prevalence rates of smoking in Australia are 19.5 per cent, compared to Germany, 34.5 per cent; France, 27 per cent; Canada, 21.7 per cent; New Zealand, 24.9 per cent - too much smoking still going on in New Zealand; and the United States of America, which is a very important country in all of this, 23.3 per cent. It is higher in the United States of America than in Australia. The World Health Organisation also said a couple of years ago:Australia is a proven leader in tobacco within the Western Pacific Region.It also said of Australia: In 1997 the National Tobacco Campaign was launched. This sustained, coordinated national activity has been successful ...Now listen to this - this is what the World Health Organisation says:Components of the campaign have been ... used by ... Canada ... New Zealand ... Singapore, United Kingdom, and the United States of America.I mention the United States of America because I went back to my office yesterday and wondered why the Leader of the Opposition had asked a question about smoking, and I found out why: because the Leader of the Opposition - and I was asked for alternative views - has a handbook on which all these so-called soft questions are based. I brought it in with me. It is called Behind the Oval Office: Getting Reelected Against the Odds, by Dick Morris, President Clinton's chief strategist. It is an interesting book to read. I commend it to all members of the House. I look for the price. This version comes from the DFAT library; it does not have a price on it, but taxpayers must have paid for this one. On page 217, Dick says in his explanation of how President Clinton's campaign should be run:Tobacco would be our first effort.On page 215 he says:On tobacco I was a zealot. I fought hard to extend the values and agenda - of President Clinton - to include a ban on advertising.I am sorry to say that the story does not stop there. On page 230 of this book, Dick Morris says that a good strategy is to introduce a curfew for teenagers. Does that sound familiar to anyone? Page 38 - the Treasurer will be interested in this - says, `Let's cut government programs,' and page 81 says, `Propose a tax cut.' But the grand-daddy of them all is page 231, where Dick Morris calls for a massive program to ensure that children could read - interesting. It is a funny coincidence that from smoking to almost anything else, the Leader of the Opposition's strategy can be found in this book. The final chapter of this book is the chapter I suggest the Leader of the Opposition might choose to read as well. That chapter is called `Downfall'. I think he might find that an excellent chapter.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I point out to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the University of Ballarat will receive a minimum $6.8 million in core funding as a result of this government's higher education reforms, before it accesses any of the performance based funding pools, as a part of the $2.6 billion five-year program. I also say to the member for Ballarat that she and every member on the other side voted against that. I will also be making sure that the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Ballarat is fully aware of the consequences of the Labor Party policy - a $1 billion deficit in funding - which is underfunded. The Labor Party has been advising universities that they will be fully compensated for at least $662 million for HECS changes over the next four years at the same time as deceiving the Australian taxpayer into believing that the policy is fully funded. I also take this opportunity to remind the House that HECS is a system where the student - not as a student, but once the student has graduated - pays back his or her 25 per cent share of the cost of their education through the tax system. The Australian taxpayers, the vast majority of whom have never seen the inside of a university, will continue to pay for almost three-quarters of the cost of a university education. The House ought to be reminded that the average HECS debt in Australia at the moment is $8,500. Ninety per cent of people who owe the taxpayer money for HECS owe less than $18,000. A university graduate has a lifetime unemployment rate that is a quarter of the rate of someone who has not been to university. In their very first year of working after graduation, even after all of these changes, in every single case - with the exception of law - the university graduate will earn more than their entire HECS debt could possibly be under these changes. As the British Prime Minister said, it is free at the point of entry, it is fair at the point of repayment and every last dollar goes to the university to benefit the education of those students.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. I welcome the interest that he shows in family policy, because as far as the government is concerned families are the building blocks of our society, and we want to make sure that they are kept strong. He asked me what people could do to ensure that they get their benefits. There will be an additional $600 per child paid before 30 June this month to all of those families who are eligible for the family tax benefit part A. If there are families who are worried that they have not received it yet - we are not expecting it to be paid until about the middle of the month - they could call the fax-phone number on 13 61 50, they could access the web site or, if they have any doubt about their entitlement, they could ring their local federal MP to find out about their benefits. Or, in Labor electorates, they could ring coalition senators to make sure that they are properly informed as to their entitlements. - I am not sure that there would be any point in ringing the local Labor MP because the Labor Party seems to be so opposed to these additional benefits. Can you imagine if you rang up in the electorate of Braddon, Mr Speaker, to ask about the benefits of a coalition budget? You would get a harangue on the other end of the phone, but you would not get much information. - It is not just $600 per child that families can be receiving, because the increase is an additional $600 per child per annum -  - The government, of course, has also changed eligibility for family tax benefits in respect of the income test and the taper test. I ask the House to follow me in relation to this example. A family where the father is on $40,000 - about average earnings - and where the mother is working part time on an income of around $10,000, with two children, one under five, on an annual basis would receive an additional $1,200 per annum - that is, $600 per child. Because of the changes in the taper rate, they would get an additional $965 under family tax benefit A, and because of the changes in the taper rate for family tax benefit B they would get an additional $1,252. When all of these entitlements are introduced in full, that family would be entitled to an additional $3,417 per year. They are the benefits that are delivered to that family. As many of us know, it is becoming much more common for mothers with young children to go back into the work force on a part-time basis. Our changes to the family tax benefit part B will encourage that. That cameo of a family would be better off by $3,417 per year.In addition, this government wants to introduce a superannuation co-contribution so that, if that family were to make payments - and both the father and the mother could make payments into superannuation - they would get 150 per cent of the contribution that they make. Why would any political party oppose such a policy? Why are the Australian Labor Party opposing a proposal which would give a family like that an additional benefit of 150 per cent of any money that they contribute to superannuation? It is one thing to say that you want to support families that are earning $30,000 or $40,000, but when it comes to votes in this parliament, if that were in fact your position, why would you vote down a co-contribution scheme? Yet I do not know that it has dawned on the Labor Party backbench. Following the member for Werriwa, they are voting down a superannuation co-contribution for those families. They are opposing the superannuation co-contribution. - The Australian Labor Party is opposing a 150 per cent proposal -  - for low-income earners in relation to superannuation contribution. - As the foreign minister says, `It's not in the Dick Morris book.' What other reason could there be for taking such a position?I was then asked this question: what can families do to guarantee they keep their entitlements? I want to make this point: the Australian Labor Party has not agreed to keep the benefits which the government has introduced under the family tax benefits. It has said that it will vote them through. The Australian Labor Party has said they will apply in 2004-05, but the Australian Labor Party does not guarantee those benefits thereafter. That has been made entirely clear by the member for Fraser and, indeed, made clear by the member for Kingston, who said that this money was not quarantined - they were his words - with the intention that they could be taken back. Why would the Australian Labor Party want to take these benefits back? It is all so obvious. The Australian Labor Party has made a number of unfunded promises which cannot be paid for. The Australian Labor Party says that it is going to introduce new tax cuts for everybody - and we wait with bated breath to see the dimension of those tax cuts. The Australian Labor Party also says it is going to spend more in various areas of government expenditure. The Australian Labor Party says that, after taxing less and spending more, it is going to have more left over at the end of it. That is why Labor members are enviously eyeing these family tax benefits.  I want to say this to that family where dad earns $40,000 and mum earns $10,000 in part-time work: that additional benefit of $3,417 is under threat from a Labor election victory. Until such time as the Australian Labor Party can announce a policy, it runs from scrutiny. Here we are with the Leader of the Opposition running the small target strategy. That is what essentially he is doing: the small target strategy. He will not put out any tax policies or any family policies or any funding policies. He is trying to run this small target strategy - the strategy which he himself decried - because he is hoping that the media will not put him under any scrutiny. We say this: the Australian Labor Party is entitled to take away those family tax benefits and it is entitled to take away those tax cuts, just like it is trying to take away those superannuation benefits, but only on the basis that it comes clean before the election. It is only entitled to do that if it is honest with the Australian people before the election. That is why the Leader of the Opposition will come under increasing media scrutiny over the weeks ahead - because he knows these promises of all things to all men and women cannot be delivered and the Australian public demand to know the truth. </DOC>

 - I have already indicated that there were reports sent through to officials in departments in Canberra from Iraq prior to April. But what I have said before and what I repeat is that until April I as Prime Minister and, as I understand it, relevant ministers as ministers were not aware or conscious of the serious criminal abuses which have been exemplified and typified by the publication of those photographs. Can I take the opportunity of saying also to the House that all the comments I have made on this matter have been based on advice I have received from the Department of Defence. I do not have direct personal knowledge and nor could anybody reasonably expect me to have had direct personal knowledge.  - Just on the question of knowledge, could I make this point: I visited Baghdad on 25 April. When I was in Baghdad, I met not only the commanding officer of the Australian Defence Force in the Iraqi region; I also met the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority, Mr Bremer; I met the head of Central Command, General Abizaid; I met General Ricardo Sanchez; and I spoke to a large number of Australian defence personnel. I was accompanied by a number of journalists. There was no mention to me by anybody of the prisoner abuse issue, and this was on 25 April. I would have thought that, if knowledge of this matter were around beyond a very, very small number of people - and I am talking here of the Australian side - and if the Americans regarded this as something that in any way involved the Australians, then the matter would have been raised with me by General Abizaid or General Sanchez. But it was not. That goes to the issue of my state of knowledge on 25 April and is certainly consistent with the assertion that I have made. I did indicate in the House yesterday - and I say this for the purposes of completeness of that answer - that the defence department had in its possession some documents described as working drafts or working papers. I have now been briefed on these papers. I am told by the defence department that the working papers of October-November last year do indeed cover advice previously given to me by the department - that is, that they are largely a discussion of prison conditions and possibilities for improvement or amelioration. However, I have now been told that the documents also canvassed allegations of unacceptable treatment of prisoners. I have been informed by the defence department that these documents were handed over by Major O'Kane to the department on 11 May - although one had been with the department since February - and that their content was considered systematically by the department for the first time over the last few days. They were then drawn to Senator Hill's attention over the weekend and then, as indicated, to my attention. As the House will know, these matters are still before the Senate estimates committee. However, and this goes very directly to the point asked by the Leader of the Opposition, I have asked Senator Hill, when the Senate meets again - and he is the responsible minister, the Minister for Defence - to make a full statement to the Senate on this issue canvassing both the chronology and the substance of contact between ADF personnel, the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq and the ICRC and the extent and timing of communication of the details of such contact to officials of the government in Australia. - It remains the case that all statements that I have made on this issue have been based on advice from the Department of Defence; all statements have been based on that advice. Most importantly of all, it should be emphasised again that at no stage did Australia hold prisoners in Iraq. Let me say that again: at no stage did Australia hold prisoners in Iraq. There has been no suggestion of any Australian involvement in prisoner abuse, and any implication to that effect should be totally rejected. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Let me make it clear that Mr Hicks and Mr Habib are alleged to have undergone training with al-Qaeda, amongst other matters. Any Australian who receives such training now faces criminal penalties under the Commonwealth counter-terrorism laws enacted in 2002. The same argument applies in relation to the application of international law. The fact remains that prosecuting someone for an act that at the time constituted an offence under international law but was not an offence under Australia's law, regardless of how you present it and even if an enactment was to now make it unlawful, would be retrospective. The government has made clear its position that Australia's terrorism offences will not operate retrospectively. The opposition, on the other hand, is not quite as sure about its own position on these matters. In fact, over the weekend in separate interviews given by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Gellibrand it was quite clear that there were conflicting views. The Leader of the Opposition was quoted as saying, `We have argued consistently that justice should be dispensed -  - I am dealing with the context in relation to this matter, because there are arguments by some that justice should be dispensed in Australia because they are Australian citizens and by others that there are some limits to our law. This is the member for Gellibrand, who I think dealt with this issue quite admirably when she said:I don't think that it is impossible to apply international laws here but it would require a bit of unusual legislation being introduced to do it ... She goes on to say:I'm not sure there is an argument for us to do that yet.The opposition needs to state its position clearly in relation to this matter -  - The opposition needs to state its position clearly in relation to these matters because -  - I make the point again that the opposition needs to state clearly whether it supports retrospective criminal laws or whether that is, as the shadow minister suggested, a little too difficult. But the government are very clear in relation to this matter. Our view is that Mr Hicks and Mr Habib should be made to stand accountable for their actions before a proper authority, and in this case the US military commission is established for this purpose. Our view is that that should be occurring as expeditiously as possible, and it is why the Prime Minister has made very frequent representations to ensure that that has occurred.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question and acknowledge the work that she does on behalf of the electorate of Riverina. I inform her that today's balance of payments figures for the March quarter were released showing that the current account widened to $12 billion, or 6.1 per cent of GDP. This was driven by an increase in the trade deficit, which in turn was driven by strong growth in imports. Imports increased seven per cent in the March quarter and 16.6 per cent over the year. That is consistent with a strongly growing domestic economy.Export volumes for the quarter rose 2.2 per cent - that is, they increased but they did not increase by as much as the import figures - with rural goods rising a strong 13 per cent in the March quarter. That was primarily due to a strong rise in the export of cereal grains. Grain exports have more than doubled over the year, reflecting last year's wheat crop and some recovery from the drought - although we would be foolish if we were to think that the effects of the drought have fully worked through or that the drought has broken.What these figures suggest is that net exports will subtract 1.3 per cent from March quarter GDP growth. We have forecast, however, that as the domestic economy cools somewhat and the world economy picks up somewhat the position in relation to the balance of payments will improve - that is, Australia will not be bringing in the import rise that it has in the last year, and markets for our exports will increase over the course of the year.Net foreign debt in the March quarter was at 47.9 per cent of GDP. The Statistician has released a news release just in the last minutes indicating that the percentage figures in table 33 in the actual publication are wrong. He has revised that figure down to 47.9 per cent, which is lower than it was as a proportion of GDP in December 2002 and March 2003. So in proportionate terms net foreign debt has declined. Retail trade figures, which were released today, show that the value of retail trade was unchanged in the month but was 7.4 per cent higher over the course of the year. Combined with the easing of activity in the housing sector, this is consistent with slowing of domestic demand.This figure of 6.1 per cent of GDP on the current account is certainly not the worst current account that Australia has had, but we do not want to be complacent about it. The current account deficit is high. As I said earlier, we are forecasting over the course of the year, with demand slowing domestically and the world economy picking up, that those figures should improve. But anyone who imagines that all of Australia's economic challenges are behind us would be wrong. We have significant economic challenges. Add to that the world oil price and rising interest rates around the world and it is going to take quite considerable economic management in Australia over the next year or two. In particular, it is going to take considerable consistent economic management. Running the Australian economy is not like running a municipal council. It takes a considerable skill. One has to have sophistication in relation to economic management. The thought that a failure in running a local council could somehow qualify one for running a national economy is spectacularly false. It is a difficult business. It does require consistency. It is not the kind of thing that one can pick up from political advisers' books or the latest download in relation to Google. It is something that takes disciplined economic management. The people of Australia require that disciplined economic management because the future of their jobs and their businesses relies upon it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for yet another of his many excellent questions in this House. I can inform the member for La Trobe and other members that this government strongly believes that you cannot have good public hospitals unless you have good private hospitals as well, and you will not have a strong Medicare system unless you also have a strong private health insurance system to back it up. Thanks to the policies of the Howard government, private health insurance rates have gone from 30 per cent and falling to 43 per cent and stable. Thanks to the Howard government's policies there are now nine million people who enjoy the security and choice that private health insurance brings.These nine million people know where the Howard government stands. They are now entitled to know where the Australian Labor Party stands and whether the Australian Labor Party is going to rip the guts out of the private health insurance rebate and take away from them the $800 a year on average that they gain, thanks to the private health insurance rebate. Lest anyone think that these are all rich people, let the member for Lalor understand that there are one million Australians earning less than $20,000 a year who have private health insurance, and they need to know where the Australian Labor Party stands.I am quoting Mr Ahmad Mourad of Enmore, who says, `Please keep the 30 per cent rebate as, if it is removed, private health insurance will be out of reach.' I am sure he was speaking on behalf of the 37 per cent of people in Grayndler who have private health insurance. I am quoting Mr Allan Cations of Wyndham Vale, who says, `The 30 per cent rebate makes it possible for retirees to afford the best possible medical care when ageing bodies really need it.' He was one of the 30 per cent of people in the electorate of Lalor with private health insurance. I am quoting Mr John Davey of Canberra, who said, `Should the rebate be discontinued, we would not be able to afford to pay the extra 30 per cent as we are low-income earners.' He is one of the 53 per cent of people in Canberra with private health insurance. These people need to know where the Labor Party stand. You would think that, if the Labor Party really did support private health insurance, they would just say so. They would put these people out of their suspense and just say so. I am sure that the true view of the opposition was expressed by the member for Werriwa back in the days when he believed that expounding policy was as important as reading stories to schoolchildren. Let me read, if I may, to the member for Werriwa something from a book. It is from the Hansard of 1997. Talking about the private health insurance rebate, he said:This is the maddest piece of public policy that one will ever see out of the Commonwealth parliament. This is a first-rate absurdity.That is what the Leader of the Opposition thinks about the private health insurance rebate.Mr Speaker, if I could, let me say something through you to the Leader of the Opposition. There is more to being the alternative Prime Minister of this country than reading stories to schoolkids. It is also about producing policies that the adults of this country can read and understand for themselves. Mr Speaker, let me remind you of the sole contribution to the public policy debate that the alternative Prime Minister of this country made yesterday. His sole contribution was standing up and reading aloud something called Where is the Green Sheep? That is what the alternative Prime Minister of this country was doing yesterday. I could not work out whether this was a coded message to Senator Bob Brown or a subtle appeal to the environmentalists of New Zealand. It is high time that he grew up. It is high time that he got serious. It is high time that he told people where he stands on private health insurance because, if he does not make it clear, people will get a very clear message that, if there is ever a Labor government, you will pay more for your health.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson for her question and her interest in the conditions under which small business can thrive, both in her electorate and throughout Australia. Since this government came to office, we have seen record growth in labour productivity. We have seen a record number of jobs created - something like 1.3 million extra jobs in this country. We have seen sustainable increases in real wages for employees. We have seen record low interest rates and record low industrial disputes. This did not happen by accident; it happened because of the careful management of the Australian economy by this government and it also happened because of the development of flexible labour market conditions throughout Australia. Other measures taken by this government, such as reforming the capital gains tax system in this country and cutting personal tax thresholds, have led to more jobs and better conditions under which small business can thrive in this country.The honourable member for McPherson asked me whether there are threats or risks to these conditions. Indeed, there are. Just yesterday, it was reported in the Australian that the member for Fremantle, the President of the Australian Labor Party, is reported to have told a business group behind closed doors that there would be only modest changes to the workplace relations structure under a Labor government. Some of these so-called modest changes include regulating independent contractors, increasing union power by giving the union bosses a foot in the door of every workplace in Australia, forcing businesses to negotiate with union bosses whether employers or employees want to or not, removing the secondary boycott provisions from the Trade Practices Act, increasing the powers of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to intervene in the workplace, abolishing junior wage rates and increasing the regulation of workplace bargaining - so-called modest increases according to the member for Fremantle.In addition to this, it is the Labor Party's policy to abolish individual employment arrangements under Australian workplace agreements. Currently, some 16 per cent of federal agreements in Australia are individual Australian workplace agreements and, on average, people on Australian workplace agreements are earning some 23 per cent more than if they were covered by a certified agreement.On top of these so-called modest changes - indeed, a massive re-regulation of the work force in Australia - we learn some more about what the Labor Party policy is for business, and small business in particular, in an article in the Australian Financial Review today. The spokesman for the Labor Party said:... employees should not be dependent on the size of their employer's business, or whether they are casual or permanent, to be entitled to redundancy payments.What the Australian Labor Party are proposing, what a spokesman is reported in the Australian Financial Review today as saying, is that redundancy payments and redundancy conditions would be extended to casual employees in Australia. Not only have we got a situation that small business is facing now, where the Australian Labor Party are standing in the way of our proposals to change the redundancy system for small business, but what the Labor Party want to do is go further than that. They want to extend the redundancy provisions and the provisions in relation to redundancy payments to casual employees as well as permanent employees.No wonder the member for Brand, the former Leader of the Opposition, said famously once on radio in Perth that the Australian Labor Party are not the party of small business. Too right - they are not the party of small business. These are more proposals that are slipping out from Labor Party spokespeople on what is said behind closed doors about the massive re-regulation that the Australian Labor Party would engage in if they were ever elected to government. What it shows once again is that there is a yawning gulf between what the Labor Party are saying behind closed doors in some instances, talking about so-called modest changes to workplace relations, and the reality, which would be a massive re-regulation to the detriment of small businesses in this country and to the detriment of the creation of further jobs. </DOC>

 - I welcome the question from the member for Lilley, and the answer is no. Can I go on and say that up until yesterday I thought the complaint of the member for Lilley was that the additional, second $600 would be used to offset debts. Yesterday he changed his tack and he complained that it would not be used to offset debt. He can make one complaint or the other but he cannot make both, so we force him to his election. Can I say that, as the government has announced, every family that is eligible for family tax benefit will be receiving an additional $600 per annum. That is not just in respect of this financial year, ending 2004, but a payment before the end of this financial year, in the month of June. As a consequence of that, no matter how much he twists and turns, no matter how much he changes his ground, no matter how much he tries to get these questions going, the undeniable fact is that, under the coalition government, families eligible for family tax benefit A will receive an additional $600 per child per annum, and they will get that with a payment before 30 June and they will have an entitlement after 30 June.I also make the point, as we have on numbers of occasions, that under the Australian Labor Party, although you got far less in family allowance, those people who had received overpayments had to make good on those. The only difference in the current scheme from the way in which the Australian Labor Party administered it is that if you have an overpayment you have to make good on it, but if you have an underpayment you are entitled to a top-up. - No, it is a top-up. It actually turns out to be more money, which the Australian Labor Party never allowed them - not in 13 years. We actually think that is fair to the person concerned and fair to the taxpayer. The one thing I have not heard the member for Lilley say in all of this debate - and I would be interested if he did say it - is that if you receive an overpayment you should not have to make good on that. If the Australian Labor Party's view is that, by understating your income and receiving an overpayment, you would not have to make good on that then the taxpayers of Australia would have to make good on that, and I do not think that would be fair on the taxpayers of Australia. These are very generous benefits. The benefits to which people are entitled should be paid, and if, during the year, they have been underpaid, they should be entitled to a top-up. If, during the year, there has been an overpayment, then of course that can be set off against additional entitlements, including the $600. That is fair to the person concerned and it is fair to the taxpayers of Australia.The one undeniable fact in that fair system is that, under the coalition, they will be receiving more money than they ever did under the Australian Labor Party. That is point 1. Point 2 is that that increase is at risk, because the one assurance that we have not had from the Australian Labor Party is that, if they are elected, those payments will stay. The member for Fraser has made it entirely clear that the Australian Labor Party will not guarantee those payments beyond 2004-05, so the families of Australia ought to know this and they ought to understand it. Those increased family benefits are only guaranteed under the Liberal Party and the Nationals and are at threat and at risk from the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macarthur for his question, and I know his very strong commitment to the families in the electorate of Macarthur. I am aware of proposals that would increase the price of electricity for every Australian household and business, and those proposals are coming from the Leader of the Opposition. Large increases in electricity prices are the inevitable consequence of the Leader of the Opposition's policy to ratify the Kyoto protocol and establish a national emissions trading system.The Leader of the Opposition used to claim to understand the impact of increased electricity prices on business and jobs. I recall that when he was campaigning in the by-election for the seat of Cunningham he condemned this policy as extremist. It is just as well to remind ourselves of what the Leader of the Opposition said at that time. He said, `Well, it's Greens policy to reduce greenhouse gases by 60 per cent and, Tony, that has massive consequences for jobs.' He also said:If you implement their policy, you lose many, many thousands of jobs and you couldn't reduce greenhouse gases by that amount without literally closing down BHP in Wollongong and that would be an absolute disaster - for regional economy. Well, Bob Brown's policy is now the policy of the Australian Labor Party, and the Leader of the Opposition has reneged on his commitment to preserve jobs. In fact, what is now clear is that the Leader of the Opposition is prepared to trade jobs for preferences. This is shaping up as one of the grubbiest political deals that we have seen for many years. The Allen Consulting report, which was commissioned by the Leader of the Opposition's mates in Victoria, showed that emissions trading could cost up to 15,000 jobs and put up the price of electricity by about 27 per cent. At 15,000 jobs and a 27 per cent increase in electricity prices, this is going to have a devastating impact on Australian communities and families. Let me make the point very clearly: Australia does not need to go down this job-destroying path. It is a costly path; it is going to destroy jobs around the country. We are going to reach our internationally agreed target for greenhouse gas abatement without imposing unnecessary costs on households and businesses.But you have to wonder whether the Leader of the Opposition really understands what he is saying or whether he means what he is saying. Members may remember that he actually went to Gladstone in March to announce this job-destroying policy, this emissions trading policy, and he told the people in Gladstone that it would be good for jobs. It is a policy that would actually destroy jobs in Gladstone. It would devastate that town, as the member for Hinkler knows only too well. The Leader of the Opposition seems to believe that high costs are good for jobs. He seems to believe that higher costs make us more competitive. He seems to believe that it is good for Australian families to have their electricity bills put up by $200 to $300 a year. Anyone who believes these things would believe anything. As Alan Wood wrote in the Australian this morning:If Latham cares about ... jobs, he should reconsider his simple-minded support of ratification of Kyoto ...Mark Latham has not become more environmental, he has not become greener; he has just been browned by the leader of the Greens. Australian families and workers are going to pay the price in lost jobs and higher electricity prices for the preferences he thinks he is buying.</DOC>

 - Whilst members may now have forgotten the question asked by the honourable member for Corio, the answer to the first question is: yes, I am aware that today is National Apple and Pear Day. In fact, yesterday I issued a press release encouraging all Australians to eat an apple or a pear today because it was good not only for their health but also for our country. The second part of the honourable member's question, where he attempted to allude that Labor was supportive of a science based quarantine system, leaves me somewhat puzzled. That is the opposite of what the member for Corio said when he was speaking on radio 2AY just a couple of days ago. On radio 2AY he urged me to ignore the scientists in dealing with IRAs and suggested that I should take the advice of a committee of politicians on that matter.So is Labor in favour of a science based system or is it not? The member for Corio is backing science today and two days ago on radio he wanted politicians to make the decision. At the meeting of agriculture ministers in Adelaide just last month, ministers agreed unanimously - and this included the Labor state ministers - that decisions in relation to import risk assessments need to be based on science. They also, in a joint communique, emphasised the importance of respecting the professionalism of the scientists involved in the IRA process. They reaffirmed the importance of scientific independence in the biosecurity process.In relation to apples, Biosecurity Australia appointed a panel of leading experts to oversee an assessment of the scientific issues associated with the import of apples from New Zealand. They have issued an interim report, which is now open for public consultation. The public now have any opportunity they choose to raise scientific issues of concern until about 23 June, when that consultation period closes. After that, the scientific issues will again be assessed. This government are committed to import risk assessments based on science. We have an obligation under the World Trade Organisation to deal with issues in that way. We export two-thirds of all of the agricultural products that we produce. We want other countries to have a science based quarantine system and that is what we intend to deliver also for Australia.The other element of the hypocrisy of Labor in relation to this matter is when we look back to their days in office. Not only did they not have an open and transparent import risk assessment process but, once the arrangements were in place, they had so few quarantine officers that there was nobody at the border to inspect the product anyhow. Under this government, there has been major upgrading -  - a $600 million commitment - to ensure that we keep our borders safe and secure. - Our process will be based on sound science and if perchance at some stage in the future apples are allowed in from another part of the world, it will be under conditions that are safe and secure. I have every confidence that high-quality Australian Pink Lady apples will be able to compete with any product that comes into this country. I have more confidence in this industry than Labor obviously has.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I have not actually attended any of his community forums - I have attended plenty of my own - but I will take his word for it that people are concerned about petrol prices. I am too, but I am sure that, as a responsible leader on the Australian political landscape, he would have politely but firmly pointed out that there are a number of factors leading to increased petrol prices, not least of which is extraordinary economic growth in China, economic recovery globally and the onset of the driving season in the United States, as well as a whole range of other factors. I have no doubt that he would have sought to make some political points and to claim that his policy would have had an impact on petrol prices. In reality, the short answer to his invitation to join him is to say that, no, we will not, because it is more likely to reduce petrol discounting to the disadvantage of motorists. In terms of our own policy during the campaign and people's understandable concerns about petrol prices, I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that we will take the opportunity to remind people that during the 13 years the Labor Party were in government they became extraordinarily dependent upon the increasing taxation on fuel. The excise on petrol rose by 500 per cent in the 13 years they were in power. We have cancelled those twice-yearly indexation increases and we have reduced the burden of excise. The benefit of that elimination of excise increases is accumulating. It is increasing over time, as the Treasurer will point out. - It is already 5c a litre, but in real terms it increases. So, to any claim by the Labor Party that they have a latter day concern about petrol prices, I simply remind the voters that when they were in government they presided over a regime which saw the excise on petrol increase by 500 per cent. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Canning for his question. I can inform the House that the March quarter national accounts show the Australian economy continuing to grow in the March quarter but at a slower rate than in the December quarter, with quarterly growth being 0.2 per cent and through the year growth being 3.2 per cent. Particularly pleasing in these March quarter national accounts was the fact that farm production continued to grow strongly, increasing by 5.9 per cent, and is 41.6 per cent higher through the year. That is coming off an all-time record drought when farm production was smashed accordingly back in 2002, but it is particularly welcome to see production coming back to rural Australia, although it is far too early to say that the drought has broken. In substantial parts of Australia the drought continues to linger on in an aching way.Household consumption continued to grow strongly at 1.2 per cent, and that is supported by strong consumer confidence, record employment levels and unemployment which is now at 23-year lows. The March quarter national accounts show that dwelling investment decreased in the quarter. That is consistent with what we have seen in relation to housing approvals and housing finance, which indicates that the housing market is actually slowing. The good news on the inflation front is that Australia is confirmed as a low-inflation economy and wages growth remains moderate. Profits remain strong, with the profit share to GDP at around 25 per cent.But it would be a mistake to think that all of Australia's economic challenges are now behind it. We have made enormous progress in the last eight years with balancing the budget, reducing Labor's debt by $70 billion, locking in low inflation, reforming the taxation system and increasing labour productivity, but there are still great challenges to the economy. We have record high world oil prices. We have drought lingering on in some parts of Australia. It will take management in relation to the housing market coming off, and world interest rates are expected to rise throughout the course of next year. That highlights the need for consistent economic management. The idea that the economy has been so transformed that we can now afford to take risks in economic management is wrong.  - It is wrong. We cannot afford to take risks in relation to economic management. We have several challenges in front of us and it is important that strong economic management continue in our country so that people can have the best opportunities in what is a continuing difficult outlook for the world economy.</DOC>

 - We did not put downward pressure on petrol prices; we actually brought them down. That ought to be remembered - there is our record. I do not enjoy those high fuel prices, I should not think anyone in the House enjoys them and I know our constituents do not enjoy them either. Indeed, I remember paying petrol prices that in real terms were much higher during a previous conflict in the Middle East, when a different power was in this place. We accepted that, at that time, there was a short-term impact on fuel prices from a number of factors. From time to time, fuel prices do fluctuate. But, in relation to your claim regarding the oil companies, it is interesting to note that on Melbourne radio this morning Mr Jim Lamb from the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association was asked whether a guarantee was needed so that independents could get fuel from the major companies and whether this would make a difference. He said, `No, the oil companies have been very fair to the independents as far as access and supply, so I don't think that that particular point of Mark Latham's would have any effect.' I think that crosses that one off. It also ought to be remembered that the ALP are speaking with two voices on this. They really are. You have Mr Fitzgibbon, who occasionally has outbreaks of commonsense. He recognises, for example, that unfair dismissal is against the interests of employees. - I was going to make the point that the member for Hunter has from time to time displayed a little more integrity in these matters than the member for Rankin, who knows that the member for Hunter is quite right in relation to unfair dismissals but now wants to deny that he has ever been willing to say in front of employers that they are right - that the unfair dismissals do in fact cost jobs. - My point, Mr Speaker, is that the Labor Party have several positions in relation to petrol pricing. We ought not to forget that the federal president of the ALP, Carmen Lawrence, has been lending her name and support to a proposal to increase petrol to European levels - $2.50 or so a litre - because she thinks that would be good environmental and social policy. When you couple the position of the ALP's federal president on petrol pricing with their record when in government -  - My point is quite simply that with the Labor Party you have to look at what they do and never listen to what they say. The fact is that their federal president launched a plan for petrol at $2.50 a litre. The fact is that in government they massively increased the tax on fuel. We, by contrast, have reduced the taxation on fuel and reduced it substantially.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question. I appreciate the interest she shows. I have said this before: the member for Pearce is one of the members who not only has showed a great interest in the welfare of the Iraqi people and their human rights but has been there and has had the opportunity to meet with them. The Australian government welcomes the announcement of a new interim Iraqi government. The announcement was made overnight our time. This is an historic step in a strategy to bring freedom and democracy to the people of Iraq. The appointment of the interim Iraqi government is a result of extensive consultations between United Nations special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi and Iraqi community leaders.The interim government will be able to exercise its full powers as the sovereign government of Iraq from 30 June. The Coalition Provisional Authority will cease to exist from that time. The interim Iraqi government will be, if you like, a caretaker government until elections are held on 31 January 2005. As a sovereign government it will be able to conclude international agreements and conduct diplomatic relations. It will be responsible for economic reconstruction. It will be responsible for national policies and of course it will be responsible for those election preparations. It will also have quite clear authority over Iraq's security forces.The interim government comprises a balance of leaders who remained in Iraq under Saddam Hussein's rule, as well as some people who were in exile during that period of time. Let me take the opportunity to congratulate President al-Yawar, Prime Minister Allawi and the ministers who have been appointed. These are leaders with strong credentials. They represent the ethnic and religious diversity of Iraq. I know a lot of members will be interested to know that there are six women included in the government.The fact is that the formation of the Iraqi interim government reinforces Iraq's progress in a number of key areas. The transitional administrative law which was adopted recently enshrines for Iraqis their human rights and their civil, political and religious freedoms. There is now unprecedented access in Iraq to the media. There are 120 newspapers there. There is satellite news available to people. Over four million children have been vaccinated, 2,500 schools have been rebuilt, all the universities are open and hundreds of thousands of jobs have been created through reconstruction work. It is worth noting also that electricity and oil production are close to prewar levels, despite the activities of terrorists who are trying to disrupt the supply of both electricity and oil.Over 200,000 Iraqis now constitute the Iraqi security service. That is not just police; that is people who are being trained in the new Iraqi army, as well as others who are involved as private security contractors. So a significant number of Iraqis are already moving into the area of security. The terrorist bomb that went off, which members will have heard about overnight or yesterday, shows that terrorists will do what they can to try to derail this strategy. But let me reassure the House that the government will do everything it can to make sure that the Iraqi interim government is successful, that it is able to fulfil its responsibilities and that the some 24 million people in Iraq are able to achieve a new era of freedom and, ultimately, democracy. </DOC>

 - The answer is, no, we will not be adopting Labor's plan because we do not believe it would give balanced or better outcomes to consumers or, for that matter, farmers. The Dawson report is being considered, and I believe that we will find a fair and proper way to balance competing interests, as we have in the past. But, when it comes to farmers and the Labor Party, I have to say what they remember you for is interest rates that virtually killed them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Casey for his question. I remind the House that, as part of this year's budget, the government announced a policy by which there would be a government co-contribution of 150 per cent to what people put into their superannuation for those on an income of up to $58,000 per year. So for those earning up to $58,000 per year, if you were to put an additional $1 into your superannuation, the government would make a co-contribution of $1.50 and, as a consequence, there would be $2.50 for every $1 that was put into that scheme.If we take a person on average weekly earnings of $39,220, they are eligible under this scheme to put $626 per annum into their superannuation and would receive $939 per annum from the government as a co-contribution to their superannuation. That is a pretty good deal - $939 from the government by way of a co-contribution to their superannuation. Over the course of a 30-year working life, this would increase their accumulation balance by $36,000, or an 18 per cent improvement, as a consequence of this scheme. You would think that, for the low-income employees of Australia, both political parties would welcome such a scheme and would say, `What a wonderful scheme to help people save for their retirement.' You would think that the Labor Party, which professes to be interested in average weekly earners, would say, `What a wonderful scheme,' but I regret to inform the House that the Australian Labor Party opposes this scheme. It opposes a scheme to pay $1.50 for each person's contribution. Why would the Australian Labor Party do that? Apparently, the Australian Labor Party thinks that a much better policy would be to reduce the 15 per cent contributions tax and has put forward a proposal to reduce it by one per cent from 1 July 2004. Let us work out what that would mean for a person on average weekly earnings. It means that a person on average weekly earnings with a nine per cent super guarantee would get a one per cent reduction on their super contributions tax, which would give them, in the year commencing 1 July 2004, an additional $35.30 per annum - or, in a weekly tax cut, it is 7c per week. Mr Speaker, you have heard of the ABC contributing 7c a day. Instead of the opportunity to get a $939 co-contribution, Labor is offering average weekly earners, as an alternative, a tax cut of 7c per week. But there is good news, because on 1 July 2006, the contributions tax would come back by another 1c and the tax cut from the Labor Party would rise to 14c per week. It is a 100 per cent increase. By this stage, they would have been denied the opportunity of $939 per annum in 2004, 2005 and 2006.This is the importance of policy in politics today. We can run around with all of these schemes which are designed to try and endear people to the media, we can run around with all of the latest pop theories that the Leader of the Opposition wants to go on about, but what counts in Australian political life is policy. Policy counts. Policy is what determines people's outcomes. You can run around and promise all sorts of tax cuts to all sorts of people but, if you cannot name the rates, the thresholds, the amounts or how it is going to be paid for, it does not mean a thing - it does not count for a children's book. It is the same in relation to superannuation. You can run around and say, `We want to give middle- and low-income earners an opportunity,' but, until we know a policy, we do not know how to assess the emptiness of these promises. Labor has put forward a policy - an unfunded policy as it turns out - with regard to superannuation and you can compare and contrast a person on average weekly earnings of $39,220 under a government policy eligible for $939 per annum and, Labor's alternative, a tax cut of 7c per week. I think that makes pretty clear the political party that has thought about the position in relation to superannuation and savings of Australia's middle-income earners. That political party is the coalition. If you do not do the work, you cannot help the people of Australia who need help so very badly.</DOC>

 - I have no doubt that at the same community forum he showed the leadership necessary to point out that the very great bulk of those people he claims have no benefits have children and will do very well. Did he point that out? No doubt he also pointed out that we have provided for some very generous co-contribution arrangements for lower income earners who are contributing to their own super. But he also pointed out, no doubt in the same breath, that he was going to stop it, that he did not support it, that he wanted to take it away from them. The fact is that the budget, far from overlooking regional Australians, does them proud. It makes a very real difference because a large number of them are in a situation where they particularly need better opportunities for their children. I do not think it is any secret that a lot of country people have families, perhaps more than the national average. They even tend to have more children and they are in more necessitous circumstances, as you point out. Nothing could benefit them more than being in a situation where, overwhelmingly, they are $600 a child better off per family. Add to that a whole range of other measures designed to promote businesses in rural Australia.You said it was in Bundaberg. That is an interesting place for you to mention. What have we just done for the most important industry up there, the sugar industry? It is something that the member for Melbourne said we should not touch. We have looked after the sugar industry. We have secured a future for them. Did you mention that? Did you mention the reforms for the wine industry that are very widely welcomed? Did you mention, since you are keen to talk about environmental issues, the money for piping and capping, the bore scheme, right across Australia? It is a very good budget for regional Australia, and anyone suggesting that regional Australians do not get enormous benefit out of the tax changes is simply not being fair dinkum.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question and for the interest he shows. The House would be aware that the government have a comprehensive plan for delivering a better future for Iraq. We are determined, through our aid program and our diplomatic and troop commitments, to achieve this. We have the courage to stand for what we believe in and we have the courage to deliver our own programs. Just in case the House needs to be reminded of this, we will not cut and run from Iraq. The honourable member asks: are there any alternative approaches? There is, of course, the alternative approach of the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Labor Party. We have been doing our best to try to work out where this alternative approach comes from.I think the House should be aware that I have a theory. My theory is that the alternative approach comes not from the imagination, the commitment, the passion and the belief of the Leader of the Opposition but just from an American political consultant named Dick Morris. I had a bit of a look at this. Dick Morris produced a book in 1999 called The New Prince. I got this copy from the Parliamentary Library. It has been read; it is a bit dog-eared. Honestly, the Leader of the Opposition should look after other people's books when he borrows them. Having read The New Prince, the Leader of the Opposition wrote a review of the book in the Financial Review. It is very interesting to read this. It describes Dick Morris as a `political genius'. He wrote: Morris is the Machiavelli of our time ... His success as a political consultant in the United States is now matched by his dazzling insights and advice in printed form - in The New Prince, of course. The Leader of the Opposition went on to say:He makes the rest of us look like flim-flam on the atlas of public life - `us', including the Leader of the Opposition, the flim-flam man. Like a starry-eyed teenager -  -  - It is very closely linked. It was interesting that the Leader of the Opposition came up with his cut-and-run announcement on 2UE, on the Mike Carlton show, on 23 March 2004, which of course surprised his caucus colleagues so much. I must admit, I reflected on why he would suddenly have said this. The theory was that Mike Carlton just put him up to it and he just said what Mike Carlton said, but I found the truth. There is a newspaper in Washington called The Hill. The Hill is a newspaper for congressmen and congressional staff. Who has a column in The Hill? Dick Morris. Interestingly enough, on 4 March Dick Morris had an article in The Hill. This is only about two weeks before the Leader of the Opposition's cut-and-run remarks. The article was headed `How Bush can destroy Kerry fast'. What advice did he give President Bush? It is very interesting to read:... Bush must begin to pull American troops out of Iraq after the handover in June.That is what Dick said to do on 4 March. And on 23 March, there is the Leader of the Opposition who, having read TheHill, decides that that is what he will do. Morris even invoked Vietnam:President Johnson kept the troops in Vietnam and lost. President Nixon was withdrawing them, and he won.Mr Speaker, what this shows is a serious point. Of course it is amusing on one level, but there is a serious point here - that is, that the Leader of the Opposition is not a man of conviction; the Leader of the Opposition is not a man who believes in things; the Leader of the Opposition is exposed as nothing more than a fraud. The fact is, I note only too well Dick Morris writing in the Australian newspaper today. He said this of the Leader of the Opposition -  - Of course I will, Mr Speaker. What is more, let me conclude by drawing attention to what Dick said in the Australian today:He's running a great campaign. I just wish that I could take credit for it.Dick Morris, you can take credit for it all right!</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. It should not be forgotten that the new tax system introduced in July 2000 offered very substantial taxation cuts for lower income earners in particular. The member for Capricornia identifies farm workers on between $30,000 and $35,000 a year. Those tax cuts resulted in people in that position paying in the order of $1,250 less tax a year. That is point No. 1. In percentage terms, it is around a 17 per cent reduction in tax, going back to that time. As the Treasurer has repeatedly pointed out, there were certain other groups in the community who were denied their tax cuts at that time, and I will come to the sorts of people who are critical to electorates like yours who were denied the tax cuts - people who are needed by everyone in your sort of community -   - tradespeople, truck drivers, electricians, plumbers and so forth: the people who were bumping up against the tax scales that were so constructed as to act as a disincentive, because you would not give them the relief that we wanted to offer some time ago. - It was important that that be given for electorates like yours and, frankly, like mine. But the suggestion that somehow we forgot people in regional areas in this budget does not stack up, for the simple reason that you, too, like the previous questioner - that is, the honourable member, like the previous honourable member, Mr Speaker - `forgot' to talk about what was obviously the intent in this budget, and that was to target families.We believe in families. We want to try to give them more choice, more options, better flexibility when it comes to balancing work and family responsibilities, and all the things that the Leader of the Opposition - this bloke who hates America but loves all things American - says he believes in. We want to actually deliver on all those things. Giving families flexibility and choice and increasing family payments is the best way to target families - and boy, have we increased those payments. They are very substantial and they are of enormous benefit to the constituents of the member opposite who asked the question. As one who employs farm workers, I know first-hand how thankful they are for the changes in the taxation arrangements.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. Since its election in 1996, this government has focused unashamedly on the importance of literacy and numeracy, national standards and testing and reporting to parents against national standards for reading and numeracy. In fact, recently I announced that a $700 learning tuition coupon or voucher will be delivered to every parent of a child who did not pass the basic year 3 reading benchmark in 2003. I am pleased to say that today New South Wales has announced that it will be providing the results of those tests to all parents in the state of New South Wales.I am asked about other policies. The Leader of the Opposition has focused a lot on the importance of reading to children - which, of course, is supported on this side. Apart from love, we believe that the greatest gift we can give children is reading. On Monday, at the launch of the latest book by the highly acclaimed children's author, Mem Fox, the Leader of the Opposition said this:The truth, as a parent, is I couldn't have done it without Mem Fox.He went on to say - and it is very important that the House remembers these words: Mem impressed upon me the importance that you can't start early enough, that learning doesn't start the first day of school, it starts the first day of life, and we shouldn't wait until babies are three or four before we start reading books.It is interesting that, after the launch, one of the journalists asked the Leader of the Opposition a question. The question was: Mr Latham, that was a lovely story that you told us again today about Mem Fox's inspiration for Labor's policy but you are rewriting history a little bit, aren't you? You've brought this up before, you've written about this before you met Mem Fox. The response from the Leader of the Opposition is quite instructive. He said:... she sent me Reading Magic ...That is interesting: he could not even get the name of his favourite book right: Possum Magic - ... she sent me Reading Magic, her book. Prior to that, I had written my book on education, What did you learn today? And I've got to say it was an omission - I didn't have material and policy in there about the importance of reading books to our infant children.I thought: `That's interesting. Why would the Leader of the Opposition deny the fact that he had anything in his book about the importance of reading to children?' Then, thinking of the Treasurer, I thought, `You can airbrush a web site but you cannot airbrush a book.' So I went to the book What Did You Learn Today? which the Leader of the Opposition said he wrote before he met Mem Fox. I turned to page 87. There is an entire section entitled `Parents as educators'. I will spare the House the entire passage; but it says, for example:Absenteeism, excessive television viewing and inadequate reading in the home explain up to 90 per cent of variations in high school maths results. - So when I go to the book What Did You Learn Today? which the Leader of the Opposition said he wrote before he had met Mem Fox, he goes on under an entire section, `Parents as educators' and says:In their infant and teenage years, children spend only a small proportion of their time in school. By age three, children have acquired more than one-half of the language they will use for the remainder of their lives. Parenting practices in the early years have a huge impact on lifelong learning, sound practices such as regular reading ...And on it goes. There is a pattern emerging here where the Leader of the Opposition wants people to believe a particular point of view which he wishes to promote and a certain persona which he is seeking to adopt. I think we would all remember the unedifying sight that we had on 22 April this year when on the Channel 9 news we had Bill Clinton in the State of the Union Address saying, `Every 12-year-old child will be able to log onto the computer,' and then next to that we had the Leader of the Opposition saying, `Every 10-year-old will be able to log onto the computer.' Then the Leader of the Opposition was on the news trying to deny that black is white - denying that he was a copycat, that he had plagiarised that. In fact, on the ABC AM program on 22 April, he said in defending this -  -  - So to the ABC, he said:... the targets that I've set are ones that I believe in, that are right for this country, particularly the reading program for our children.The idea there came from Mem Fox, Adelaide-based children's author ... So these are Australian home-grown ideas. That would be the case whether they were from Mem Fox or whether they were in fact from the Leader of the Opposition. In fact, here is the answer. If you go to the State of the Union Address in 1997 you will find that President Bill Clinton said:You must read with your children every night.Learning begins in the first days of life. ... young children develop emotionally and intellectually from their very first days, and how important it is for parents to begin immediately talking, singing, even reading to their infants.Far from being a home-grown idea! And those comments were repeated on Monday at the launch of Mem Fox's most recent book. What did the Leader of the Opposition say on 22 April this year when he was asked about it by the ABC? He said:But I had a read of it - that is, Clinton's address - last night and I'm not familiar with the content of it other than the reading I had last night and I didn't know that there was reference there to reading programs and the suggestion that it's an idea I got from Bill Clinton, I got it from Mem Fox here in Adelaide. I've made that plain on the public record consistently.When you go back to the section in the book on `parents as educators', you see that there is a reference - reference No. 59 - and the source of this is not the Australian Literary Guild, not the Australian Labor Party and not Mem Fox; the source is the United States Department of Education Strong Families, Strong Schools Washington, DC, 1994. So what we have discovered is that these are not home-grown ideas at all and there are two things that are emerging. The first is, as Laurie Oakes said in the Bulletin on 18 April: `The Leader of the Opposition is a serial plagiariser. He doesn't just take two or three lines. Its larceny on a grand scale.' - The second issue, which is in fact more important, is that the Leader of the Opposition, having spent 8½ years in the parliament attacking, vilifying and criticising everyone and everything that got in his way and having described himself as a `hater', is now trying to write a fairytale that Mem Fox inspired him to read to children. The challenge the Labor Party failed when the Leader of the Opposition was the member for Hotham was that it was trying to get the Australian people to understand the real character of its leader. Now it is terrified that they will.</DOC>

 - I thought at the present time that if you used an ATM which was not your bank's you could get a higher fee. That certainly has been my experience. When I used the Westpac ATM in Parliament House I noticed that, not being a Westpac customer, I did get a higher fee -  - so I do not know what the member is referring to. - He can prove me wrong, but I believe that you can pay a higher fee if you go to an ATM which is not your own bank's. That is already the situation. From memory, and I might be wrong about this - I do not want to mislead the House - the increased fee -  - was around $5, but I cannot quite remember. I will go back and have a look at my bank account. In relation to fees that are set as between providers, if there is an agreement between providers to set fees which are anticompetitive, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has the power to investigate, and we would expect it to do so. - In relation to interchanges which are the result of the banking system, the Reserve Bank of Australia has control over the payments system and it can lay down rules - which we would expect it to do - to encourage competition and the best deal for consumers. That is, in fact, what happened with credit cards. We believe both of these regulators are sufficiently resourced to look very carefully at that matter. We will expect them to ensure a pro-competitive outcome. We would expect them to ensure an outcome which works in the favour of consumers. If they want to refer these matters to us, we will certainly give them those instructions and, indeed, re-emphasise to them that we want a competitive, pro-consumer outcome.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note that he is very concerned about this. He often raises the shortage of skilled labour along the Murray River to meet the needs of the horticultural and other industries. In this place we often hear, with all of the fervour of the recent convert, about community forums. It is a bit like fatherhood and reading - now we have community forums as though they are a recent invention. Having been involved in them now for 15 years or so, I recently had six days on the road and conducted a lot of community forums. I engaged in a lot of face-to-face time with people. Over those six days, I went to Coffs Harbour, Wagga, Gunnedah, Tamworth, Armidale, Eidsvold, Warwick, Mungindi, Warialda, Goondiwindi and Coonamble.The interesting thing is that there was one issue that came up at every single one of those forums. It was the issue of finding enough skilled tradespeople. It came up everywhere. It was about getting truck drivers, electricians, carpenters, joiners, plumbers, motor mechanics, chefs, cooks and diesel mechanics. As I looked through the media recently, I noted that the Courier Mail in Queensland ran an article headed `Teens want to be masters, not apprentices'. It talks about the 500 apprentice positions available now along the Gold Coast to Sunshine Coast stretch of Queensland. Interestingly, in another related story, we hear of three young Australians - Brock Campbell, Lee Richardson and Phillip Lumsden, who are 21, 17 and 16 years of age respectively - who have moved to try to capture those opportunities. What is amazing is that they are looking for remuneration between $45,000 and $70,000 as qualified tradesmen when they finish their apprenticeships. So the remuneration is really very attractive indeed - reflecting, in part, the shortage.Of course, that is very important in all of those rural electorates. It is important to the member from Rockhampton, who asked an earlier question. We need more of these people and they need incentives to work. But, before that, they need incentives to train. We have had a bit of chiacking from the other side. They say we are not doing anything to provide incentives. Yes, we are. The abysmal picture that we picked up when we came to government really has been turned around. We now have well over 400,000 new apprentices compared to about 135,000 in 1995. Can you believe it? Of those, and this reflects a significant rise as well in the proportion, around 34 per cent are in the trades and related occupations.We are taking significant extra steps to meet their needs. I am indebted to my colleague the Minister for Education, Science and Training in this area. For example, today the situation is that each employer of a new apprentice in the bush at the certificate III or IV level receives $4,400 in commencement and completion incentives. They are also able to get a special incentive of $1,100 for new apprenticeships in skills shortages in rural and regional areas.A more recent initiative was in April when the minister announced a new national skills shortage strategy to specifically tackle this problem in areas where there are shortages because of a new industry coming in or an old one declining or departing. That will test fresh approaches: shorter apprenticeships, specialised apprenticeship pathways in industries such as building and construction and closer coordination between schools and local business employers. We talk so much about community forums in this place, but what struck me was that employers and trainers everywhere on that trip said that we as a country are sending an unhelpful message, and we need to address that - all of us. That message to our kids is that somehow to really make it these days you have to be in pursuit of a university degree - to be valued you have to pursue a career that involves a degree. The fact is that 70 per cent of our young people do not go directly to university. We need to avoid this message that we are tending to send that, if you cannot get into university, there is nowhere for you. Many of these newspaper articles talk about trainers and employers being concerned that if we cannot encourage young people to make it to a university degree we tend to encourage them not to try and to drop out when, in reality, we need to be highlighting the real jobs in what might be called the heartland - in these skilled occupations that are well paid. There are real opportunities and really good remuneration available.What, in the face of this, does the ALP do in this place? We hear question after question on university places, but we almost never hear about the shortage of skilled people out there and the opportunities that are going begging for them. More than that, if the Labor Party were to have any credibility on this issue at all they would not only acknowledge it, talk about it and seek to address it but would start to condemn their state colleagues for the 300 per cent to 400 per cent increase in the cost of TAFE education in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calare for the question. At the outset, the government believes the report that he is talking about is disappointing. The report recommended a model that will ensure that children are included in people-smuggling operations. The government will not be encouraging such activity. This report is backward-looking and unbalanced. It fails to appreciate the extreme pressures and complexities of managing sizeable numbers of people arriving without authority, clearance and notice. The inquiry into this matter had dragged on at considerable taxpayers' expense.While the inquiry dragged on my department made a significant number of practical improvements to the arrangements for children in immigration detention, many of which were under development well before the inquiry was even announced. It is very important to take a reality check on all of this. As at 19 May 2004 there were only 12 unauthorised boat arrival children in mainland detention centres - only 12! - All of them have been offered alternatives and all of them could be out of detention centres if their parents had chosen to let them out. The majority of unauthorised boat arrival children are now in accommodation, in alternate detention arrangements which were never in place under the previous government, under whom, 10 years ago, 342 children were in fact in detention. There were 318 children and 24 were born after arrival - a total of 342. Virtually all the children currently in detention for more than a few weeks attend school in the community around those places of detention. All children have access to health care 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with access to specialists where required. These and other measures, such as ongoing consultations with state based child protection authorities and a program of activities and excursions, are designed to properly care for the physical and mental health of children who find themselves, through their parents' actions, in detention.The government believes that if children or their parents have any concerns about their conditions or treatment they can - and they do - raise them through a variety of internal and external complaints mechanisms. - We are very satisfied that we take our responsibilities for these children very seriously. As I said before, all of these children could be out if their parents chose to have it so.</DOC>

 - This is a serious matter. The government does see the issue of terrorism and the potential harm it could wreak in Australia as a matter of very real significance. We are committed to pursuing those who threaten our citizens and our interests both here and abroad.Yesterday, in the District Court in Western Australia, a judge sentenced a Mr Jack Roche to nine years jail, with a non-parole period of 4½ years following a guilty plea last week on charges relating to plotting to blow up the Israeli embassy. The Australian Federal Police, ASIO and the Director of Public Prosecutions collectively have dedicated a great deal of time and effort to this case, as observed by the judge. I would like to also add my thanks to all those officers involved. In this matter, the prosecution sought a sentence approaching the maximum penalty of 25 years for this offence. In sentencing, the judge alluded to the seriousness of the charges while acknowledging the cooperation more lately offered by Mr Roche. It is worth emphasising for the benefit of the House that, despite contacting ASIO, it is known that Mr Roche continued plotting the bomb attacks beyond that point. Also, contrary to recent claims by his defence counsel that were repeated in some media reports, the court was told that information provided by Roche to authorities did not play a role in the arrest of the suspected Bali mastermind, Hambali, or the al-Qaeda operator, Muklas. This has been confirmed to me by our agencies.The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions is independent. It is a statutory office. I know that following my inquiries he is giving consideration to the merits of an appeal in relation to the severity of the sentence in this matter. I have asked for that report and, in exercising my responsibilities, I will be guided by his advice on that matter.This case has reinforced our knowledge that Australia is not immune from the effects of international terrorism. We have known that since October 2002, when 80 Australians tragically died in the Sari Club in Bali. Evidence has emerged in this case that serves as a chilling reminder that extremists do exist and operate within Australia. We are a terrorist target because of who we are and what we stand for. The national security measures that we have adopted have been important in dealing with this. There have been further developments today. The Australian Federal Police have charged a 34-year-old Sydney man, following an investigation by the Australian Federal Police's joint counterterrorism team. The counterterrorism officers arrested the man outside his Lakemba home this morning and formally charged him with one count of collecting or making documents likely to facilitate terrorist acts. The Sydney man is the first to be charged with this offence since the introduction of our counterterrorism legislation in 2002. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. The arrest here follows a lengthy investigation involving collaborative efforts by ASIO, New South Wales Police and the Australian Federal Police. The matter will be before the court shortly, and I will not be commenting in detail on it. The man is to appear later this afternoon in the Central Local Court.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question. I know how much of an advocate he is for small business. The Liberal and National Party coalition is constantly concerned about small business. Not only have so many people on this side of the House worked in small business, but also we are constantly in tune with their needs and desires. That is why, after the Industrial Relations Commission in March of this year extended redundancy entitlements to small business, the coalition government said, `Enough is enough.'For 20 years, the previous program of exempting small business from the eight weeks redundancy program worked well. With union support, the Industrial Relations Commission overturned that, with a cost to small business of nearly $6,000 for a tradesman and $3,500 for a shop assistant employed for more than four years. We reacted by saying that we will introduce legislation to this place to preserve the entitlement of small business to be exempted from this unfair burden being placed on it by the Industrial Relations Commission. Yesterday I saw a press release from the member for Rankin. I was intrigued to find out that the Labor Party were going to oppose us in relation to protecting small businesses. This is way they will do it:Labor will help small businesses who cannot afford to pay new award redundancy pay entitlements.Then they go on to say that they are going to force small business to pay those entitlements but they do have, very interestingly, a safety net for small business. They say:In those cases where the small business is, in fact, insolvent, the redundancy obligations would be met through the Government's GEERS arrangements.GEERS is the General Employee Entitlements Redundancy Scheme. I am intrigued that they say they are going to meet those redundancy obligations through the government's GEERS, because there is one little problem: the Labor Party have a policy to abolish GEERS. The Labor Party want to abolish GEERS and now they are announcing to 1.1 million small businesses that it is going to be used as their safety net.I know that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has worked really hard to convince the member for Rankin that GEERS is a good scheme. He has worked really hard at that, and he must have convinced him, because I thought the member for Rankin was on the record about GEERS. I found a press release from 11 August last year by the member for Rankin. In that press release, he said this about the safety net that he is embracing to protect small business: `GEERS is fundamentally flawed. It was a hastily cobbled together sham. It has not protected employees' full entitlements. It makes no provision for unpaid superannuation.' Yet, as of yesterday, it is Labor Party policy. If the Labor Party is abolishing their opposition to GEERS, the Treasurer would be interested to know. This creates a further hole in the Labor Party's costings. What a surprise. Here, in the Labor Party's savings policy of 31 March 2004, it says, `Abolition of GEERS, $303 million.' - That is an oops. In the pool: $303 million. I will give that to the Treasurer and pull it out later. - We are intrigued, because the member for Rankin has a history of saying one thing behind closed doors and another thing in front of the doors. Now he is confused in public. Now that the Labor Party is embracing GEERS, now that the Labor Party says that they are going to use it to protect small business, they have to find $303 million. We await the Labor Party's new revenue raising proposal.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The allied landing at Normandy was the largest military operation ever undertaken. It involved some 350,000 allied troops. Amongst those personnel there were close to 3,000 Australians - serving in both Australian and British units - who took part in the D-Day operations and the battle for Normandy. There were about 2,500 Australian airmen who flew over Normandy on operations. The Royal Australian Navy contributed around 200 personnel to D-Day. The sailors had all been seconded to the Royal Navy, and Australian merchant seamen served on troop transports and in supply ships. On land, up to 25,000 Australian soldiers served in Normandy on exchange with the British Army, as did a number of war correspondents and a few Australians in the French Resistance. Fourteen Australian servicemen - 12 from the Royal Australian Air Force and two from the Royal Australian Navy - are recorded on the Australian War Memorial Roll of Honour as having died on D-Day.The Prime Minister will participate in four commemorative events. He will be joined by Mrs Howard when he and others attend a ceremony at Bayeux, the site of the largest Commonwealth war cemetery in Normandy. At the invitation of President Chirac, the Prime Minister and Mrs Howard will then participate in the 60th anniversary celebrations at Arromanche le Bain, the central landing beach stormed by allied forces. They will join a very significant group of world leaders and dignitaries, including the Queen, President Bush, Prime Minister Blair and Chancellor Schroeder. Four Australian veterans of the D-Day landing will be present. One, Mr Dacre Smyth, will receive the Legion of Honour from President Chirac as a representative of all of the veterans. Nine other Australian veterans will also receive the Legion of Honour in separate ceremonies, including in Australia. It is worth noting that also present will be the New England Singers, a choir from the Armidale area in regional New South Wales. In the evening, the Prime Minister will deliver an address at the Typhoon memorial. The Typhoon memorial commemorates men who flew Typhoon fighter-bombers - in particular those who were killed - over Normandy. Eight Australians are listed amongst those who died in that operation. Lastly, the Prime Minister and Mrs Howard will attend a reception at the town hall of Noyers-Bocage. Australia's participation in D-Day may, on casual examination, seem small compared with the contribution of the other allied nations, but the service of Australians at Normandy showed that Australia, though facing a threat close to home, remained committed to the cause of liberating Europe.The government thanks the French government for bestowing the Legion of Honour on the Australian veterans. I know that all members of the House would want to pay their respects to those veterans and join with us in expressing that appreciation. We acknowledge, too, our ongoing debt to all of our veterans. The Australians who died in Normandy were the second generation of Australians to go to France and lay down their lives for democracy, freedom and the things that we not only believe in but must guard against taking too lightly. We remember them and all who served. We ask that, on Sunday, all Australians reflect on the significant events that took place on the beaches of Normandy 60 years ago.</DOC>

 - Because of the way the Labor Party has been handling it - and, to be frank, some elements of the media - it is a massive beat-up. What the Labor Party is suggesting here and what the Leader of the Opposition is suggesting is that some Australians in some way were involved in the Abu Ghraib scandal. -  - So they were not involved - that is the thesis now, is it? What are you going on about, then? -  - I think I have made my point. I say there is some suggestion from the opposition that Australians in some way were involved in the Abu Ghraib scandal as revealed in the photographs and you all interject and say, `That's not right,' in which case it is a beat-up.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I can inform him that the Australian Bureau of Statistics today released their house price index for the March quarter. It shows that house prices in capital cities grew on average by 2.5 per cent in the March quarter, which is significant, but that is slower than has been the case back to the March quarter of 2001 - that is, there is a deceleration in the growth of house prices. In Sydney there was a deceleration by two percentage points to 3.5 per cent growth, and there was slowing in Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Canberra and Darwin. Melbourne actually recorded a fall in house prices. I have been warning for some time that you could not expect the kind of growth that you have seen in the housing market to continue indefinitely and making the point that, from the government's point of view, we would prefer to see a plateauing in prices, rather than overheating in the market. We actually welcome the fact that that is starting to appear. The decline in house price growth is also confirmed by other indexes such as Residex, building approvals and auction clearance rates.I am asked if there could be any other policies that might affect the housing market. I regret to say that, in the member for Cook's home state, you have seen an incompetent state government blunder into the property market with the most ill-advised policy imaginable at a time when the housing market is decelerating, and imposing a new tax on investment housing in that state. Just to recap, New South Wales will receive $9,648 million of GST revenue in the forthcoming year. New South Wales will receive a bonus, over and above the old system, of $113.7 million. The New South Wales Carr Labor government has recently decided to impose a new 2 per cent tax on investment property in that state. So you are taxed when you buy the property, you are taxed when you sell the property in addition and, of course, you are taxed when you hold the property as well.Needless to say, there was no mention by the Labor Party that they would be introducing this tax before their most recent election. That, of course, is the modus operandi for Labor - try and get into office and increase taxes afterwards, as we saw with federal Labor in 1993. -  - I am pleased that the members of the Labor Party opposite are interjecting in support of Premier Carr and his policies. But I was rather amazed to see a story in the Daily Telegraph today which illustrates the absurdity of these new Labor taxes. The Daily Telegraph reports on two building sites or developments that are being built on either side of Griffith Street, which forms the border between New South Wales and Queensland. On one side you have Coolangatta, I guess, and on the other side you have Tweed Heads. On one side you have the wonderful member for McPherson, and on the other side you have the wonderful member for Richmond. Of these two towers, the tower that is being built on the Queensland side of the border is selling but the tower which is being built on the Tweed Heads side is not, because on one side of Griffith Street you pay no vendor exit tax and on the other side of Griffith Street you pay 2 per cent. It is now being put forward that, in order to deal with the situation, the Tweed shire will have to be declared a zone and excised from the New South Wales tax laws as a consequence of this. We can imagine the same thing happening between Wodonga and Albury and the same thing happening between Queanbeyan and Canberra. The thing that does amuse me in all of this is not just the incompetence of the New South Wales Carr Labor government. Have we heard a word from federal Labor on the new New South Wales property tax? The member for Werriwa, former staffer to Premier Carr - and of whom Premier Carr still speaks fondly all these years later - apparently has nothing to say about the New South Wales new property tax. On this side of the parliament, we do. It is a bad tax. It is incompetently administered, it was not promised, it was a breach of faith, it was introduced at possibly the worst possible time in a decelerating house price market and it will make things much worse in New South Wales than they need to be.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Herbert. He is a great champion of the personnel of the Australian Defence Force, being the representative of many of them here in this parliament. He can go back to Townsville and tell those personnel in Townsville that, on this side of the House, we are proud of them; on this side of the House, we do not think that they have breached the Geneva conventions; and, on this side of the House, we think that they have done a heroic job in Iraq. That is what we think.The government obviously condemned, as is well known, the abuses that had been taking place in the Abu Ghraib prison as demonstrated by the photographs that were released publicly. We supported the investigations, and we certainly have had conversations with our coalition counterparts about the action they are taking to deal with these abuses. I have spoken with the Secretary of State of the United States and the British Foreign Secretary and, obviously, they share our concerns and their governments are taking decisive action. By the way, I look forward this evening to meeting with the President of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Jakob Kellenberger, when we catch up over dinner in Brisbane.The Australian Defence Force legal advisers who were, and are, in Iraq have been promoting human rights in the coalition. They promoted an understanding of the obligations of the coalition in coalition military command to the Geneva conventions, and they have coordinated meetings between the coalition and the Red Cross. They even helped to arrange Red Cross prisons visits. But neither the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade nor the Department of Defence, and personnel in those departments, had known of the extent of the Abu Ghraib abuses as demonstrated in the photographs released on 28 April and thereafter.The suggestion by the Labor Party is that somehow those ADF personnel knew about those abuses and they did not tell people or they told people a little bit but they did not tell them much or the departments knew about those abuses and did not pass that information up to their ministers. That is a smear against the reputation of good soldiers in the ADF. That is a smear on the reputation of many good and hard-working public servants, and by those people it is very much resented. But it is typical of the Labor Party under the Leader of the Opposition. It is political opportunism.After 16 January, when the issue of abuses was made public, the Labor Party never bothered to ask a question about it, never sought a briefing and showed no interest in the issue. The member for Griffith did a doorstop today, as he does every day, and was asked this question - this is, I think, very important - at the doorstop: do you suspect that Australian military officers may have seen the abuses firsthand? That was the question he was asked. From what the Labor Party has been saying, you would think that the answer to that was yes, wouldn't you? `No,' he said, `I am just saying that, in terms of this whole debate, there is no evidence to that effect at all.' The member for Griffith and the Labor Party say that no Australian Defence Force personnel saw these abuses, that they did not know about these abuses, but they - the defence department, DFAT, the Prime Minister, the foreign minister, the defence minister - are all culpable. That is a scandalous proposition. `You don't suspect it at all?' said the journalist. The member for Griffith: `We don't have evidence to that effect.' Then what are you talking about? What is the argument of the opposition, if that is the case?   - I am sure that interjection is disorderly, by the way. When the member for Griffith was asked on 3AW yesterday, on 2 June, whether he had established if the Prime Minister knew anything about these abuses, he said: `Ah, no. That's not our point.' So the Labor Party's point is that the Prime Minister did not know anything about it and could not know anything about it and nor could the foreign minister and the defence minister. The Labor Party's point is -  - My point is this: the Labor Party says that the Prime Minister did not know anything about these egregious abuses. The Labor Party knows that the defence minister and the foreign affairs minister did not know anything about it. The Labor Party is saying that Australian Defence Force personnel did not know anything about these egregious abuses and that DFAT personnel did not know anything about them, but somehow this is a great scandal. If I may say so, this just exposes the weak opportunism of the Labor Party on this issue - smearing the reputation of public servants and smearing the reputation of the Australian Defence Force personnel. -  - We are politicians. We are used to you smearing our reputations - you have made a lifetime of that. The opportunism on this issue is exposed in a doorstop interview that the Leader of the Opposition did on 31 May. - The honourable member interjects `Sergeant Schultz'. - That suggests that we knew something but we are not passing it on; in other words, that Australian Defence Force personnel told us about the scandal in Abu Ghraib and we did nothing about it. In that respect, you are smearing the reputation of our Defence Force. That shows what a weak, vacuous sort of an opposition you are. -  - I want to finish with an example of the sort of opportunism that we have seen from the opposition. - This is very interesting.An opposition member - What about the truth? - Will you stop abusing the Australian Defence Force! -  - My point is this: the Labor Party suggests that there is a cover-up here, which suggests that somebody had knowledge before 28 April about the egregious abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison. Who could have that knowledge?An opposition member - You. - I could? How would I get that knowledge? I have not been to the Abu Ghraib prison. According to the argument of the opposition, it would come from people in the Defence Force or from people in DFAT. But they have all said they did not know about it. So what is the Labor Party suggesting about officers in the Australian Defence Force and officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade? Are they suggesting that when saying they did not know about these egregious abuses those people have not been telling the truth? That is my point. In a doorstop on 31 May the Leader of the Opposition was asked:Are you pleased that Australian government officials will be able to speak to Major Mori - who is David Hicks's lawyer - about the torture claims?The Leader of the Opposition's reply was:I'm not aware of that new information but I hope that all the claims and suggestions about the torture atrocities coming out of Iraq ... is made available.Major Mori is nothing to do with Iraq. Why is the Leader of the Opposition talking about Iraq in that context? Because he was programmed to abuse the government over Iraq - even though he was asked a question about David Hicks's lawyer he got into abuse about Iraq. That just about sums up the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - That is the same argument, because the suggestion here is that somebody in the Australian Defence Force or in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade knew about the egregious abuses in Abu Ghraib. Is the Labor Party now arguing that they did or they didn't? I mean, I would be interested to know what the Labor Party's argument is, and one day we will find out. I hope it will be subject to a good deal of scrutiny, by the way - a good deal of scrutiny. - I made the point on the -  -  - Do you want to hear the answer or do you just want to chat away amongst yourselves as though it were a caucus meeting? Let me just explain the point I was making on AM this morning so everybody in the House will understand it. Australia, Britain and the United States had an MOU. Under this MOU all of us agreed to abide by the Geneva conventions, and we have abided by our obligations under the Geneva conventions. If Iraqis were captured during the war - and, of course, they were - then the detaining power would have responsibility for those people. If, on the other hand, those Iraqis were captured by, say, Britain, which is the example I used here - I cannot remember which way around I put it on the AM interview - and they were then handed over to the Americans -  - All right, the other way around - I will stick with the way around I have done it this time. If they were captured by Britain and handed over to the Americans then in those circumstances the British would retain some obligation, some duty of care for those people, even though they would be detained by the Americans. I made that point. - And the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - awake, apparently - says, `That's the point.' That is the point. But there is another point that might interest you: the facts. We should bring the facts on just for five minutes in the third quarter. The facts are that in no situation was Australia ever the detaining power. In every situation - and there were five - where Australians were involved where Iraqis were captured, they were detained by the Americans. So we completely fulfilled our obligations. The suggestion, and this is the suggestion -  - It is perfectly clear that Australians were not involved in the detention of Iraqis, so we fulfilled all of our obligations. There may have been Australians present, but the detaining power in every single case was the United States of America. That is the legal point and, I would have thought, a very obvious point.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question and for his interest in family policy in Australia, because we find that many, many Australians are very interested in what the government can do to help them with the weekly bills and the future of their children and their families. That is why in this budget the government have made a feature of helping Australian families - the 2.2 million Australian families who receive the family tax benefit.If you take an average family - dad on $40,000 per annum, mum perhaps doing some part-time work for $10,000, with two kids - that family will be receiving $600 per annum per child as a result of this budget. For two children, that is $1,200. Because we changed the income test for family tax benefit, on $40,000 they will be receiving an extra $965 per annum in family tax benefit because they will get some part of the maximum. Because we changed the income test on part B of the family tax benefit, when mum goes back to work she will not lose as much of that benefit as would have been the case previously. She will get an additional $1,252. So, all up, that family would be eligible to receive an additional $3,417 per annum as a result of this budget.There is one other measure that I think people ought to focus on in this budget, which is superannuation. Let me continue with that family, with dad on $40,000 and mum on $10,000. Dad, on $40,000, is eligible to put $600 into superannuation and would then get a co-contribution from the government of $900 - 150 per cent of $600. Mum, on $10,000 a year, is eligible to put $1,000 into super and would receive as a co-contribution from the government $1,500 into superannuation. That family could qualify for a government contribution to their superannuation of $900 and $1,500 - that is $2,400 - if they are able to access their full entitlement. - What is the alternative Labor policy? And I thank the member for Kingston for interjecting right at this point. Labor voted against the co-contribution - the member for Kingston nods vigorously. Labor voted against the co-contribution: $2,400 per annum! But Labor does have an alternative. Under the Labor Party policy, dad on $40,000 - get a load of this! - could get a tax cut of $36 per annum. And mum - get a load of this! - on $10,000, under Labor could get a tax cut of $9 a year. Dad's tax cut is 69c a week and mum's is 17c per week. That family under Labor could get a tax cut of 86c a week. Who would want $2,400 per annum when you can have 86c a week? That is the Australian Labor Party's answer on superannuation. That family - dad on $40,000 and mum on $10,000 - could get $3,417 per annum extra in family benefits and $2,400 in superannuation. And, for that family, Labor's alternative is 86c a week. I think it is pretty clear that when you sit down, do the sums and work on policy, it is the coalition that is interested in Australia's families. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I have to admit that I will have to take the time to check the figures that the member for Kennedy has put forward. But, can I say, I certainly do not agree with the second part of his question in terms of an appalling market distortion. The retail grocery market of course is overseen by the ACCC and, in terms of the operation of the market, it faces constant scrutiny. Can I just say, as an aside, that Australia does enjoy, from the intense competition within the retail grocery market I am advised, some of the lowest prices for groceries in the OECD.In regard to the final part of the question from the member for Kennedy, the government is currently considering that report. It is at the moment with the Office of Small Business, as they do the final consultations in regard to the Buck report. We will respond to it shortly both in terms of that report and the Trade Practices Act. I understand the Treasurer is considering a response in regard to the Dawson review. In terms of giving farmers a better go at negotiating a higher price for their produce, the government has already indicated our support for collective bargaining amongst those producers who are selling to larger companies.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dickson for his question. Yesterday, I did inform the House of the arrest of a 30-year-old Sydney man following the investigation by the Australian Federal Police and their joint counter-terrorism team of matters involving Bilal Khazal. Subsequently, he was bailed in Sydney in the Sydney Central Local Court on a charge of collecting or making documents likely to facilitate terrorist acts contrary to section 101.5 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. In relation to this matter, I have spoken to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I have also been appraised of an approach by the Commissioner of Police in New South Wales in relation to this matter, and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions is considering options in relation to the grant of bail in this case.It is important for members to be aware that in Commonwealth matters bail has been dealt with by state and territory courts pursuant to their respective state and territory legislation dealing with bail. That happens in relation to a number of the matters, including sentencing. It is obvious that it is best not to have a system in one state where you have different regimes for state-committed offences and Commonwealth-committed offences. Each state does deal with the issue of bail somewhat differently. In New South Wales there has been a long-standing and general presumption that exists that a person is entitled to bail. That presumption does not apply to charges in certain serious offences, including murder, manslaughter, narcotics, certain firearms and certain violence offences. Terrorism has not been defined in this way for the purposes of bail in New South Wales nor, might I say, at this stage, in any other state of Australia. The police minister in New South Wales raised this matter with me on Monday following another matter, and indicated that New South Wales would be looking to amend the bail law in New South Wales. I am pleased to inform the House that a bill was introduced today and passed the New South Wales legislative assembly to amend bail laws to ensure that the presumption is against bail in matters involving serious terrorism offences.I obviously welcome that and would encourage other states and territories to review their laws. But I do not know whether their parliaments are sitting. I do not know how long it would take. For that reason, I have received policy approval to move expeditiously to amend the Commonwealth Crimes Act to include a presumption against bail, while maintaining the capacity for courts to grant bail in only exceptional circumstances. I would hope to bring that bill forward and receive speedy passage for it through both houses when we resume. I think it is important to have a national approach in all jurisdictions relating to this matter. I think it needs to be clear that terrorism offences are going to be treated with the utmost seriousness. The Commonwealth does continue to enjoy a very close working relationship with the states and territories in relation to these matters. I think that was evident in the matter that I informed the House of yesterday. I understand that there has been some criticism directed at the timing of this matter and the arrest. That is a reflection upon two independent statutory officers - the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions. They are both independent in relation to these matters. The timing of the investigation and the consideration as to whether there was sufficient evidence to prosecute were matters addressed by each of those officers exercising their independent role. Timing was a matter that was totally within their hands. </DOC>

 - Many members may not be aware that there are certain codes of behaviour in relation to the conduct of legal proceedings which the Commonwealth observes, and that is to be a model litigant.  -  - I am disappointed that honourable members would see some mirth in that. The fact is that as a model litigant the Commonwealth has an obligation to put all relevant matters that might be considered in sentencing before the court. I am surprised that anybody would see any mirth in that.  - I mentioned a number of matters yesterday. I simply make the point in relation to this matter, as I have before, that sentencing is dealt with by the courts. It is a matter on which the court makes a determination. If the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions forms a view that there has been an error in relation to the sentencing in accordance with proper principles, he can consider an appeal in relation to that matter. The Director of Public Prosecutions is giving consideration to that. This is quite unrelated, because the issue of Mr Roche has to be dealt with under the law as it now is, but let me say that it has been suggested - and I acknowledge that there is a very wide degree of interest in this matter - that the government should consider options for amending terrorist legislation to set nonparole periods for terrorism offences. I might say that I would not consider such amendments to be out of order. We have used this type of mechanism before, particularly in the context of smuggling offences. While the measure, if it were to be pursued, would be considered as an extraordinary circumstance, I think terrorism offences demand consideration of those matters. I will be looking at it with a view to bringing forward further amending legislation to set a nonparole period in relation to terrorist offences.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. The member for Hinkler has told me that Kyoto is of seminal concern to his constituents, particularly in the City of Gladstone. I quote the member for Hinkler in answer to his own question:In fact no city in Australia would be affected more than Gladstone if Kyoto were signed in its present form.The member for Hinkler is a great champion of his electorate. The Kyoto protocol sets greenhouse gas emission targets for developed countries. I think it is important that the House, in contemplating this issue, understands that current projections indicate that most Kyoto parties will not meet their emission targets. The European Union 15 - that is, the 15 members who signed up to this before the enlargement of the EU on 1 May - had a target to reduce emissions by eight per cent. Currently the projections are that their emissions will only be reduced by 0.5 per cent. So the European Union is way overshooting. Greece's target was actually to be able to increase its emissions by 25 per cent, but current projections show that Greece is going to increase its emissions by 36 per cent. Belgium is well over. Japan is well over. Canada is well over. France, for example, is projected to be 9½ per cent above what they anticipated - not just what they anticipated but what they signed up to. New Zealand is already 21.3 per cent above its target. I am making the point that it is one thing for countries to say they are going to sign and ratify the Kyoto protocol but it is noteworthy that not all, but a very large number, of those countries are not meeting those targets. It is also noteworthy that in 2002 the national greenhouse gas inventory in Australia showed that our emissions were only 1.3 per cent above 1990 levels and we, unlike those countries which have ratified Kyoto, are on track to meet our target of eight per cent above our 1990 levels. Are there alternative views? The member for Wills, speaking for the Leader of the Opposition, who was unfortunately unwell at the time, said in a speech on 27 May, `By ratifying Kyoto and joining the emissions trading system' - and joining the emissions trading system is the important phrase there - `Australia can catch up with the rest of the developed world.' That is clearly a nonsense. I have just explained that the rest of the developed world is out of kilter with what they have signed up to. How are we going to catch up with the rest of the developed world? We are going to join the emissions trading system. But the emissions trading system will be what costs the constituents of the member for Hinkler their jobs. His constituents will lose jobs as a result of that emissions trading system. Let us have a look, for example, at what the Allen Consulting study found for the Victorian government. - The honourable member interjecting is the spokesman on the environment. He used to be a member of the Victorian parliament, so his own government, if you could call it that, has found through a study that the emissions trading system supported by him would cost 15,000 jobs, lower wages and lift power prices by 5½ per cent. So we have crocodile tears about petrol prices, but we have the introduction of emissions trading and ratification of Kyoto which will of course increase energy prices.The Leader of the Opposition used to know this argument only too well. During the Cunningham by-election - and I am glad to see the member for Cunningham here - the member for Cunningham will remember the Leader of the Opposition running down to his electorate and running a scare campaign saying that the Greens, in favour of Kyoto and in favour of all the things they are in favour of, would cost jobs in Cunningham. He ran a scare campaign in Cunningham against Kyoto. Here is the headline: `Labor headkicker's attack on Greens sparks a backlash'. Of course, sitting opposite me here is the Labor head kicker.What has changed him since then? Why was the Leader of the Opposition so brown during the Cunningham by-election but now suddenly so green? Could the answer lie in Dick Morris? Dick went on Radio National and criticised George W. Bush for not signing the Kyoto protocol. I had a look at the end of that seminal book The New Prince. I have this book here - it is well read indeed. Not only has the Leader of the Opposition read it several times but I have read it myself. In the last chapter, `Issues for the first years of the 21st century', it says there are three issues that politics and politicians need to address - and I am not saying that I particularly disagree with them, by the way. One of them is global warming and the environment. And so the Leader of the Opposition is on to global warming and the environment - not during the Cunningham by-election but now. Just to let the House know, the second and third issues are genetic engineering and Third World poverty. Watch this space: soon you will hear speeches on those two issues. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Maranoa. He would be very well aware of the importance of the Great Artesian Basin, which lies underneath about a quarter of our continent. It contains a huge volume of water - about 65 billion megalitres. That is 130,000 Sydney Harbours. That volume of water would be sufficient to water the city of Sydney for 100,000 years. So it is a very important natural resource for our country and, indeed, one of the wonders of the world. But over recent times - over the last 100 years in fact - the level of water in the Great Artesian Basin has fallen by as much as 120 metres. Around a third of all of the bores that used to flow free have now stopped. In many areas the artesian water has simply flowed down into creeks or has just been lost in open bores and creeks. In fact, the volume of freshwater lost from the Great Artesian Basin is equivalent to the needs of a city the size of Adelaide.So this is a major environmental issue. It is one that should have been addressed a long time ago. It is one that Labor have ignored. I notice that they still scoff about it during this answer. They feign interest in the Murray-Darling Basin, but here we have the loss of millions of megalitres of water, gigalitres of water, every year, and Labor in government did absolutely nothing about it. Since we have come to office we have worked in cooperation with the Great Artesian Basin states to cap these bores. During the last five years over 300 bores have been capped, 5,000 kilometres of bore drains have been removed, 10,000 kilometres of polypipe have been installed and 71,000 megalitres of water has been saved. This is indeed a major environmental achievement. But we are not going to stop there. This budget includes another $42.7 million over five years to get on with the task. There are another 850 bores still to be capped, and around 18,000 kilometres of bore drains are yet to be removed. It is already clear that this scheme is working. Pressures are returning in a number of areas. Moree, Cunnamulla and Julia Creek have all reported improved pressures from the Great Artesian Basin bores. This is a major environmental rescue program. It is an example of what can be done when you have a government that really cares about the environment. It gets on with the job of doing the important things and achieving real things and preserving this important natural resource for many future generations. It is the lifeblood of many of the towns in the electorate of the honourable member for Maranoa and much of inland Australia. If the neglect of the Labor years had continued, the resource would have been lost for all time. We are getting on with the job of repairing and restoring the Great Artesian Basin. We do not just talk about it; we get on and do it.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Farrer, and I thank the House for its enthusiasm. Most importantly, I note the enthusiasm of the member for Farrer in helping young children in her electorate. I know that just recently she announced three grants to the community sector there. She does a fantastic job, like all members of the coalition.Today I announce that there is more good news for Australian child care. There is more good news delivered by the coalition government with our child-care support program. Today this government announced another $25 million to be added to that $200 million package, which is particularly important in increasing professional support to help children who have disabilities and children who live in rural and remote areas. This builds on the $1.5 billion that we have committed to child care in this year alone. Under the child-care support program $60 million will go to the inclusion of children with special needs - we are increasing funding there in particular - and $26 million will go to quality assurance. There is also funding going towards assisting professional development, in recognition of the great work of many of the workers in children's services. There is $138 million to go towards rural and remote communities and outer metropolitan regions to ensure that child care is viable and to establish new centres if there is unmet demand. I would like to thank all those industry representatives who were on the review task force over the last two years. They did a fantastic job and they should feel very proud that child care is becoming robust, more secure and more available to all. Again, this builds on the fantastic announcements made in the budget: 40,000 more outside school hours care places, 4,000 more family day care places and an enormous amount going into playgroups. I am concerned, as I know the member for Farrer is, about what the alternative policy positions are - if any - that are coming from the ALP. What really concerns me and, I am sure, many thousands of families is the policy position coming from the industrial arm of the Australian Labor Party - that is, the ACTU. The Federal President of the ACTU has stated that the private sector, who look after 255,000 children, are despicable and abhorrent. -  - I agree. It is incredulous, isn't it? But that is what she said: that the private sector are despicable and abhorrent, and that the corporate providers are evil. That is coming from the chief spokesperson for the ACTU. It also makes you wonder how that would impact on the 255,000 children if the Labor Party were ever elected to government with their philosophical view and the divisive wedge politics that they are trying to put through now - and certainly the ACTU is - when it comes to the provision of child care.The other interesting question is - and I know the Treasurer will be interested in this - what their costings are. What are their policies? We know that there was a leaked conversation when it came to the costing proposal by the ALP - or in particular the ACTU - where they promised an additional $3 billion to provide free child care and also to take over preschools. How on earth is this ever going to be funded? There are no costings at the moment. If there is one clear policy difference between the coalition and the Australian Labor Party it is that we believe in choice and in a robust, sustainable child-care sector. That is why we are funding it. We certainly do not believe in playing wedge politics or in having philosophical views that are starting to come into place now when it comes to the provision of child care, whether you are in the private sector, the community sector or in any other form of child care.</DOC>

 - The member for Lilley is back at it again. It is interesting to me that, when you look at when we came into government in 1996 compared to today, there has been a 70 per cent increase in funding to child care. There is now $1.7 billion going towards the funding of child care. Indeed, out of this budget came an enormous expansion of 40,000 extra outside school hours care places, 4,000 extra family day care places and up to 4,000 places in playgroups, recognising that many families choose not to use Commonwealth funded child care. Only 30 per cent do while 70 per cent choose to stay at home. But, of course, all we hear is criticism from the Australian Labor Party.That initiative alone in the budget was a further $250 million. Indeed, the announcement that I made today about the child-care support program will cost a further $25 million. If there is anything contrasting the coalition with the Australian Labor Party, it is that we have a firm commitment to child care. I think you should be directing your own questions to the head of the ACTU where you effectively want to close down the funding of 255,000 child-care places. - Indeed, Mr Rooster, you have failed well and truly.</DOC>

 - I acknowledge the interest that the member for Dobell shows in the care of older residents in his electorate of Dobell. I visited his electorate prior to the budget and met with providers and residents and discussed their issues with them, and I will be visiting his electorate again tomorrow to open a new aged care home that is being operated by St Vincent de Paul. So I thank him for his question.In the last budget, this government allocated the single largest ever investment in aged care by any government - some $2.2 billion - to ensure that older Australians who need care receive high-quality care in quality surroundings. Since 1997, we have been committed to ensuring that, through certification, the standard of homes is of the highest quality that we are able to achieve. In this budget we have been able to allocate further funding to capital needs in order to meet future capital needs for the upgrading, refurbishment, extension and building of new homes. First, we have increased the concessional funding. It will be some $438.6 million over the next four years. We have targeted rural and regional homes to ensure that their capital needs are met. We have also ensured that fire and safety and 2008 certification standards will be met by an injection of some $513.3 million before 30 June to homes throughout Australia. That includes some $325 million that will be allocated to the church and charitable community sector as well as $42 million to state government owned and run homes in Australia.I was asked about alternative policies. The fact is that, after eight years in opposition, this so-called alternative government has not come up with one idea in relation to aged care. Members may find that hard to believe. - Not one, Acting Prime Minister. I thought that perhaps there was something on the Australian Labor Party web site. So this morning I went to the Australian Labor Party web site - Labor's policy papers and discussion papers. It says that immediately after the last election former Labor leader Simon Crean announced a comprehensive review of all Labor policies with the exception of the sale of Telstra. I guess, if you do not have a policy, you save time in having to review it, because not one word about aged care, about the accommodation needs of older Australians, is contained in Labor's policy papers and discussion papers.I think that the industry recognises the fact that Labor has failed once again in aged care. Aged and Community Services Tasmania, a peak industry association, in a press release with the headline `Labor ignores aged', said: Federal Labor has forgotten Australia's frail elderly in its Budget reply, according to the peak body for Tasmanian aged care providers. Aged and Community Services Victoria said: Labor's forgotten people, Australia's frail aged.And the national report from Aged and Community Services Australia said: It's high time the opposition started laying its aged care cards on the table. When the Leader of the Opposition had the opportunity to respond to the government's $2.2 billion package in aged care, what did he say in his reply to the budget speech? Not a word about aged care. Shame, Labor!</DOC>

Under members opposite, vaccination rates dropped to 50 per cent; thanks to this government, they are now over 90 per cent. Under members opposite, just $13 million was spent on vaccines in 1996; under this government, $143 million is spent on vaccines. We have a very good record on vaccination compared to the appalling record of members opposite. Decisions and announcements that the government will make in the next few days and weeks will maintain thoroughly the government's outstanding record.</DOC>

 - I really do thank the member for Forde for reminding the House about the Centenary House rent rort because there is no single issue which more clearly exposes the fact that the Leader of the Opposition is a fake. The Centenary House deal is probably the biggest con job in Australia's political history. In the three weeks since this matter was previously raised the House the fleece meter has ratcheted up $6,721 every single day. In just three weeks the Leader of the Opposition has trousered more than $100,000 for the Labor Party's re-election. It is interesting that the return address for the false pneumococcal letters which are now going out to young women right around Australia was none other than the PO box for Centenary House. The Leader of the Opposition waxes sanctimonious about politicians' entitlements, but he believes in the Labor Party's political entitlement to a $36 million free gift from the taxpayer - the fraud. That is what he believes in. Thanks to the rent rort, taxpayers are paying more for a humdrum office in Barton than they would for top quality office space in New York. I did a little tour of the Internet the other day. Take the Trump building on Wall Street. With its limestone exterior and bronze and marble lobby, the Trump building is dubbed the crown jewel of Wall Street. I can tell you that on the 61st floor of this crown jewel of Wall Street the rent is $847 a square metre, which is significantly less than what the taxpayer is forking out for Centenary House.Trump Tower, with its bronze, glass and polished brass structure and cascading waterfall foyer, has such a striking appearance and such a reputation for decadence that with 2.5 million visitors a year it is New York's third most visited tourist attraction. That is where they are all going. The rent there, $953 a square metre, is just a little bit more than the current Centenary House rent, but it is what the rent will be when the ratchet clause kicks in in September. Thanks to the rent rort, the Leader of the Opposition is the biggest property shark since Donald Trump. But even Donald Trump has a modicum of decency. - Yes, he does - he believes in something. His latest book, How to Get Rich, includes the following rules among his steps for success:Be reasonable and flexible.Make sure both sides come out winning.He really is a kindred spirit to the Leader of the Opposition because he says:BS will only get you so far.So he obviously knows all about `BS Crean'. The Leader of the Opposition has come a long way from Green Valley to Trump Tower, but he lacks the ticker to end the lease fleece. If the Leader of the Opposition is not prepared to end the red rort and pay the money back, the Australian people will conclude he is an even bigger spiv than Donald Trump. - Mr Speaker, if it offends you, I withdraw.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley. One way is to have the opportunity of implementing the comprehensive policy that I outlined in the National Press Club earlier this afternoon, because the government's white paper Securing Australia's energy future will deliver environmental sustainability, prosperity and security to the energy sector for the benefit of all Australians. The white paper sets out a range of new initiatives to deliver reliable, affordable energy in an environmentally friendly way.Firstly, there is a program to provide $1.5 billion in investment in demonstrating new lower cost, low-emission technologies through the provision of $500 million to a technology fund. Secondly, there is a major reform of the fuel excise system, which delivers $1.5 billion in excise relief to businesses and households, to be delivered in a fiscally responsible way and enshrining the principle that all business use of fuel off-road will be excise free. Over $200 million in direct support to the renewables industry, including $134 million, will be provided to support commercialisation of renewable technologies. Seventy-five million dollars will be provided for solar cities trials, demonstrating a new energy scenario where solar energy efficiency and market reforms work together to deliver clean, reliable energy at affordable prices. We will continue to deliver renewable energy through the mandatory renewable energy target. Business will be required to do its part in ensuring Australian energy is used wisely. Under the white paper, businesses that are largely energy users, accounting for about 60 per cent of energy use, will be required to undertake regular energy efficiency assessments and report publicly on the outcome. In yet another area, the detailed, comprehensive policy blueprint that I have laid out on behalf of the government contrasts starkly with the absence of a properly constructed, coherent policy from the opposition. The only thing the opposition has to say about this is that, notwithstanding the damage it would do to Australia's national interest in its present form, we should sign the Kyoto protocol. This is a position that I doubt the Leader of the Opposition himself held at the time of the Cunningham by-election in 2002, when he said that the policy of the Greens, who then of course were not quite as favourably disposed towards him, would result in the destruction of thousands of Australian jobs. May I say that he was right back in 2002 and he is completely wrong now.</DOC>

 - The short answer to the question is no. The slightly longer answer to the question is that I gave the example of Australia and Indonesia competing for an energy investment in, say, natural gas, where Indonesia has large reserves, as does Australia. The carbon concentration in the Indonesian reserves is very high. Under the existing Kyoto arrangements, Indonesia would not be subject to any of the constraints that Australia would be subject to. The investment would inevitably - because it could take place in more propitious circumstances - flow from Australia to Indonesia,. We would lose Australian jobs and Australian investment, and the world's climate would be no better off because the gas would still be used - it would be dirtier. And all the Leader of the Opposition would have achieved by that would be, in fact, to destroy Australian jobs. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his two-part question. I inform him that today's reforms to the fuel excise system give Australia a sensible, streamlined, well-balanced fuel excise system which can take Australia into the next century. Before this government introduced the new tax system, the excise paid by heavy transport in this country on petrol and diesel was 43c a litre. We have reduced that to 19c a litre and, as a result of the announcement today, that same benefit is going to be extended to trucks over 4.5 tonnes, regardless of where they go in Australia.In addition to that, this government will be introducing a system under which there will be full off-road diesel fuel rebates, not just for farming and mining but for all off-road use, so that local councils in remote areas will be able to get it in relation to road construction, so that we will not have to go through these arguments as to what does and what does not constitute mining - all of those will be getting it. That policy stands in stark contrast to that of a certain political party which, if it gets elected, actually wants to increase the diesel excise rates on the mining industry. So here you have one side of Australian politics helping, in relation to the job creation part of the Australian community, and another side standing for higher taxes, as it always did.In addition to that, the announcement that has been made today in relation to fuel excise will mean that all private and business use of fuel for electricity generation will be effectively excise-free. So, for those living in rural and remote Australia, the people who are using fuels for their electricity generation will be getting that effectively free. In addition to that, those who are currently paying excise on burner fuels such as heating oil and kerosene will also be getting the advantages of the announcement which we have made today.In many respects, this completes the proposal which the government put to the electorate and wanted to introduce back in 2000. We were defeated at that time by obstructionism from the Australian Labor Party. To the Australian Labor Party we say today: `Get out of the way. Let the government get on with these reforms. These reforms are good for Australia.'</DOC>

 - The energy white paper is the most comprehensive document that any government has produced on Australia's energy future in the last 30 or 40 years. It stands in stark contrast to the policy emptiness of those who sit opposite. I am not aware of that particular remark -  -  - Not by that particular person, no. A lot of people make a lot of remarks. I am aware of the fact that the price of fuel in Australia has for a long time been determined by the world price. It is a policy that I understand is adhered to by both sides of Australian politics.I also know that a number of factors are bearing upon the price of petrol in Australia at the present time. Despite the discomfort of high prices at the bowser, the very energy white paper to which you referred discloses that Australia has the fourth cheapest petrol prices in the world. Unlike the Labor Party the white paper, and the policy underpinning it, proposes further reductions in taxes on fuel. Bear in mind, Mr Speaker, that the person who asked me the question belongs to a party that is wanting to rip I think $500 million out of the value of the diesel fuel rebate to the Australian community, and he has the nerve to get up and ask me questions about energy security.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As the Treasurer has noted, we have taken fuel excise for the export and manufacturing sector from 43c down to 19c, and we are now extending those benefits in a way that will constitute major and ongoing benefits to very significant new sectors of the Australian economy. What ought to be noted is that, when we came to power, amongst all OECD countries we were amongst the highest taxing on transport fuel; we are now amongst the very lowest. Given that one in five Australian jobs - and one in four jobs in the regions - depends on exports, it makes a lot of sense to do everything we can to reduce the taxation burden on transport fuel in Australia.These arrangements will mean that the fuel tax system for both on-road and off-road users will be more transparent, rational and equitable, and it will better secure existing jobs and create more jobs - that is the shorthand. Providing a full excise rebate on all fuel used off road for businesses will be a boon for a number of industries, including quarrying and construction, and for local government. We believe in local government, particularly when it comes to maximising the Roads to Recovery program. This will dovetail very well: they will be able to drive the Roads to Recovery program faster and further because of these reforms.The replacement of excise credits with a road user charge for heavy vehicles meets a major concern that the transport industry has had with the present system. The road user charge will also apply to around 54,000 petrol powered heavy vehicles that do not qualify for tax credits under the present system. We will remove those very administratively difficult urban and regional boundaries that apply to the existing fuel tax credits, and that will take away a major cause of frustration, and I would argue cost, for many road transport operators. We will bring in a single business credit system for fuel excise, and that will again simplify and streamline arrangements for a lot of Australian businesses. As the Treasurer has also alluded to, the benefits to around 90,000 households across the country, from the lower transport costs and direct measures like abolishing the excise on fuel used for power generation, will be very widely welcomed indeed. These savings are estimated to be worth around $1½ billion between now and 2012. That is a very significant amount. When combined with the excise arrangements for alternative fuels announced earlier this year and the new AusLink land transport plan, you have a clear demonstration that, just as we have greater needs for transport infrastructure and so forth now because of a strongly growing economy, because the economy is well run we are in a position to further meet those needs as the economy goes forward.This stands in very stark contrast to the Labor Party. You should never listen to what they say on matters like this; you should always look at what they do. No-one should ever forget that in government they presided over a 500 per cent increase in fuel excise in this country. It went from around 7c a litre to around the mid-30c a litre, which took our transport fuel taxation regime from amongst the lowest to amongst the highest of OECD countries. We have taken it back to a situation where we now genuinely enjoy tremendous world competitiveness. Indeed, I would venture to say that, in real terms, transport costs have never been lower for that very important export sector of the Australian economy.I doubt that there is an exporter in the country who would want to put that at risk by flirting for a moment with the ALP. I do not know whether the member for Hunter, who asked a question a moment ago, has gone out and told his coal exporters and all the exporters in the Hunter Valley that he is going to add a new tax to their industries and that he is going to cost his constituents jobs. Just in passing, I wonder whether he has been out there and also told them, as I am reminded by Mr Baldwin, the member behind me, that he opposes funding for a lot of the road projects that have just been announced in the Hunter Valley.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. Today's statement provides a very sharp contrast between the government's comprehensive and integrated approach towards energy and the environment on the one hand, which positions Australia for lower emissions and a cleaner air future while maintaining our competitive advantage, and, on the other, Labor's hugely costly job-destroying policies that will undermine our international competitiveness, cost jobs and not achieve the environmental outcomes that they are talking about.The first thing to get quite clear is that, as a result of the government's policies, we will be achieving Australia's internationally negotiated target for greenhouse gas emissions by 2010. Today's energy statement positions Australia to look beyond Kyoto, to look to the longer term to a world that is going to be further carbon constrained. It has a very strong focus on reducing emissions, both through cleaner coal and renewable technologies - it is not a matter of choosing one or the other. We plan to take advantage of Australia's unique energy resources: the sun and the wind as well as coal and gas; and our abundant renewables as well as fossil fuels.This plan focuses on win-win strategies and on greater energy efficiency in Australia's energy-intensive large companies as well as households and the design of our cities. Energy efficiency alone has got the capacity to cut business costs by up to 30 per cent and provide a $9.4 billion cumulative gain to the economy by 2020. The plan contains key initiatives to overcome technical and market barriers for wind and solar power and to encourage commercialisation of a whole range of renewable energies so that we have got real choices when we come into this more carbon constrained world.This is a smart strategy. It is a strategy which contrasts with the stupid strategy which is being put forward by the Labor Party, because the Labor Party's policies would pump up business costs, cut the growth in the Australian economy and lead to industries moving offshore. Labor's proposal to lift the MRET to five per cent would cost the economy some $11 billion - a cost that we do not have to pay. The Peter Garrett-Bob Brown plan to have a 10 per cent MRET would cost the Australian economy $23 billion that we do not have to pay. We are going to reach our target. We need to position ourselves in a clever way for the longer term. We need win-win strategies that will actually increase economic growth and improve the environment, and all the Leader of the Opposition can put forward are policies which are going to pump up electricity prices, destroy jobs and drive Australian industries offshore. He said once that jobs would come first. The clear choice now before the Australian people is a smart energy strategy and a smart strategy to cope with greenhouse gases or a stupid strategy to destroy jobs, industries and Australian communities.</DOC>

 - The short answer is: no, no, no. This is further illustration of the fact that the Labor Party is not thinking these policies through in a smart and intelligent way. The energy and environment statement that the Prime Minister released today contains tremendous encouragement to renewable energies. This is the best boost that renewable energies in this country have had for years, since the government established the mandatory renewable energy target. What we have done is to put in place policies that will target the problems that renewable energies have in achieving the commercial take-up.There is $34 million in this statement being committed to overcoming the storage problems of wind energy and to forecasting impediments to the take-up of wind power by the grid. There is $75 million in this statement for regional experimentation with solar power. The Solar Cities initiative is going to be the most imaginative and exciting effort to provide opportunities for distributed energy that this country has seen. The Solar Cities initiative is going to address the real market impediments that solar power faces, including the absence of satisfactory metering for the provision of solar power at peak energy demand times and therefore the lack of rewards and incentives that consumers face.The government has thought through these issues. The Labor Party wants to increase the costs on Australian industry in a completely undifferentiated way simply to bring through existing technologies, provide Australia with no more choice and impose negative costs on the economy of $11 billion. That is a massive subsidy which fails to address the problems which this policy addresses. It will destroy jobs. It will undermine the international competitiveness of Australian industries. It will put up electricity prices for every family in Australia. It will damage all those communities like Gladstone in Queensland, communities dependent on energy-intensive industries. This is the smart way to address these issues; the Labor Party's is the stupid way.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. We all know what a staunch advocate he is for the energy sector in his electorate, particularly the LNG sector, which has not only achieved great success but has even more potential, particularly into the US, following the Prime Minister's visit. The Securing Australia's energy future paper that was announced today by the Prime Minister represents a new era in the long-term energy policy for Australia. Measures contained in the energy paper will most importantly keep Australian business costs down and create jobs. It will increase even further our natural advantage in the coal and gas sector. I am sure the member for Hunter is supportive of that.  - I am surprised if he is not. It will expand and diversify our energy supply and also encourage reliable and affordable low emissions technology.Last week we saw yet another - I think, for the ninth month in a row - unemploy-ment figure below six per cent. That is a tangible demonstration of the enduring strength of Australia's economy under this coalition government. Our strong economy and its associated strong jobs growth have been underpinned by competitively priced and reliable energy. It is important that the white paper also includes energy market reform. - The member for Hunter had better keep looking because it is coming like a train for him. The energy market reform will also assist to attract $37 billion worth of investment into the Australian energy sector. In terms of the white paper, it also includes forward-looking initiatives to further develop cleaner, smarter and more affordable technologies. These incentives will allow Australia to maintain its competitive energy advantage and will include, of course, the $500 million low emissions technology fund, which will in turn attract a further $1 billion or more from the private sector in investment. There will be $75 million available for the Solar Cities trials, and $100 million will be available to support commercial development for smaller scale renewable energy technologies. All this adds up to a policy which is good for jobs, good for industry, good for consumers and good for the environment. I am asked about an alternative policy. Of course there is an alternative policy. It is the old way, the Labor way: ratify Kyoto - costs jobs; increase the MRET - costs jobs; and introduce the costly emission trading regime - which of course will cost jobs in the Hunter region. Labor's policy is ill-conceived and simplistic. It will discourage investment and it will cost jobs not only in the member for Hunter's seat but in the member for Hinkler's seat and in the member for McMillan's seat.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question and recognise that he has many small businesses in his electorate that will benefit from the energy white paper. In particular, the reforms will provide about $1.5 billion of excise relief for regional businesses, particularly small businesses. From 1 July 2012 all off-road business use of fuel - all fuel - will be effectively excise-free. So tourism operators in the member for Herbert's electorate -  - and there are a lot of them, servicing the Great Barrier Reef -  - In Leichhardt, there are many of those businesses. They will all enjoy cheaper fuel because of this initiative from the Liberal and National parties. Small fishing boats, for example, servicing the fish markets in Sydney or Melbourne will effectively enjoy cheaper fuel. The use of all fuel for electricity generation will be effectively excise-free from 1 July 2006. For example, in the member for Barker's electorate, on parts of Kangaroo Island they will now have cheaper fuel as a result of this initiative from the Liberal and National parties. Heavy vehicles that weigh more than 4½ tonnes will also have cheaper fuel. So landscaping businesses operating in the middle of cities or perhaps furniture removalists travelling up and down the Hume Highway or the Pacific Highway - all of these businesses will get cheaper fuel as a result of this initiative announced by the Prime Minister today.When it comes to red tape reduction, it is the coalition that is committed to reducing the red tape. Instead of monthly, quarterly or six-monthly diesel fuel rebate returns, small businesses will no longer have to complete any separate forms under this initiative. So those forms - which could be monthly, quarterly or yearly - are gone. Small businesses will be able to claim the rebate as a part of the BAS and, under the initiative announced by the coalition in the budget, up to 750,000 ABN registered entities will have only one BAS, one GST payment, once a year.Let us compare that with the Labor Party, because I was asked by the member for Herbert about alternative policies. The Labor Party have their own version of the greenhouse gas emissions trading system, and Allen Consulting warned that it would destroy 15,000 jobs and cause an explosion in the price of fuels of up to 27 per cent. So let us get it right: under the coalition's policies, there are going to be more jobs, there will be cheaper fuel and it will be better for the environment; under the Labor Party's policies, there are going to be fewer jobs, it is going to cost more for fuel and it is not as good for the environment.  What does that mean for businesses and households? Under the Labor Party's proposal, power bills in Victoria would go up $203 a year; in New South Wales, up $209 a year; in Queensland, up $224 a year; in Western Australia, up $193 a year; in Tasmania, up $289; and in South Australia - get a load of this! - under Labor Party policy, power bills would go up $303 a year. It is pretty clear where the differences lie. The Labor Party believes in higher costs for businesses and higher costs for consumers; the coalition is committed to lower costs and more jobs. </DOC>

 - First, I thank the member for Cook for his question and the interest he shows in the future of the people of Iraq. The government welcomes the unanimous United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the strategy for Iraq's transition from dictatorship to a democratically elected government. The passage of this unanimous Security Council resolution was a clear display of international support for the people of Iraq. It simply reinforced the need for all of us as an international community to contribute to stability and the rehabilitation of Iraq after 35 years or so of dictatorship, United Nations sanctions and several wars that Iraq has been involved in of one kind or another. The resolution also underscores the steady progress that is being made in Iraq from tyranny to a better future, and I know all of us on this side of the House are very proud of the role that Australia has played in achieving that.My department produced last week a publication, Iraq: the path ahead, which I launched while I was in Brisbane, and I table that. I have sent copies around to many of our members of parliament and to other sections of the community because I think that through the fog of media discussion - not to criticise the media, but through the fog of that - it is important that the public have a clear idea of the direction of the Iraq strategy. It is also, I think, very heartening that there is so much support for Australia and what it is doing in Iraq itself. Iraqi interim President al-Yawar said on CNN last week - and members will be interested in this: `We appreciated all the help and assistance Australia has handed to Iraq. We'd really welcome having Australia participating in peacekeeping and stability in Iraq.'There is no question about it - we are committed to helping. Our policy is clear. We have 850 troops there; they will stay until the job is done. We have provided generous debt relief to Iraq and we have also contributed over $120 million in aid of one kind or another, some of which is humanitarian assistance, some of which is reconstruction assistance. And I am glad to say that the sort of position our government takes is the sort of position taken - on a much grander scale - in the United States by the Republican administration and the Democratic opposition. It is interesting that, obviously, the Labour government in the United Kingdom takes a very clear position on this issue, and in broad terms its position is -  An opposition member - It's going well! - well, not doing very well, you might say. The Conservatives are doing well, though, and they take the same position as us as well. So it is quite clear in the United Kingdom, as in the United States, that the major political parties do not wish to abandon the people of Iraq. It is quite clear, when it comes to alternative policies, that the Leader of the Opposition is indeed the odd man out here.There has been a lot of debate, I know, about what Labor's policy is in relation to our troops in Iraq. Now, let us try to remember what the Leader of the Opposition said. On the Mike Carlton show on 2UE on 23 March, he said:... we would be hoping to have them back by Christmas certainly.That is a clear statement. We know that it was not based on any briefing or any understanding of the situation there; it was just something that he concocted without even consulting his shadow cabinet - but there you are; he said it. And that has been the Leader of the Opposition's slogan ever since. Two days later on the Today show, he said:... our intentions have always been clear - always been clear! - and we've got a reasonable proposal there to have the troops home by Christmas.Well, a month passed, and on 7 April it was time for a bit of preparation to address the Lowy Institute. The Leader of the Opposition said to the Lowy Institute:... Labor has declared its intention of having the Australian troops home by Christmas.On 4 June, he put out a press release. He must have read it and given consideration to it. He said in his press release:We intend to have them - that is, the troops - home by Christmas.I would have thought no-one was in any doubt that the Leader of the Opposition has been going out there telling the Australian community that, if you vote for Labor, the troops will be home by Christmas. Only, in the last few days, we have learnt that the Leader of the Opposition has been having the public on. It is apparently not what he believes at all. First of all on 2UE, back on the Mike Carlton show, three months later he says in relation to troops needed to protect the Australian embassy in Baghdad, `It might mean leaving some troops there.' When people say, `That's funny; that's a backflip,' he says, `No, that was always our position going back to March.' If it was always the position, going back to March, why wasn't the Leader of the Opposition telling the Australian public that it was their position? Whatever the member for Griffith may have been saying, the Leader of the Opposition has been telling people that the troops would be out by Christmas.Remember, we have 846 troops in the Iraq theatre. The Labor Party revealed over the weekend that not only might it keep the 86 troops protecting the Australian embassy but it might keep the 160 military personnel involved in providing surveillance flights through the PC3s and it might keep the 175 sailors on board HMAS Stuart. So that means that, out of 846 troops, it might leave 425. So you have the Leader of the Opposition going around telling the Australian people that it is `troops out by Christmas' and then we find out that you might leave 425 of them behind. That is not having the troops out by Christmas. The point here is that the Leader of the Opposition is telling the Australian public one thing but proposing to do something else. I think the Leader of the Opposition's reputation for integrity is at stake here and he should get up and explain to the parliament and to the Australian public what his position really is. Apparently all the Leader of the Opposition wants to do is to bring back the C130s that provide essential supplies to Australian troops there, the 65 people involved in training Iraqis, the air traffic controllers and a few people working in what is now called the Coalition Provisional Authority. If that is the Labor Party's view let us hear that it is its view, because when this was put forward during the course of the last weekend, the Labor Party was running up to the press gallery trying to convince them that this had been Labor's policy since March. If this was Labor policy since March, why was the Leader of the Opposition going around telling the Australian people it would be `troops out by Christmas'? I think there is a lot of misleading going on here.</DOC>

 - To the best of my knowledge in relation to Hicks and Habib, we have no information that they have been maltreated in Guantanamo Bay, and that has been the focus of our concerns. As to whether the Red Cross have been concerned about maltreatment of Hicks and Habib at Guantanamo Bay, to the best of my knowledge I am not aware of the answer to that question - whether they were ever aware of maltreatment of them. In relation to the maltreatment of anyone else in Guantanamo Bay, I would have to check but - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question. In response I indicate that last Thursday the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that the unemployment rate for the month of May in Australia had fallen to 5.5 per cent. This is the lowest unemployment rate in Australia for 23 years. In addition to that low rate of 5.5 per cent, 80 per cent of jobs - eight in 10 jobs - created in Australia in the last 12 months have been full-time jobs. Indeed, more jobs have been created in Australia in the last six months under the coalition government than were created in the last six years under the Labor Party when it was last in government. This low rate of unemployment did not just happen naturally; it happened because of the strong, consistent and good economic management of the economy by the coalition government. I am asked about alternative policies. The greatest challenge to Australia's low rates of unemployment at the present time would be the propositions from the Australian Labor Party - from Latham Labor - to abolish Australian workplace agreements, to destroy casual employment in this country, to increase the unfair dismissal burden on business, to remove the secondary boycott provisions in the law and to increase the power of the union bosses. These are all things which would lead not to the creation of jobs in Australia but to the destruction of jobs for ordinary Australian men and women and insecurity for Australian families.We have the most left-wing agenda from the Leader of the Opposition when it comes to jobs. On the weekend he was at the Labor Party conference in Queensland, where he spoke again about the so-called `ladder of opportunity'. Of course, a rung was missing from the ladder of opportunity - the thing which is never mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition or the Labor Party - and that is jobs. If you do not have a job, then you do not have the first rung of opportunity in Australia. You cannot read to your children if you do not have the money to buy the books in the first place. The distaste of the Australian Labor Party for jobs - their refusal to look at the issue of jobs and employment - is quite remarkable. We know that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition suggested recently that people would be better off without a job rather than having casual employment - something which is quite shameful and absurd. Australia could not afford the reckless economic policy of the Australian Labor Party. They do not have a plan for jobs; they do not have a plan for creating more jobs for Australians. Their only plans would be bad for business and bad for workers. They would be bad for all Australians.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Lilley for his question. It gives me an opportunity to inform the Australian parliament and the Australian public that this week a $600 payment will be going to all Australian families who are eligible for family tax benefit. You can never rely on the comments made by the member for Lilley. Indeed, the system is absolutely transparent. All families who are eligible for FTB will be getting that $600 payment. Likewise, those who are eligible for FTB will be getting that $600 payment next year. The question that Australian families should be asking the shadow spokesperson is: will the Australian Labor Party guarantee this payment in the 2005-06 financial year?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. AusLink is, in simple terms, Australia's first ever national land transport plan. Since Federation we have never been able to achieve this. Now we have one before us. It is made necessary by very strong economic growth. Increased prosperity in Australia is leading to people moving around a lot more in a private capacity. It is also leading to a very strong growth in freight volumes moving around the country. It is estimated that, over the next 20 years, we will see a doubling in freight movements across Australia and a 40 per cent increase in private passenger movements. So it is made necessary by strong economic growth, but it is made possible by careful economic management under this government over the last eight years. Over the next five years we will see expenditure of $11.8 billion which, coincidentally, is around twice what was spent on the Snowy Mountains Scheme in today's money. That will mean $7.7 billion for the new AusLink national network, $1.5 billion for the AusLink Roads to Recovery program, $2.6 billion in untied local roads grants and $90 million under the national black spot program to fix dangerous locations on our roads.Additionally, following the successful signing-off of the Australian Rail Track Corporation lease over the designated interstate rail track in New South Wales and the Hunter Valley track, we will see the pre-announced expenditure of some $872 million there in upgrading the track in New South Wales. This is because we must now strategically take forward the development of both road and rail and make certain we end the old intermodal rivalries and stand-offs which denied us a coherent approach to transport planning and strategies in this country. Quite simply, with the very large increases in freight volumes coming at us, there will be a lot more for both road and rail. The more we crowd it all onto one sector, namely road, and the more taxpayers' money we put into roads, the more we will find we are just treading water and people simply will not be able to move on our major highways.I have been delighted with the reception given to AusLink from many quarters. The Australian Local Government Association president commented that it `is a vital nation-building initiative'. The NRMA chief, Ross Turnbull, welcomed AusLink funding. He said that it will save lives and make our economy more competitive and that it is very timely that we are now addressing the integration of road and rail at a national level and identifying strategic freight corridors so that we can plan properly for the future.We have achieved not only what Labor could never do in government but what it appeared to have absolutely no commitment to in opposition. All we have had is some rhetorical bleating. What was very noticeable was that, when we first announced it, there were Labor Party ministers all over the country floundering around for a response. We had one Labor minister saying, `This is obviously politically motivated because all the roads go through coalition seats,' at precisely the same time as another roads minister said, `It is obviously politically motivated because none of the roads go through Labor Party seats.' -  - Sorry, because they all go through Labor Party seats. He said the opposite thing. After a couple of days, it was obvious they had coordinated their message and they were all saying that it was not enough. These are huge increases in order to meet a very real national need. At the same time as the member for Batman says, `We'll have some new body which will ensure that it is handsoff and governments have nothing to do with saying where the money will go,' in the same breath he says, `We'll do a dodgy deal with the pack - with Scully, Batchelor and Lucas.' The fact is that, in the end, our money is on the table. The member for Batman should tell his state Labor colleagues to stop political point-scoring and get on with the job. We have real resources on the table to give Australians what they need and deserve: a proper transport strategy for the future - and the Labor Party ought to get on and make it a reality for Australians.</DOC>

 - I would like to inform the member for Lilley that no, the government has not changed it. Indeed, one of the things we are very conscious of is to maintain that there is real value for that $600 payment that will be made not just by 30 June but also every year after to those families eligible for family tax benefit. I think the concern that members of parliament and the public that might be watching this broadcast today should have is with this constant scaremongering by the Australian Labor Party where they are still refusing to put through this payment in years beyond 2004-05. Indeed, the shadow spokesperson for finance has again refused to endorse that the Labor Party will back the government's position where a $600 payment will be made on the base rate and the minimum rate from every day forward.The only concern that I think Australian families should have here is the refusal by the Australian Labor Party to guarantee that increase of $600 to family tax benefit clients for future years beyond 2004-05. Indeed, the payments will begin this week. This is a very generous payment that we will be making to all families along with carer payments to those who are eligible.</DOC>

 - I appreciate the member for Makin asking me this question because it is an important subject. I know that all members of the House are concerned to protect the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Let me make it very clear that, in negotiating the free trade agreement with the United States, the government was very concerned not to prejudice any aspect of the operation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Let me make it clear also that, under the free trade agreement, drug prices to consumers will not rise, the PBS legislation will not change, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee will remain the gatekeeper to the system and cost effectiveness will remain the criteria against which applications to list a drug will be judged.The government has agreed to an independent review process, but all that can happen under this process is that the PBAC might be asked to look again at a particular application. I want to make it clear that, if a drug is not cost effective, it will not and should not be listed; if it is cost effective, it will and should be listed. Under the free trade agreement, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee remains the judge and the Australian parliament remains sovereign over the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I call on members opposite to swallow their anti-American bile and get behind the free trade agreement. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for that question. My attention has been drawn to the statements made by the South Australian minister and reported in today's Adelaide Advertiser. The minister said:The time to talk is over, and immediate action is needed to secure environmental flows to the Murray.I totally agree with the South Australian minister, and this issue is listed for discussion at the COAG meeting on 25 June. That meeting is a very important meeting for water in Australia and for restoring the health of the Murray River. The Commonwealth government has worked extremely hard, particularly through the good offices of the Deputy Prime Minister, who has done an outstanding job on this issue. He has been trying to secure two intergovernmental agreements - first, on a national water initiative which will set out the framework which will drive water reform for the next decade and beyond, and second, the Living Murray initiative, which will unlock assistance of up to $500 million to restore health to the Murray-Darling Basin. If the states of Australia are genuinely committed and willing to forge a visionary cooperative arrangement at the meeting on 25 June, then we can achieve a historic breakthrough. But the 25 June meeting is a make or break meeting. We cannot go on talking about this issue forever, and I can sympathise with the views of the South Australian minister, who wants the talk to end and some action to start. It will require a level of agreement between the different states of Australia that has not so far been forthcoming. The Australian public want this fixed. They do not want further delay, they do not want further procrastination; they want this issue fixed. I hope that everybody who comes to the meeting on 25 June will do so not for the purpose of giving forth further delay and procrastination but to actually reach a final decision so that the governments can sign off and we can promise - particularly to the people of South Australia - some real reform, some real expenditure and some real dealing with many of the issues relating to the Murray-Darling Basin that have waited far too long for a Commonwealth-state agreement.</DOC>

 - I have to say to the Leader of the Opposition: I think that is something for parents. I thought the Leader of the Opposition was interested in parental responsibility. There has got to be a limit, you know. - We have a lot of advertising bans in this country -  -  - Not enough, say some people opposite - and I think governments have to be very reluctant to embrace too willingly the nanny state in banning this, that or the other. The question of what children eat is ultimately the responsibility of their parents, and it is about time that the Leader of the Opposition stood up for parental responsibility instead of trying to throw everything over to the government. We will never build a nation of independent, proud, self-reliant people until we reinforce - indeed revive - the notion of parental responsibility for their children.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question. I can inform the House that as a result of the most recent budget the government announced an increase in carers payment and carers allowance. Over 400,000 Australians who look after others will be receiving that increase. The payment of the increase to carers will start being received by them, in their bank accounts, as of today. In addition, nearly two million Australian families will be receiving an increase of $600 in respect of the family tax benefit for each child per annum. That is not just for this year but every year thereafter. I can inform the House that the number of families and carers that will receive their payments in their bank accounts today is expected to be 613,000, with the remainder going out over the next few days.This is being paid electronically, so I urge people to have a look at their bank accounts and check that the payments have been made. The government will be following up with notices in the newspapers so that people know they have received this money. I urge anybody who has not received their entitlement to contact Family and Community Services. It is important, of course, that they know they get this payment, because if there were a change of government these payments could well be taken away from Australian families. No doubt the Australian Labor Party would prefer it if people did not know that they were eligible for an additional $600, because under the Australian Labor Party there is no guarantee at all that these payments will continue. Indeed, the member for Fraser has said that you could expect your payment in 2004-05 but will give no guarantee that the payment will continue thereafter.We await with great interest the release by the Australian Labor Party of their tax policy. Remember this: their tax policy is going to give broad tax relief to everybody, it is going to fund an intergenerational fund, it is going to leave a bigger surplus and it is going to enable the Australian Labor Party to spend more. They will take less, spend more and have more left over at the end of it. The whole of Australia now breathlessly awaits this tax policy. There is now a concerted campaign by the Leader of the Opposition to hide his policies from the Australian public. Why do I say that? I say that because the Leader of the Opposition promised that he would release Labor's tax policy in the week of the budget. - I thank the honourable member for Grayndler. If he goes to the ALP web site he will find a transcript that has not yet been airbrushed. Could somebody log in, because they normally start changing these things at this point. - It was an interview with Jon Faine on radio 3LO, 774 ABC in Melbourne. The Leader of the Opposition said that in Labor's first term in government they will be giving tax relief. He said:... for PAYE tax payers as they go into higher brackets there is an ongoing argument for relief.Faine asked:So you would change the bracket limits? The thresholds? Latham answered:You will find these things out in budget week.He could not have been clearer than that. It is in the transcript. It is now five weeks since the budget reply was given, and every day that the Leader of the Opposition comes in here and thinks he can divert public attention by talking about the advertising of junk food or through some such stunt is a day when he keeps his policies hidden from the Australian people. The Australian people were promised Labor's tax policy in budget week. They want to know how it is you can spend more, take less, have more left over and fund an intergenerational fund. I was very interested to see that in the Financial Review today, in an article by Mike Davis about Howard's FTA, a Labor figure is quoted as saying:If an election was called tomorrow, we could release our policy.Why not do it now? Why not let the Australian public in on this great secret? - I love the way the member for Lalor comes in on target - on time and on target and hopelessly off the mark, over and over again. I remind the Australian Labor Party that the reason they elected the member for Werriwa as their leader is they did not want to have a small target strategy. - Tell us about 1996, they say. They did not want to follow the small target strategy. He was going to be big and bold and ambitious: almost Whitlamite in the scope of the policies which he was going to lay before the Australian people. And yet we see him shrivelling and hiding and cutting and running. Access Economics has now delivered costings to the Australian Labor Party. The senior Labor figure now says the policy is prepared. John Faine was promised the policy in budget week. This is going to be the mother of all policies, and the only people who are not let in on the secret are the Australian people. They want to know what Labor stands for and they deserve to know now.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, because it gives me an opportunity to announce to the Australian people that there will be a round 10 of the Dairy Regional Assistance Program and so a significant number of dairy communities will again be able to benefit from this program, which has provided significant help through dairy restructuring. While Labor at state level has refused to do anything to help dairy farmers through their current difficulty - refused to do anything to help dairy communities facing the problems of restructuring - this government has provided significant funds to help those communities open new industries and recover from the impacts of dairy deregulation. There is some funding available because some projects did not proceed, so we have decided to have a 10th - and hopefully final - round of the Dairy Regional Assistance Program. We want that money to work as quickly as possible. I can most certainly confirm that I have asked the department to take whatever steps it can to get this money to communities as quickly as possible. Therefore, applications will be called for soon. They will be considered promptly so that this money can work for Australian rural communities and deliver real outcomes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Solomon. I know that he and many of his constituents understand the tremendous benefits that Australia will reap from a free trade agreement with the United State - as we will from free trade agreements with Thailand and Singapore, neither of which are apparently a subject of debate or controversy.I am indeed aware of reports of a yet to be publicly released study by an ANU academic called Philippa Dee, who claims that the free trade agreement with the United States will delay generic medicines entering into the market and thereby increase the cost of pharmaceuticals in Australia. She also argues that a copyright term extension from 50 years to 70 years in the agreement will result in a long-term $700 million cost to the Australian economy.Both of these conclusions are false. First, there is no provision in the free trade agreement for a delay in the introduction of generic drugs. There is only provision for a greater transparency of process. There are no additional intellectual property rights granted to patent holders and there is nothing in the agreement that would change the price of drugs. Secondly, because it is a separate point, the claim of $700 million as a cost to the economy as a result of the extension of the copyright term from 50 to 70 years is based on completely unrealistic assumptions. Most copyright material is out of circulation well before the 50-year period is up. Books, CDs, DVDs and computer software are hardly likely to still be in circulation after either 50 or 70 years and therefore the copyright provisions are not going to be terribly relevant once these particular products are redundant. Dr Dee's apparent failure to allow for the real diminishing value of copyright material inevitably produces her completely unrealistic results.The honourable member asked whether there were any other views. Yet again I bring to the House the views of the Leader of the Opposition. I bring yet again to the House another example of the Leader of the Opposition misleading the Australian people in a very deliberate way. The Leader of the Opposition was on The World Today program this Monday and he said:The advice going through to the Senate committee ... indicates that Australia would have to pay $700 million in royalties as a product of the trade agreement -  that is, the free trade agreement with the United States.These are royalties that come out of our pharmaceutical schemes. $700 million extra cost to pharmaceuticals in Australia is a big amount.Not even Philippa Dee is claiming that the $700 million relates to pharmaceuticals. It relates to copyright - to DVDs, to CDs, to books - not to pharmaceuticals. That is what the $700 million is about. We repudiate that figure - but it is about copyright; it is not about the patents of pharmaceuticals. The Leader of the Opposition has picked up a $700 million figure that relates to copyright and has pretended to the Australian people that that $700 million would be the increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals. That is a disgraceful, dishonest and misleading thing to have told the Australian people.The ABC is not normally - if I may say so, Prime Minister - a great supporter of the Howard government, but the ABC reporter on The World Today said that Mr Latham:... clearly hasn't actually read the report and he's been poorly briefed on its contents.That is what the ABC said. For the ABC to suggest that the Leader of the Opposition is misleading, he must have been very deeply misleading. The fact is, though, that the `2UE troops out' policy of the Leader of the Opposition is misleading, there is deception and there is dishonesty associated with the articulation of that policy. And here we have seen it yet again on the free trade agreement with the United States, where what has been is revealed is not only the dishonesty of the Leader of the Opposition but also his visceral anti-Americanism.</DOC>

 - As I mentioned earlier, this has been a very popular program, and a lot of members, particularly from this side of the House - and, I might add, some from the other side of the House - have argued strongly that funds should be spent in their electorates. It would not surprise me in the least if the three members mentioned by the honourable member for Corio have been amongst those who have been lobbying to have money spent in their electorates, because they are all good, faithful, hardworking local members. Labor are always against providing any assistance to rural and regional areas. In their budget reply there was no response whatsoever to the needs of regional areas. The only commitment we have got so far out of the member for Corio in relation to agricultural policy is a promise to slash the funding for ABARE and to abolish the BRS. There are no commitments from Labor to help regional and rural communities. This government have demonstrated their willingness to support dairy farmers and indeed others facing difficulties. We will continue to do everything we possibly can. When the round is advertised, there will be opportunities for anyone who believes they have a worthwhile project that meets the criteria to have that project properly considered on its merits.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Flinders for his question. The member for Flinders, who is a Victorian member, has been very concerned about issues relating to corruption as they have been raised in Victoria. The Commonwealth has today made clear its approach in relation to allegations of corruption in police services. Insofar as any allegations of corruption might arise in relation to the Commonwealth, we have said that we will establish an independent national body with appropriate powers, including telephone intercept powers if required, to address corruption if such allegations are made.I want to stress to the House that there have been no allegations of systematic corruption within any Commonwealth agency. That relates to the Australian Federal Police or any other Commonwealth law enforcement agency. In relation to the Australian Crime Commission, which is a joint agency of the Commonwealth and states, the only suggestion that I am aware of is that those about whom it has been suggested that corruption is being raised have been officers of state police forces seconded to that agency. The government have determined that, should such allegations arise, they are to be dealt with. For that reason, we sought to improve the accountability and anticorruption capacity of both the ACC and the AFP. We see the establishment of a national anticorruption body as a further demonstration of a commitment to deal with such issues if they arise.I have been asked to address the broader question in relation to police corruption. This is a serious issue in Victoria, as I think all members are aware. In response to that, I have received from the Victorian Premier a request to give interception powers to the Victorian Ombudsman. I might say that that request was received after the Victorian Premier had announced that he intended to give the Ombudsman such power without any awareness that, under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act - which I am sure all members of this parliament are familiar with - that power resides in the Commonwealth. Members of this House and of the Senate have taken considerable interest in the way in which that power is used, and they have been anxious to ensure that there are appropriate accountability arrangements in place to ensure that the interception power is not used abusively.In relation to his request, I have given an undertaking to the Premier of Victoria that, if Victoria is prepared to establish an effective, independent commission to deal with police corruption, it will have that power. That is the point I have made. I have made it very clear that such powers have been given to independent commissions in Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland and that, if a request were made for a like body in Victoria, that request would be acceded to. But the request in relation to an ombudsman ought to be understood as a very significant widening of the power of telephone interceptions to what is in effect an administrative body. The one body that is charged with the responsibility of ensuring that interception powers are not used abusively is in fact the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman has to test whether or not police with telephone interception powers use them correctly, or, if an anticorruption body gets them, the Ombudsman tests whether or not the powers have been used appropriately. Here we have in Victoria the suggestion that we should give to the Police Ombudsman, who is the same person as the Victorian Ombudsman, the power to intercept telephones and that that person would also be the person charged to ensure that the power was used appropriately. It would undermine the credibility of the supervision of telephone interception powers if we were to accede to that Victorian request. For that reason, we are not prepared to do so. But those people who think you can charge the Commonwealth with not being interested in the issue of police corruption ought to understand that we would give an independent body that power and assist fully in ensuring that the powers are implemented expeditiously. If the Victorian parliament could come back before September, we would work to ensure that that happened. Let me say that, if any allegations are seriously going to be raised in relation to the Commonwealth, it ought to be known that the Commonwealth would act expeditiously to deal with those matters. We have made that clear by indicating that we are working to establish a framework in which there would be such a body if allegations were raised.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first question from the honourable member for Corio about the proportionate distribution to particular electorates is no. The figures are wrong; that is not the percentage that has gone to particular members. The honourable member is clearly endeavouring to suggest that somehow or other the money has been distorted in a way that does not provide the maximum benefit to the dairy communities affected. Before this money was distributed, criteria were outlined -  - as to where the priority areas would be for the Dairy Regional Assistance Program. It was very clearly stated that the areas to receive priority were those where there would be the greatest impact as a result of dairy deregulation. An independent report was prepared by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics which went through each of the dairying areas in Australia and identified the areas of disadvantage that would be created though dairy deregulation. It so happens that three out of the five shires most affected by dairy deregulation are in my own electorate. The other two are in New South Wales. It also happens that, of those three in my own electorate, one has now been redistributed into the electorate of the honourable member for Hinkler. But, putting that aside, the reality is that the funds were always to be targeted to those areas that were most affected by dairy deregulation. It is also self-evident that the states of Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia were going to be more affected by dairy deregulation because of their high dependence on the market milk sector and that states like Victoria, which had by far the biggest proportion of production but had production directed to the manufacturing sector, were going to be less affected. It was always intended that the funding would be targeted to the most affected areas.The final point I want to make, and this is very important, is that the decisions in relation to the particular projects chosen went through a rigorous process. Firstly, they had to be approved by the local area consultative committees as meeting the priorities and as being the targeted types of projects which we intended to support. They were then independently evaluated by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, which went through each of the projects, looking at their relative merits and ensuring that they were commercially viable and likely to achieve their objectives. There is no instance where I have sought to overrule the department in relation to the priorities that it set, and certainly not in any case which affected my own electorate. You will find that all of the records on this are completely above reproach and honourable. Indeed, audit reports et cetera have confirmed that the management of this program, very substantial as it was, met the highest possible standards.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for his question. I appreciate the interest he has in the Australian Defence Force personnel serving in Iraq. The Australian C130 Hercules aircraft contingent there has about 150 personnel involved. They are performing vital tasks - not, as the Leader of the Opposition suggested some time ago, symbolic tasks. The C130 aircraft are the lifeline for the Australian representative office, the Australian Embassy, in Baghdad. They transport the troops who guard the Australian Embassy. They transported the equipment, including armoured vehicles, and they transport supplies. In fact, those aircraft, between February 2003 and March 2004, have transported 4.5 million kilograms of supplies. They also transport Australian officials engaged in rehabilitation operations. In 400 missions, they have moved 9,300 people.I think the House will be interested, and I know many members will be proud, to hear that our aircraft have been involved in 925 aeromedical evacuations of wounded coalition personnel. That demonstrates that they are not doing a symbolic job but doing a real and very important job. They are vital - and the Prime Minister is very aware of this - because they have advanced countermeasures against shoulder launched missiles. The Prime Minister's experience on one of these aircraft was of an emergency because of fear of a missile being launched. I would remind the Prime Minister that I had the same experience myself. These are very good aircraft, with that sort of capability. Obviously, if civilian aircraft were used to perform the same tasks they would be unarmed, they would not have this kind of advanced countermeasures capability and they would be deeply vulnerable flying in and out of Baghdad airport.Are there any alternative policies? As usual, there is the Leader of the Opposition's policy. He has his 2UE `troops out' policy. He intends to have the troops home by Christmas, he said in his 4 June press release - but he is considering leaving half of the troops there. He has obviously been telling the truth in the 4 June press release. He plans to leave the Australian representative office security detail there, the P3Cs and HMAS Stuart. The Leader of the Opposition says `We want to play a role in the reconstruction of Iraq but we'll do that through economic, humanitarian and civilian aid' and leave half of the troops there apparently as well. But the shadow minister for defence said in a speech on 21 May that Labor intends to withdraw the C130 Hercules detachment. So the Hercules are going under Labor. That is part of the `troops out by Christmas' component of the 2UE `troops out' policy. In which case, how would a Labor government supply the troops left, how would it conduct rotations and how would it get advisers in and out of Iraq? Would a Latham Labor government use commercial flights? - Don't spoil all my lines! Would they use commercial flights? The DFAT travel advice says:Due to the risk of surface-to-air attacks ... Australians are advised against air travel over Iraq ... without self-protection capabilities.A Labor government, surely, would stick to the DFAT travel advice. Perhaps they would use the road. The DFAT travel advice says:Travel by road in Iraq remains hazardous and is not recommended, as underlined by recent incidents of convoys of vehicles coming under fire.It appears that the Leader of the Opposition's `troops home by Christmas' policy is going to be `troops stranded by Christmas' - 86 troops guarding the Australian embassy and officials left stranded without Hercules support. Could it be that, having promised to cut and run from Iraq, the Latham Labor government will go to none other than the United States of America and say, `Please could you help us?' I hate to think that the Leader of the Opposition on becoming Prime Minister would go on his knees to the White House asking for support for Australians in Iraq, having cut and run! The fact is that all of this demonstrates a serious point: nothing has been properly thought through by the opposition. It has just been blurted out on 2UE by the Leader of the Opposition, and the shadow ministers have had to try and piece together the shambles left by the Leader of the Opposition - a Leader of the Opposition who to this very day has still not had a briefing on what our troops do in Iraq. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wills for his question. That question reveals that the Labor Party is prepared to push and promote policies which are quite irresponsible in terms of their job-destroying impact on the Australian economy. The member for Wills has indicated before and is now trying to imply in the question that somehow or other the government might support the Labor Party's policy. Let me assure him: the government will not and never would have supported such a policy to impose $11 billion in costs on Australian households and Australian businesses. It is a policy that is designed not to target the specific problems that renewable energies have in coming into the marketplace, as we have done in yesterday's energy statement; it is a policy to give a completely undifferentiated, massive, cost-raising, job-destroying subsidy that is without justification.It is quite clear after yesterday that the government and the opposition are going down two completely different tracks in relation to putting Australia in an environmentally sound energy position. The government has shown that it is possible to put in place win-win policies: low-cost policies that will achieve outstanding environmental outcomes for Australia and policies that will create jobs. The Labor Party, on the other hand, is committing itself to high tax policies that will put up prices. Let me illustrate some of this. The Labor Party wants, as we know, to ratify the deeply flawed Kyoto protocol and impose a national emissions trading system, which is in effect a carbon tax. The Labor Party believes that the best way to move the Australian economy ahead and to create jobs is to impose new taxes, in this case a carbon tax. - We have recently had an analysis of the impact of such a tax which Allen Consulting prepared for the Victorian government, probably as a report secretly prepared for the Australian Labor Party. The effect of the tax is to raise annual electricity prices. That is what the report said - it could raise electricity prices by up to 27 per cent. That is $193 for every household in Victoria, $209 a year in New South Wales, $224 a year in Queensland, $270 a year in the ACT, $289 a year in Tasmania and $303 a year in South Australia. That is what the Labor Party's approach is - to put up people's electricity prices, to impose costs on households, to impose costs on businesses and to claim at the same time that this is necessary to create a clean Australia. It is not, and we have demonstrated that in our energy policy.  - The New Zealand government, who have moved down the emissions trading track, have come clean in a published document showing what the costs of emissions trading would be in New Zealand. They estimated that this scheme, which the Labor Party is committed to, could raise electricity prices by 16 per cent and - listen to this - could raise petrol prices by 6c a litre. So on top of the increased electricity prices we now have increased petrol prices as a result of the carbon taxes that the Labor Party is proposing. - A wide gulf has now opened up between the irresponsible, foolish policies on the other side of the House and the smart policies that this government have put forward to give Australia a sustainable, low emissions energy system into the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question. I can inform him that, as part of the AusLink announcement which was made last week, Victoria will receive $1.4 billion, including a 118 per cent increase in its construction budget for roads under the AusLink program. Can I also acknowledge that, as part of that, a ring road or bypass will be built around the city of Geelong and that will be funded for $186 million by the Commonwealth government. I want to pay tribute to and acknowledge the work that the member for Corangamite did in lobbying for that road - ceaselessly lobbying the Treasurer, lobbying the Deputy Prime Minister and lobbying the Prime Minister. I can honestly say that, if it had not been for the member for Corangamite, the government would not have seen the necessity and been able to commit to that road. -  - I am rather interested by the interjections because some in the Labor Party seem to be suggesting that the road was not required. I give them the opportunity to now put their interjections on the record against the Geelong ring road or the Geelong bypass. - I can inform the discontents on the Labor back bench that no sooner had Stewart McArthur won the ring road for Geelong than the member for Werriwa hotfooted it down there to say, `Me too,' and to actually agree with the proposition. So it ill behoves the Labor Party to be interjecting.In addition to that, the Labor Party also followed the government in its commitment to the Calder Highway and in relation to the Deer Park bypass. But there is actually one road that we have never heard a Labor Party commitment on; there is one road that the Labor Party in Victoria ominously stays very silent about. It is a road that is very dear to the hearts of the member for Aston and the member for Deakin and the member for Dunkley and the member for Casey - in fact, the people of the eastern suburbs. Dare it speak its name? It is the Scoresby `Free'-way. The reason I raise the Scoresby Freeway is that the Scoresby Freeway is a road of national importance, just like the Geelong ring road. It is under an agreement for fifty-fifty construction. Here is the agreement for the Scoresby transport corridor. I think I have probably tabled it in the House before. Clause 3(a) states:...Victoria agrees to provide 50% of Government costs for the construction of a freeway...Clause 3(d) states:Victoria undertakes to ensure that users of the Scoresby Freeway will not be required to pay a direct toll.And clause 5(a):Implementation of the Freeway project is the responsibility of the Victorian Government.In the AusLink proposal, we have set aside $445 million for the Scoresby Freeway to honour this agreement, but I am yet to hear any announcement from federal Labor as to what Labor's policy is on the Scoresby Freeway. There is absolute silence.The member for Batman, who is responsible for these matters, was actually asked by the Sunday Age what the position of federal Labor was on the Scoresby Freeway. On Sunday, 13 June, he was asked his view and Labor's policy on the Scoresby Freeway. He had lots to say about Deer Park, he had lots to say about Geelong and he had lots to say about Calder, but he was asked by the press about Scoresby, and he was struck by an awful silence. It was most uncanny - a bit like the silence enveloping the House now. He was struck by an awful silence. He was asked if Labor will come clean about their plan in relation to Scoresby. According to the article, Mr Ferguson `said Scoresby is a dispute that should be resolved between the federal and state governments'.Labor wants to be the federal government. Wouldn't Labor actually tell us how it could be resolved? There are two ways of resolving the dispute about the Scoresby Freeway. Steve Bracks can honour his word, Labor can observe the agreement, Victoria can spend the $445 million and the people of the eastern suburbs can have a freeway - or it can be resolved Labor's way: Steve Bracks breaks his word, Victoria rips up this agreement, the people of the eastern suburbs do not get a freeway and every single day of their lives, as they drive down those roads, they will pay a toll as the price of Labor's broken promise. It can be resolved one of two ways, but the extraordinary thing is that federal Labor has no position in relation to this. Federal Labor sits ominously silent. It will not guarantee the money. It will not say that it will abide by the agreement. It will not condemn the Bracks government. All it says is that it should be resolved one way or the other. I make this point for another reason. Labor promised a freeway in Scoresby before a state election, it took the money away and it now wants to put a toll on. Why should Labor be believed on any of its other road promises? If Mr Ferguson, the member for Batman, cannot condemn the Bracks government for walking away from funding, how can Labor be believed on any other road promise? How do we know that the promises that Labor makes on Calder or Deer Park are not Scoresby promises? How do we know that? Until Labor has the decency to honour this agreement, to repudiate the Scoresby promise, Labor cannot be believed and Labor stands absolutely condemned. Labor Party members ought to get some steel in their spine and stand up for the people of the eastern suburbs, who ought to know this - that it is only the Liberal Party that is interested in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne.</DOC>

 - I remember very well the statement that was made by my colleague, and it has been made very clear by him and the government that we do not favour an advertising ban. Nothing that he has said in any way alters what I said - that is, that the overwhelming responsibility for the dietary habits of children belongs to parents. The Leader of the Opposition can drag out press statements and he can ask questions as often as he likes about this, but I know that the overwhelming majority of the Australian people would agree with me when I say that, when it comes to the behaviour of children, when it comes to the sporting activities of children, when it comes to the dietary habits of children, when it comes to the learning habits of children, the people overwhelmingly responsible are the parents of those children.This government, as distinct from the Australian Labor Party, will never see the state or the government standing in the shoes of parents. We believe that parents have the overwhelming right to shape the lives of their children. When government starts saying to parents that it is no longer as much your responsibility but that it is rather a community responsibility, it sends a signal to the parents of this country that governments have a different view about their role. There is nothing more important in the relationships of this country than the relationships of trust between parents and children. You only reinforce that relationship of trust if you recognise that it carries with it the responsibility of teaching, nurturing and, above all, loving their children.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macarthur for his question. I know how interested he and his constituents are in a cleaner future for Australia. Securing Australia's energy future, the far-reaching statement that the government issued yester-day, prepares Australia for a lower emissions future, using a range of new technologies from power generation and transport, and it does so in a way that recognises Australia's unique circumstances and the unique opportunities that this country has in terms of power generation. It looks for win-win solutions, reducing taxes and regulation, encouraging jobs and unapologetically promoting economic growth together with environmental sustainability, showing that these two can be entirely compatible - something that those on the other side of the House have great difficulty grasping. This vision for a cleaner and sustainable energy sector creates unprecedented opportunities for all cleaner energy sources, whether they be clean coal or gas technologies, or abundant renewables such as the wind and the sun. One of the most exciting policies to come out of the government's statement is the $75 million solar cities project, which has the capacity to identify and overcome the major barriers to the installation of this renewable and distributed energy source. One of the most important features of the solar cities project is that it is going to tackle the planning and regulatory obstacles that presently exist to the widespread installation of solar power.I noticed that the headline of the Adelaide Advertiser earlier this week described the city as `sun city'. Of course, Adelaide is a city which has got the sunshine and will benefit greatly from this particular program, because householders in cities like Adelaide will have the opportunity to experiment with new technology and new metering techniques - time-of-use meters on both households and commercial premises - that will allow us to have energy prices reflect the full and real costs of the distribution of energy provision. During peak load, when solar energy output is often at its highest, electricity from the grid can be a hundred times the average price. These meters will allow consumers to adjust their energy use to when it costs less and to realise the full rewards of becoming more energy efficient.Now, I am delighted to say that this project has really excited people in the solar energy industry, and I noticed on PM last night that Andy Hughes of the Australian and New Zealand Solar Energy Society said, `the $75 million solar cities trial is a big step forward'. He went on to say:I'm very excited about the solar cities program and money for PV's, photovoltaics on roof can only be a good thing, and any money spent on energy efficiency in the home is also money well spent. Every dollar spent to save energy is two dollars saved in infrastructure.While this statement is completely neutral as to the different energies, I also want to draw attention to the statement today by Green Pacific Energy, which reaffirmed its commitment to an $800 million investment program in renewable power generation across Australia, following the Prime Minister's energy statement. Green Pacific Energy said, `We believe that the outlook for clean green energy is extremely positive and that the government's policy initiative provides a sound long-term environment to encourage the take-up of renewable energy.'These are good strong endorsements and they contrast with the destructive policies - the high-cost, high-tax, new regulatory policies - that the Labor Party is proposing, which are going to damage this country and in fact undermine the possibility of a sustainable environmental future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. The initiative by Sydney University is one that it has taken upon itself. What it wants to do in the middle of Sydney is to transfer undergraduate nursing across to the University of Technology Sydney and the Australian Catholic University. In the words of the Vice-Chancellor of the university, Professor Gavin Brown, in an article in obiter dictum which is yet to be published, `The total number of undergraduate nursing places available in metropolitan Sydney would increase.' The other point that ought to be made here is that Sydney University, along with another 37 universities in this country, is offering full fee paying places to international foreign students. There are 136,000 foreign students paying their own way fully through Australian universities. One of the proposals Sydney University is proposing for postgraduate nursing, which it wants to consolidate, is that international students would be able to pay full fees. The Labor Party's plan, should it get into government, is to ban Australians who are eligible for entry into their own universities from paying full fees through Australian higher education. Apparently under Labor, the only way that an Australian could pay their own way in an Australian university - even with expanded HECS places - would be to go overseas, sell their passport and come back as a foreigner. I might also point out for the benefit of the opposition that the member for Jagajaga in the Australian newspaper today is reassuring Sydney University that it will be fully compensated not only for the $30 million in additional HECS it will attract over the next four years but also for the additional $20 million that it would receive from Australian full fee paying students.  - That means the universities will be compensated $350 million for banning Australians from paying full fees in their own universities, but we cannot find it anywhere in the costings for Labor's policy.</DOC>

 - That is a good question from the member for Canning. It is a question about small business. I am still waiting for my first question about small business from the Labor Party in three years. -  - I am sorry. I have been asked one question about small business by the Labor Party in the last three years, but a number have been asked by the member for Canning, because he cares about small business, particularly in Western Australia. Today in Western Australia - and this will dismay the member for Canning - the Industrial Relations Commission had a submission put to it by the trade union movement to extend redundancy payments to Western Australian awards. Under current arrangements, redundancy payments are not mandatory for small business but, under the proposal put forward by the industrial wing of the Labor Party, every small business will have to provide 16 weeks of redundancy payments to employees. That could be $15,000 for a senior tradesperson or $9,000 for a shop assistant who is made redundant. Where is a small business going to get that sort of money? Under the Labor Party proposal, every small business could potentially be slugged between $9,000 and $15,000 under certain circumstances.This follows a trend in Western Australia under the Labor Party - a trend that applies to parental leave; a trend that applies to casual employment; a trend that applies to AWAs; a trend that applies to the entry of union representatives into workplaces without notice. It is no surprise that under the industrial regime of the Labor Party in Western Australia more than 100,000 Australian workplace agreements have been lodged by Western Australian employers since April 2002. Understand that. There has been a movement of 100,000 employers from the state system in Western Australia, run by the Labor Party, to the federal system seeking a safe refuge from the Labor Party's industrial laws. There are only 126,000 small businesses in Western Australia, and in the last two years 100,000 businesses have moved from the state system to the federal system. If there should happen to be a change of government at the next federal election, there would be no safe haven for business or its employees. It will be coast to coast labour laws and coast to coast industrial laws set by the union movement and enacted by the Labor Party - coast to coast! There will be no safe haven for employees or employers who want to negotiate in good faith, because the federal Labor Party want to abolish the Australian workplace agreements that are part and parcel of the everyday life of 100,000 Western Australian small businesses. It says everything about the Labor Party that they want to close down small business; they want to close down the relationship between an employer and an employee. Under Labor in federal government there would be no safe haven for anyone who wants to cut a deal with their boss.</DOC>

 - Can I say in reply to the member for Calare that I will examine the details of the impact on the local community of that particular decision. I would have thought, off the top of my head, that there were some differences in the size of the redundancies involved in the two cases and the relevant impact.Could I take the opportunity, while I am on my feet, of saying something about labour market conditions in the honourable member's electorate. The unemployment rate in Calare stood at 5.1 per cent at the end of last year. That is an improvement from the rate of 6.7 per cent that obtained in March 1996, and there had been a peak of 8.4 per cent in June 1993. There have been a number of recent government announcements which are of benefit to the honourable member's electorate. For example, the government committed $10 million to assist with the upgrade of the Mount Panorama motor racing circuit. The total upgrade of that circuit is worth $24 million, and it recognises the important contribution the Bathurst 1000 makes to the regional economy.Calare will also be a significant beneficiary of the recent Roads to Recovery program and also the broader AusLink program. Since 1996, $130 million of road funding and local government grants have been directed to the electorate of Calare, and over that time another $10.6 million has been directed to various natural disaster relief programs in the electorate. It is also worth remembering that the government has in place a $300 million Regional Partnerships program to assist with structural adjustment. The government has also provided for all regional business - I do not mean just in the electorate of Calare - an extra $77.6 million in the budget to respond to those programs. I would have thought, being very candid and direct with the member, that off the top of my head there were differences in the intensity, but I will look at the honourable member's proposal and I will write to him about it. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his interest in unemployment and for the question. As was announced last week by the ABS, Australia now has a 5.5 per cent unemployment rate - the lowest in 23 years. The longterm unemployment rate in April comprised just 1.1 per cent of the entire labour force. This is the lowest level of longterm unemployment ever recorded: just 1.1 per cent of the entire labour force. It is the lowest level ever recorded. Youth unemployment is down from 14.9 per cent to 11.9 per cent. Mature age unemployment has more than halved - from eight per cent under the Labor Party to 3.5 per cent today. The Howard government has created 1.3 million jobs since 1996. More than 630,000 of those jobs have been full-time jobs.Importantly, 68,000 full-time jobs have been created in just the last six months. That compares with some 53,000 full-time jobs during the last six years of the Labor government. There were 53,000 full-time jobs in six years of a Labor government and 68,000 full-time jobs in the last six months of the Howard government. By any measure, employment is up, unemployment is down, mature age unemployment is down, longterm unemployment is down and youth unemployment is down - a very, very good situation for families, individuals and the country. The Job Network and job placement organisations are averaging 42,000 job placements per month and, in the month of May, they contributed a record 50,000 job seekers into the labour market - 50,000 Australians placed into jobs by the Job Network and by the job placement organisations.The real measure is how many people are going into longterm jobs. May was a record for the Job Network. Some 13,700 Australians achieved at least a threemonth period off benefits and in full-time work - the best ever result. That is a proud record of the Job Network and I congratulate them for it.On the back of eight years of economic growth and solid policies, this government, the Howard government, has been able to drive unemployment down. But I am asked whether there are any alternative policies. There are, and they are all of high risk to Australian families, the Australian economy and to Australian business. We have the proposal to abolish youth wages. We have the increase in the cost of casual labour. We have the deputy leader on the other side of the chamber saying that a casual or a part-time job is not worth having. This says a lot about the attitude of the Labor Party. We have a reduction in workplace flexibility, with the removal of AWAs being proposed. We have the return of unions being able to put their noses into businesses where they want and when they want - any time of the day or night. This is not conducive to ensuring that Australians get off welfare and into work.Just have a look at what Labor does in government. Yesterday the Queensland government had more than $2 billion in surplus. It is the only government in this country that does not support its unemployed through transport subsidies. Yesterday it remained steadfast by saying not one cent was to help Queensland's unemployed on the public trains, on the public ferries and on the public buses. This is a disgrace. Look at the New South Wales Labor government. When it gets itself into crisis and has to have a mini budget, what does it do? It removes the mature age program for the unemployed. How heartless can you get? In Queensland, Labor is no help whatsoever for those needing assistance on public transport to get to jobs in the most decentralised state and in New South Wales Labor is abolishing assistance to the mature aged. Look what Labor does. Labor is bad for employment, bad for business and bad for Australia. </DOC>

 - The minister has made, I believe, a very valuable and adequate addition to the answer that he previously gave. I believe that the minister acted in good faith in relying on the information that he had been provided with. I would remind the House that a joint statement was issued by the Chief of the Defence Force and the Secretary of the Department of Defence pointing out that the information on which Senator Hill and I had relied on in good faith -  - had in fact been inaccurately provided. So as far as changes within the department are concerned, Senator Hill and I have had a lengthy discussion and I have asked for, and I know that Senator Hill is instituting, changes inside the department to make it far less likely that inaccurate information, albeit in good faith, will be passed on in future by the defence department to the minister.  I take the opportunity afforded by the Leader of the Opposition's question to simply say again that the statements that I made in this House were based on written material that I had received; they were given in good faith. That material was wrong. Obviously that is a matter of concern to me. There are, I know, changes inside the department that Senator Hill is considering and discussing with Mr Smith and General Cosgrove to reduce the likelihood of something like this occurring in the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macarthur for his question. I know that he is a living, breathing example of how to tackle the problem of obesity. I want to point out to the House that there are a number of projects within my department to tackle the problem of obesity, particularly obesity in childhood: a $4.3 million Active Script program for doctors to write lifestyle prescriptions to encourage people to exercise rather than simply take pharmaceutical drugs; $9.1 million to the National Health and Medical Research Council on obesity related research; and nearly $1 million has been spent by my department over the last few years to promote walk to work and walk to school days because sensible exercise is a very important practical way to tackle obesity. The Prime Minister will soon be making a major statement on this very important topic.It is an important issue, but it is certainly not going to be tackled by stunts masquerading as policy. We know that everything the Leader of the Opposition says is plagiarised from someone: he plagiarised his childhood reading policy from Bill Clinton; he plagiarised his Iraq policy from Dick Morris; and I think he has plagiarised his total ban on food advertising in any time when children might be watching the television from the new film, Super Size Me. But I want to make it clear that parents are much more important than advertisers when it comes to setting a good example to their children. I could not help but notice in the paper on Tuesday that the Leader of the Opposition was at the races with young Oliver and he made himself a sandwich. I am quoting from the Australian newspaper, which said:The Opposition Leader went to the trouble of making it himself, stuffing the lovely greasy chips into his roll.It seems the only book he read to his kids that day was the form guide and he might have come across, in the form guide, a nag called Policy out of Super Size Me by Dr Man-Boobs. - I am sorry, Mr Speaker. I believe it is a comment that has been bandied around by the Leader of the Opposition's press secretary. Let me make it very clear that Sweden has banned so-called junk food advertising on children's television for years and it has made absolutely no difference to the obesity rates. Last year the National Obesity Taskforce reported to the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council on the question of advertising so-called junk food to children, and the Health Ministers Advisory Council decided that there was no case for a ban on advertising.  This is an opposition which is opposing the government's attempt to restrict Internet porn and it will not let Ronald McDonald onto primetime television. Not only that, but it will not even let, under its policy, Woolworths advertise fresh vegetables and fresh meat in primetime television when children might be watching. This is a completely ill thought out, knee-jerk policy. It is populist posturing of the worst sort and what it indicates is precisely why serious people cannot take this opposition seriously at all.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. I know that she represents very ably many naval personnel who live in her electorate, and they appreciate the strong support she gives them. HMAS Stuart has a ship's company of 175 personnel, and they are playing a vital role in coalition operations in the Iraq theatre. HMAS Stuart was deployed in April, primarily to conduct maritime security for Iraqi oil terminals and territorial waters and to prevent the smuggling of oil and illegal cargo. Indeed, the Stuart has had boarding parties on 30 different vessels and has questioned another 278 vessels since it has been in the area of operation. Significantly, HMAS Stuart assisted with the evacuation of injured United States service personnel during a foiled terrorist attack on the Basra oil terminal in April. The Stuart's role, I might remind the House, is anything but symbolic. The Leader of the Opposition says that the presence of our troops in Iraq - half of whom he now wishes to keep there - is nothing but symbolic. There is no doubt about the value of that ship in the operation.The Leader of the Opposition has been telling the Australian people that if he is elected as the Prime Minister of Australia he will have the troops home by Christmas. Of course, now we know - as a result of the events of the last week - that this is not true. Some of those troops will remain in Iraq, but they will be stranded by Christmas because the support of the C130s will have gone. It is now apparent that HMAS Stuart would also be left in the Persian Gulf by the Labor government. Senator Evans, the Labor spokesman on defence, said, `Labor supports the deployment of HMAS Stuart but makes a distinction between the ongoing war against terrorism and the postwar environment in Iraq.' So this is another shambles of a policy. The Labor Party says that the HMAS Stuart will remain in the Persian Gulf and that it will help with the war against terrorism - but only if the terrorists are not targeting Iraqi targets. Just imagine how utterly foolish that policy is. If terrorists are targeting Kuwaiti targets, or Iranian targets, or targets in Dubai or the United Arab Emirates, then HMAS Stuart can be used; but if the terrorists go to Um Qasr or Basra, then HMAS Stuart cannot be used! This again illustrates the simple absurdity of the Labor Party's muddle-headed `troops home by Christmas' policy. The Leader of the Opposition owes it to the parliament and to the country to make a statement explaining precisely what his policy really is, because at the moment it is a policy where he is telling the public one thing - troops home by Christmas - and his spokesmen are going around telling another story. When this is raised with the Leader of the Opposition's office, they say, `We've been saying all these troops will remain, and we've been saying that since March.' Yet, if you go through the Leader of the Opposition's statements, and if you go through the transcripts of what he said, there is no sign of him saying he would keep any troops there after Christmas. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition has been grossly misleading, and the Leader of the Opposition is way out of his depth on this important security issue.</DOC>

 - Here we have again from the opposition an attempt to smear the government, to smear officials who work for the government and to smear personnel from the Australian Defence Force. Let us understand what the proposition being put forward by the Latham led opposition is. The proposition being put forward by the Latham led opposition is that somehow the government knew about the Abu Ghraib abuses that we have all seen in photographs. What is more, so egregious is the smear that the claim is there was a cover-up. This is a disgraceful smear. The government knew nothing about the Abu Ghraib abuses. In earlier times after the fall of Baghdad the Americans did not even use the Abu Ghraib prison; it was only used in later times. The opposition spokesman always leaves himself exposed, because he talks so much. - The Labor Party - and I accept they have a few fellow travellers - have been trying to associate this government with the Abu Ghraib abuses. And what is the latest smear coming from the member for Griffith? That Amnesty International produced a report, amongst thousands of reports produced, and, ergo, the government knew about the Abu Ghraib abuses and covered them up. That is a disgraceful smear. The opposition have been smearing the Australian Defence Force, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Prime Minister and Senator Hill. The fact is that everybody in Australia knows that this government was not aware of the Abu Ghraib abuses that we have all seen in the photographs. I make one final point: the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs visited Iraq in November last year. Did the opposition spokesman know about abuses in Iraqi prisons? Did he ask anybody about abuses in Iraqi prisons while he was there? Did he make any submissions on human rights in Iraq? On 16 January the American military publicly acknowledged there had been abuses and announced that they were investigating these abuses and dealing with them. From 16 January until after the Abu Ghraib photographs were released, we heard not one word from the opposition. In other words, all this is is a concocted smear, designed to associate the government with the Abu Ghraib abuses. And that, if I may say so to the Leader of the Opposition, is a lie.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. He is from Victoria, of course, and is very much aware of the problems that have been faced in that state and wants to see those issues effectively addressed. Yesterday I advised the House of the government's plan to establish an independent national anticorruption body and to give it the capacity to deal quickly and effectively with allegations of corruption where they may arise at any time in the future. I indicated that this was a proactive and pre-emptive step on the part of the Commonwealth, and I am pleased at the support that the measure has received. I saw a statement by the member for Barton, the Law Council of Australia and the Australian Federal Police Association, amongst others.In Victoria, where clear evidence exists of systemic corruption within the police service, we have a ridiculous situation where the Bracks Labor government seeks to blame everybody but itself for what has happened in that state. I was particularly interested in the words of the former royal commissioner and Federal Court judge Sir Edward Woodward, reported in the Age on 7 June. He said:The Victorian Government failed to act for a long time and has now instituted a flurry of actions that can be fairly described as a complete dog's breakfast, with the recipe changing daily.I do not think you can say it more effectively than that. The Victorian government continues to resist establishing a properly constructed, independent anticorruption body. This is despite the advice that Victoria has had from the Commonwealth that we would ensure that such a body had effective telephone interception powers which, it is believed, are an important resource for being able to investigate criminal activity of this sort. Instead of seeing that as a constructive comment, the acting Victorian Premier yesterday sought to denigrate me for the action I have taken, which has been clearly seen by most dispassionate observers as being a proper and legally sound position. If the acting Premier will not take my word, he ought to at least take the word of the honourable member for Barton. Yesterday, in relation to his support of a Commonwealth initiative, the Member for Barton said: The Commonwealth Ombudsman has a very specific role in the review of conduct complaints against AFP and ACC officers, as well as the review of the issuing of interception warrants by Commonwealth law enforcement agencies.On the ABC, speaking of the Commonwealth Ombudsman, he went on to say:To effectively do this anti-corruption role, I think the body will need those sort of law enforcement powers and it's inconsistent, I believe, for the body at the one and the same time to have an overview function, as well as an enforcement function.So it is fine for the Commonwealth but it is not fine for Victoria! What we saw was the Victorians arguing that they could take interception powers, without asking, because a statement was issued to that effect before any correspondence with the Commonwealth. They went on after that to accuse me of being soft in relation to crime because we would not give the power to the Ombudsman. But in the Commonwealth sphere, the opposition would assert that that was not an appropriate body to have such a power. I do not know what the member for Barton was doing yesterday. He had two press releases, which was a bit unusual. What he asked me to do in relation to Victoria -  - I do not know that it got a run but I certainly saw it. But what he asked me to do was to sit down and negotiate the granting of these powers to state authorities. I do not know whether he is saying I should sit down and negotiate to give power to the Ombudsman that he would not give federally, or whether he is saying that in relation to the people who saw fit to issue a press release and not seek to negotiate with me I ought to be silent. I will not be silent in relation to those matters. There is a proper basis for dealing with these issues, and the opposition ought to get on side and tell their Victorian colleagues they should fix it up by establishing a proper body for that task.</DOC>

 - The proposition being put by the opposition here - Opposition members - Answer the question! - The proposition being put by the opposition here is that because Amnesty produced a report in July 2003 the government is culpable in the Abu Ghraib abuses. That is an absolutely disgraceful smear, and it is utterly untrue. Amnesty International did not reveal the sorts of abuses we saw in the Abu Ghraib photographs. Those types of abuses were not revealed to us, to the American government or to the British government or senior officials until April of this year, to the best of my knowledge. The opposition leader put out a statement which said:Unfortunately the prisoner atrocity scandal has given the terrorists a significant win - the best recruitment campaign they could have hoped for ... If the opposition leader believes that, why is he trying to associate our country and our government with the Abu Ghraib abuses? - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. Not in this year's budget but in last year's budget the government announced measures to reform Australia's international taxation arrangements. This was designed to encourage Australian companies to set up regional headquarters here, to improve Australia's attractiveness as a base for our own multinational companies and to make it possible for increased business and increased jobs here in Australia. Those measures passed the House of Representatives yesterday, and they passed with Labor support.I was a bit surprised, really, to read in today's Financial Review that the member for Kingston, who actually came and supported these measures and helped them wing their way through the House of Representatives, said that these were good measures but `a bare minimum'. He said that Labor wanted a debate on more fundamental reform, including dividend streaming and a tax credit for foreign dividends. The member for Kingston says that it is good as far as it goes but it should go further - we should have cut more tax on the international arrangements. Behind his mild mannered exterior he would have you believe he is a veritable superman of fiscal restraint. `It's not a bird, it's not a plane; it's Superman, the member for Kingston!'Why was I so surprised by all of this veritable superman fiscal restraint that was being talked about down here in the House of Representatives yesterday? It is for this reason: when I announced the measure back in the 2003-04 budget the Labor Party said it opposed the measure. I will read to you what the member for Hotham, the then Leader of the Opposition, said:In the budget just two days ago the Treasurer announced a further $300 million in tax cuts for multinational businesses. Now you know where the cuts to your family's health services are going! So, to help pay for Labor's new deal to save Medicare, I will redirect some of the government's business tax changes ...When that speech was tabled it was tabled with a financial chart that showed that Labor would not pass these measures, that Labor would oppose this tax cut and that Labor would spend $270 million, saved from opposing this tax cut, on its Medicare policy.The most extraordinary thing is that the member for Kingston believes that we should cut taxes and do more; the member for Lalor, the shadow minister for health, says that we should not have passed those tax cuts and the money should be spent on Medicare; the member for Fraser says that the money should be put into an intergenerational fund; and the member for Hotham said it should be left over for a bigger surplus at the end of the day. So tax less, spend more, invest it away for the future and have it left at the end of the day - and it is the same $270 million! It is the most amazing piece of creative accounting that I have ever seen in my life. I know of only one authority for Labor economics - Norman Lindsay, in his book The Magic Pudding: `cut and come again'. Spend it on tax cuts, spend it on Medicare, invest it for the future and have it left over at the end of the day. Walk the right-hand side of the street, walk the left-hand side of the street, walk down no street and, if you are the member for Hotham, hide five blocks away and do not engage in the argument at all. The whole of Australia breathlessly waits to know how this all adds up. How this can be done? How can you cut tax, spend more, invest the remainder and have it left over at the end of the day?We were promised that we were going to have all of the Australian Labor Party's costings. You have heard of D-Day - 6 June? Well, noon today was D-Day for all of the policies of the Australian Labor Party. They now sit tick, tick, ticking in the Leader of the Opposition's filing cabinet. Inside that filing cabinet is no policy; there is just a magic pudding with a whole lot of things that do not add up. And the people of Australia are going to find you out.</DOC>

 - As I have indicated on a number of occasions, I will be making a statement on this issue later this month. But, seeing that the Leader of the Opposition has invited me to compare the coalition's approach to this issue with the approach adopted by the Australian Labor Party, I do so with some enthusiasm. I have to say that his proposal to impose an arbitrary, draconian and sweeping ban on advertising in not only child-specific television programs but also general television programs where predominantly the audience is likely to be children is one of the more ham-fisted, ill-conceived policies that any leader of a political party has produced in recent months. It bears all the hallmarks of something dreamt up for the 6 p.m. news bulletin without any sort of design and without any regard for the fundamentals of life. The fundamentals of life are that, more than anybody else, the parents of children are their guardians, their guides and the people who shape their character and attitudes.I reflect to myself on how far this man has wandered from the rhetoric of his early days as opposition leader - when I thought mum and dad were king; when I thought the whole foundation of a healthy life for a child, not only physically but also mentally and spiritually, lay in the guidance, love and nurturing that those children would receive in the home. Of course the government has a responsibility in relation to obesity programs, the community has a responsibility, the doctors have a responsibility and commercial interests have a responsibility. But, at the end of the day, if we are going to build a really healthy society where families are the dominant influence in shaping the young, we do not take responsibility away from mothers and fathers; we back their responsibility. We do not say to them, `Don't you worry; the government will take over your monitoring role and your role to set an example.' What the Leader of the Opposition is propounding is a charter for a retreat by parents from their responsibilities in relation to their children. It is a stupid, ill-conceived ban; it has been widely condemned throughout the Australian community; and it demonstrates inexperience and, may I say so, an unfitness for office.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. The business of politics is about explaining to people what you can achieve, how you will pay for it and what choices you have made, and giving them the opportunity to cast a vote accordingly. But the business of politics is not about promising the same money in tax cuts as you are promising to spend, invest for the future and have left over at the end of the day. I am aware that it is now claimed, in some circles, that Commonwealth expenditure can be reduced by $8 billion. This claim is made by the member for Werriwa, who is now studiously engaging in conversation and pretending that he is not interested in what he has previously said. - The reason that I am aware of this is that Media Monitors, which is a monitoring organisation - and I ask the House to listen to this carefully - recorded an interview that the Leader of the Opposition gave to Alan Jones on 14 May 2004. In the course of this interview the Leader of the Opposition said:... we've identified $8 billion in government savings.I will read the transcript:Alan Jones: But is there a document that identifies that?Mark Latham: Yes, there is. Yes.Alan Jones: That the public can look at?Mark Latham: Yes. I've got that here in front of me.There is a document that the public can look at. In fact, the document was in front of the member for Werriwa on 14 May. I think there are 78 `members of the public' over here who would be interested in looking at that, and I am sure there are about 50 `members of the public' up above us who would be interested in looking at the document. I think there would be many people in the gallery who would like to look at this document on the $8 billion worth of savings, and there are probably millions of Australians who would like to know how you can cut Commonwealth expenditures by $8 billion. Again:Alan Jones: But is there a document that identifies that?Mark Latham: Yes, there is. Yes.Alan Jones: That the public can look at?Mark Latham: Yes. I've got that right here in front of me.Being a person who was interested in looking at that document, I went to the ALP web site. The ALP web site has a transcript of a radio interview with Alan Jones on 14 May 2004. At this point, I ask members of the backbench to log into the site, in case of changes. Anyway, this is how the transcript reads on the ALP web site:Mark Latham: ... we've identified over $8 billion in government savings.Alan Jones: But is there a document that identifies that?Mark Latham: Yes. I've got that right here in front of me. The question `That the public can look at?' and the answer, `Yes,' have been mysteriously omitted from the transcript. I am going to tender these documents from Media Monitors which record that on 14 May there was a document that the public could look at. But strangely there is now no document that the public is allowed to look at. What is more, there is no question and there is no answer. How often have I said to beware of the ALP web site and to get the original text before it gets airbrushed out of existence? I am going to table that as well. It is a pretty simple proposition, isn't it? If Commonwealth expenditures can be cut by $8 billion and there is a list of how it can be done, why can't the public look at it? The public have been told that all of these promises can be funded from these savings, so why can't the public look at it?In addition, I will make another point. It is not just the savings that have to be paid for with this nonexistent $8 billion, on a list which does not exist in a transcript which has been airbrushed; we also have to find a tax policy out of this. And we know - don't we? - that it is going to be a wide and broad tax policy, with tax cuts for everybody - and not small amounts. It is going to have tax cuts because the Leader of the Opposition promised that also in the budget week. I do not know whether I put onto the record yesterday the transcript from the Jon Faine program - the transcript of 28 April 2004, when we were going to find out in budget week the thresholds and amounts of the ALP tax policy - but I do have it and I would like to put that down as well.What is happening here is this: the Labor Party has made a whole lot of promises that it cannot keep, the Labor Party has no ability whatsoever to fund the promises that it already has on the record and the Labor Party is now running scared. The Leader of the Opposition counts down every single day until the ending of a parliamentary week and says to himself, `If I have distracted the press on some issue, that is one more day that I have escaped scrutiny.' The stuff of politics is about scrutiny and it is about policy. It is about making choices and it is about coming clean with the Australian people. The Australian people will not be taking this opposition leader seriously until such time as he can put down a policy, show that he has some substance and put himself out for scrutiny by the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question and for his very strong support for apprentices in particular. When Paul Keating was Prime Minister of Australia, he really created a culture in which young people were told that if they did not go to university they were not as good as somebody else who did, and that is something that has been carried on very strongly by the Australian Labor Party, reflected by the amount of attention - or lack of attention - given in this House by the other side to apprenticeships and training. There are now 407,000 Australians who are doing apprenticeships, a 10 per cent increase on last year; and 1.3 million Australians who are in TAFEs throughout the length and breadth of Australia.It is interesting that across Australia last year we had increases in TAFE fees. TAFE fees are set by state and territory governments. In the state of New South Wales, for example, TAFE fees increased on average by 95 per cent in last year's state budget, but they increased by up to 300 per cent across New South Wales. In Victoria, the Victorian government increased TAFE fees by 25 per cent. In South Australia, TAFE fees for apprentices increased by 50 per cent. Unlike university students, who have access to HECS, where they do not pay their bit back until they are working and can pay it back through the tax system, students who go to TAFE have to pay their fees up front, and they often have to pull out the family credit card to do so. In fact, a quarter of the people who go to TAFE in Australia come from the poorest socioeconomic status suburbs in the country.I asked my department to do some analysis and engage some work to find out what might be the impact of these substantial - in some cases, way over the top - TAFE fee increases across Australia. My department engaged a firm called Access Economics - which would be very well known to the Leader of the Opposition - to do some work upon the impact of these TAFE fee increases on the demand for TAFE across Australia. In fact, Access Economics has found that over the next three years 100,000 Australians, most of them young Australians, will not be going to TAFE, as a direct result of these fee increases across Australia. It is absolutely shameful. In the state of New South Wales alone this year - that is 2004 - there are some 24,000 people who will not go to TAFE, and 6,500 in Victoria.I take the House back to 24 July 2003. Speaking on 2UE's Steve Price program, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Jagajaga, received a call from a bloke called Andrew. He said: `I've just got a concern. I'm currently enrolled at a TAFE in Western Sydney. Our fees at the moment are $710 a year. I'm doing an advanced diploma and we've been told yesterday those fees will go up to $1,200 next year. I'm pretty concerned and our teachers are very concerned.'The Deputy Leader of the Opposition's reply was this. She said: `I agree with you, Andrew. It is really important that we don't get those fees at TAFE making people avoid going to TAFE. I couldn't agree with you more.' I could not agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition more. Access Economics cannot agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition more. The fact is that I and the Prime Minister have repeatedly called on the Australian Labor Party and the Leader of the Opposition to do something - to get off his backside and speak to the premiers across Australia about doing something about the magnitude of these fee increases. In order to help the Leader of the Opposition, I have drafted a joint letter from me as Australia's Minister for Education, Science and Training and from the Leader of the Opposition. We will send this letter to premiers across Australia. It concludes by saying:This information requires a considered and urgent response. We call on you to urgently reverse the magnitude of these fee increases.I will sign this letter and table it. Over the weekend, as I table this letter and table the report, the Leader of the Opposition can reflect on the impact this is having on families across Australia. He needs to reflect on the fact that at the South-West Institute of TAFE students in Western Sydney are paying 200 per cent more to do electrical engineering. If they want to go to Blacktown, they are paying 200 per cent more to do brake repairs and 300 per cent more to do tourism. These are poor families using family credit cards, going into debt to pay their TAFE fees. We now know that 100,000 of them will not be going to TAFE at all. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to sign the letter now. If he cannot do that, I will be back next week to dish out some more.</DOC>

As he is into bipartisanship, perhaps he would like to sign the letter. -  - The Leader of the Opposition has asked me three questions about obesity.

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question and recognise that she has been involved in small business. Together with the member for Indi, I have visited many small businesses in her electorate, and they all seem pretty pleased with their representation in this place. This government has undertaken many initiatives to boost the welfare of small business in regional Australia, including, through AusLink, a $12 billion program that will deliver better roads in regional Australia and through the major energy initiative - the energy white paper announced earlier this week - many businesses in regional Australia will have cheaper fuel. When it comes to red tape, as a result of an over $300 million initiative in the federal budget, 750,000 ABN holders will have only one BAS and one GST payment once a year, compared with Labor's four BASs and four GST payments every year. We are constantly looking for ways to try to reduce the red tape burden on small business. It is therefore unfortunate that the Labor Party has a different view. As we know, the Labor Party has a view that all small businesses have to have four BASs a year. The Labor Party has a view that all small businesses - and businesses generally and farms - have to fill out diesel fuel rebate forms, and we are abolishing those.In Victoria the state government has introduced the Child Employment Bill. Some of its intentions are worthy - I think everyone would agree with that - but there are some so-called unintended consequences which clearly illustrate that the Labor Party does not understand either families or family businesses. For example, under this new law, grandparents must get a permit before their grandchildren are allowed to work on the family farm, to work in a family shop or even to help out with grandma's weeding in the garden. Under the Labor Party's law in Victoria grandma now has to get a permit to have a grandchild work around the house.It goes further. Aunts and uncles running a family farm have to get a police check and a permit before they offer a job to a niece or a nephew. You might ask, `What is the impact of that? What happens if someone is looking for a helping hand in a sudden situation?' In the course of a drought, if a next-door neighbour is looking for a helping hand, they have to have a police check and a permit before they can offer any form of paid employment to a younger person. So do not ask your kids to go and collect the eggs from the chook shed or help out feeding the cattle, because under this arrangement any voluntary work by anyone under the age of 13 around the house is not permitted.This is red tape gone wrong. What it clearly illustrates is that the Labor Party believes that families have no sense of regulation about their own services and that the government has to regulate all family activities. If you ask your kids to go out and collect the newspapers or to bring in the garbage and you give them a couple of bucks for it, you are meant to supervise them, or you cannot engage them in that work with a police permit. Can you believe that you have to do that under those sorts of circumstances? Do you know what the fines are? Ten thousand dollars. The Labor Party in Victoria is employing child protection officers who have a right of entry to inspect a workplace and the right to require the production of documents. This is more red tape. It is the nanny state coming to the fore. The Labor Party believes that more regulation is necessary to regulate families.Let us make it clear how significant the impact is on regional Victoria. I picked up an article in the Bendigo Advertiser - I am sure the member for Bendigo reads her local newspaper -  - by Paul Weller, the President of the Victorian Farmers Federation. He says:The Child Employment Bill will mean that kids can no longer help their grandfather change plough points, they can't help their older cousins drove stock and they cannot even help their nanna feed the working dogs.	...	...	...Further, the VFF believes farm families should not have to go through the rigours of obtaining a child employment permit, a compulsory police check as well as waiting for the government department to send the form back within a reasonable timeframe, simply to allow a niece, nephew or grandchild to do routine chores on the farm. He goes on to say:There comes a time when country people have to stand up and say enough is enough to government interference. This bill is one example where the VFF believes country Victorians need to do just that.Amen to that.</DOC>

 - I welcome the question from the member for Hotham. Can I say what a pleasure it is to have him on his feet at the dispatch box. In relation to all of the government announcements, the government actually announces forward estimates tables. As I recall, the announcements all show how all of these things are funded. For example, in relation to the energy statement, most of the changes take place from 2008. -  - They are fully funded in the year on which they are put forward - 2008. The tables are there, and they are fully funded from 2008. The reason why he apparently has such great nerve, of course, is that that is outside the four-year forward estimates of the budget. So they are fully factored in. In relation to pneumococcal, as I recall it - and I will just check with the Minister for Health and Ageing - I think the pneumococcal announcement was $186 million -  -  - It is $178 million - I stand corrected, and the member for Hotham stands corrected by his own backbench. It is $178 million, the backbench said. - In relation to the AusLink funding, it is all factored into the budget - it was announced on budget night. What the government did was to announce the projects that were funded through the AusLink funding, which have already been fully factored into the forward estimates. - Can I say in relation to AusLink that, if the Australian Labor Party's position is that they oppose the AusLink projects, we would be interested for them to say so. Normally at this point the member for Hotham interjects if he has something to say. - This is the only occasion on which he has not interjected. He can name those AusLink programs that he actually opposes, because, as I understand it, the Labor Party not only say they accept the AusLink programs but that they believe they should be upped in expenditure. That is certainly the announcement that the member for Batman made. So we have fully funded it in the forward estimates, but the only area where there has been criticism from the Australian Labor Party is that area of AusLink which they do not say should receive less money but, in fact, more money. There is one way you can reconcile Labor's complaint about AusLink with Labor's complaint about expenditures, and that is if they do have a secret plan not to fund one of those AusLink projects. I have monitored them very carefully - I actually monitor their original transcripts and their airbrushed transcripts. There is one AusLink program which the Australian Labor Party have never said a word about. It is the freeway which dare not speak its name in the House - or it is a tollway whose name can be spoken but a freeway whose name cannot be spoken. If the Australian Labor Party are to reconcile their demands for more spending on specific roads with their complaint that road funding is too high, they could do it by announcing their position in relation to the Scoresby Freeway. But, on this side of the House, as I said yesterday, we believe in the people of the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Labor let them down: state Labor lied to them and federal Labor threaten to do the same thing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question. He is a great representative of those eastern suburbs in Melbourne that the Treasurer was referring to previously.In answer to the member for Aston's question, I can reveal to the House that Australian workplace agreements - that is, agreements made individually between employers and employees - are the fastest growing employment instrument in the country. Nearly 16,000 Australian workplace agreements were approved in May, which smashed the previous monthly record by nearly 2,000. This takes to almost half a million the total number of Australian workplace agreements that have been approved since 1997. Indeed, AWAs now cover 16 per cent of all employees who are covered by federal agreements.Not only do we have increasing numbers, month by month, of Australian workers who are moving onto Australian workplace agreements, but on average they are also being paid more under these agreements. Indeed, employees in Australia covered by Australian workplace agreements are earning on average 29 per cent more than their colleagues covered by federal certified agreements. If you break those figures down and, for example, look at women who are employed under AWAs then we find that something like 32 per cent on average are paid more than their colleagues who are covered by federal certified agreements. - The member for Aston asked me whether there were any alternative approaches to Australian workplace agreements. There is one quite distinct alternative approach, from the Latham Labor Party, which is to abolish Australian workplace agreements and the Office of the Employment Advocate, which protects workers in this regard. One must ask why the ALP would want to abolish these employment instruments which, as I said, grew by almost 16,000 in the month of May and are the fastest growing employment instrument in Australia. The simple reason is $40 million. Forty million dollars is the amount of money that the Australian unions have donated to the Australian Labor Party over the last seven years. We have a conflict of interest here with the union arm of the Australian Labor Party who, in return for their $40 million worth of donations to the Australian Labor Party, are demanding that Australian workplace agreements be abolished. They are demanding that the ability of employers and employees in Australia to enter into an agreement of choice be abolished and taken out of the statutes and the codes so far as Australia is concerned.There can be only one reason for this, and that is a pure ideological hatred of Australian workplace agreements and the fact that employers and employees in this country, in numbers increasing by thousands each month, can enter into agreements where there is one party that is excluded from those agreements. The one party excluded from individual workplace agreements is the unions. In return for their $40 million of donations from the big unions the Australian Labor Party are saying that this ability of employers and employees to actually choose the sort of employment agreement that they want is something which they will not allow.What the Leader of the Opposition wants is a return to a regressive system - a one-size-fits-all system - where you give the Australian Industrial Relations Commission increased powers to arbitrate, where you extend the number of matters under awards; you drive jobs down and investment in Australian businesses out, because you have this regressive system which the Australian Labor Party is planning to put in place. The Latham Labor Party ought to wake up to how regressive this is for jobs and for investment in Australia. I call upon the Leader of the Opposition to scrap this crazy plan to abolish Australian workplace agreements. If he is not prepared to do that, it is further proof that he is not to be trusted with the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - In terms of the restructure of Mitsubishi in Australia and globally, we all know that Mitsubishi's problems were brought about by an international and global problem, not a problem here in Australia. However, the Australian manufacturing sector of Mitsubishi was affected by the restructuring.As the member for Kingston knows, this government put in place a $50 million plan to ensure the workers of Mitsubishi were not only given assistance if they were retrenched but also provided with an opportunity to get new jobs through investment by new industries in South Australia. I can report that that investment fund is well on its way to being established. We are currently finalising the guidelines in complete cooperation with the Labor government of South Australia, and I am confident that that investment plan will give an opportunity to any workers replaced by Mitsubishi to have a chance of getting jobs under industries attracted to South Australia. I am asked have I had recent contact with Mitsubishi in Japan - in the last two days, no. Was I made aware by Mitsubishi that there were to be retrenchments in Australia? Yes, I was. When I visited Japan with Kevin Foley, there was an estimate provided by Mitsubishi at that time. We put in place a plan which we are confident will cover any additional, but minor, retrenchments caused by the latest announcement by Mitsubishi.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson for his question and for reminding the House about the $36 million smash-and-grab raid on the Australian taxpayer mounted by the Australian Labor Party, which makes the Great Train Robbery look like a mere act of shoplifting. Every day the rent rort goes on, the fleece metre just ticks over: $6,721 a day trousered by the Leader of the Opposition for his marginal seat campaign. The $50,000 which the Labor Party has spent in Paterson this week has been ripped off by the Australian Labor Party, and it comes directly from Centenary House.Thanks to the rent rort - this disgraceful rent rort, this disgraceful abuse of the processes of government - taxpayers pay more for a nondescript office in Barton than they would pay for the best office space anywhere in the world. To give you some idea of the extent of the rip-off, I checked out the Internet for the Eternal City of Rome - beloved of Gough Whitlam and other great mentors of the Leader of the Opposition. Would you believe that prime office space in the heart of Rome costs just $847 a square metre, which is $24 less than the $871 a square metre which the Labor Party rips off from the Australian taxpayer for Centenary House in Barton?I like exploring, so I went further on the Internet. I found that you can actually rent out the home of none other than Niccolo Machiavelli himself. Forget Dick Morris - there is a castle in the Chianti hills in Tuscany where you can live and breathe the real deal. Machiavelli's castle has central heating, jacuzzi, housekeeping services, wine-tasting and cooking classes all laid on. You can rent Machiavelli's castle for just $866 a square metre. So what have you got? You have the low-rent Machiavellis living in Machiavelli's real castle, and you have the high-rent Machiavellis of the ALP living in Centenary House, Barton. You have to hand it to the Leader of the Opposition - you really have to hand it to him. He has come a long way. He has come a long way from Green Valley. Now he is in the Chianti hills of Tuscany.It is interesting that just this week who should announce that he is leaving the parliament but Senator Nick Bolkus, the former Minister for Administrative Services, who presided over the rent rort rip-off in the first place. The Australian people have a very clear message and the people of Green Valley have a very clear message for the Leader of the Opposition: send the rent rort packing with Nick Bolkus. When the author of the lease fleece goes, end the lease fleece itself. The Leader of the Opposition can run around striking all the poses that he wants, he can run around calling for all the spurious bipartisanship in the world but, just for once, the Leader of the Opposition should do something real. He should be authentic just for once and end the rent rort now. </DOC>

 - I might start my response to this question by pointing out to the Leader of the Opposition that the most proactive thing that any government has done about rural services in this country in the last 20 years has been the inauguration of the rural transaction centres program. These are centres which provide basic services in rural areas where the critical mass has made it difficult, on commercial grounds, for banks and other financial institutions to maintain services. There are currently 114 rural transaction centres operating in Australia and a further 126 have been approved.I might point out to the Leader of the Opposition that this is doing something positive with well-directed government resources to maintain basic services in country areas. It is a proposal that was first conceived back in 1997 - seven years ago. In fact, I think I opened the first one. I remember that not long after the last election I paid a very memorable visit to Ganmain in the electorate of the member for Riverina, in which we opened a rural transaction centre. The giroPost initiative is offered at almost 3,000 Australia Post outlets across Australia. I will respond to the Leader of the Opposition in relation to the requirement on the banks, but perhaps I should ask the Leader of the Opposition, rhetorically, of course: will he join me in applauding the rural transaction centres initiative as a great coalition initiative to do something about this problem?The Labor Party have released a policy on banking. In my view, that policy will impose additional costs on banks, and those costs will be passed on to customers through higher fees and charges or increased interest rates. The $30 million community fund is nothing more than another tax on the banks. The Labor Party's proposal will impose an additional layer of red tape. I point out to the Leader of the Opposition that it is not necessary to legislate for mandatory safety net accounts, as banks already provide no frills accounts to low-income earners, including pensioners. I say to the Leader of the Opposition again: banks already provide no frills accounts to low-income earners, including pensioners. While we are talking about bank fees, I also remind the Leader of the Opposition of a bank fee which he opposed the abolition of - that is, the financial institutions duty. The financial institutions duty, which used to collect $1.4 billion from banking customers, was part of taxation reform. Guess who opposed that? Guess who airbrushed that out? That did not get a reference in front of Country Labor yesterday. No, there was no talk of financial institutions duty when the Leader of the Opposition addressed Country Labor yesterday. If the Leader of the Opposition had had his way, bank customers would be paying an additional $1.4 billion. I remind him of the way interest rates have fallen under this government. I remind him of the financial literacy initiatives of the Consumer and Financial Literacy Taskforce, chaired by Mr Paul Clitheroe in February this year. In other words, I do not think the Leader of the Opposition's initiatives will benefit consumers. They tread a path that has been well trodden before by others. They will add complexity and red tape, and of course they fail to acknowledge that, if the Labor Party had had their way, we would still have the financial institutions duty that would be ripping $1.4 billion out of bank customers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson, who, along with so many members on this side of the House - and I detect, from this morning's press, along with a growing number of people on the other side of the House - sees the virtue of Australia joining in ratifying, as appropriate, through individual pieces of legislation, the free trade agreement negotiated by the Minister for Trade with the United States several months ago. As I have indicated to the House before, the signs that I received from both sides of Congress when I was in Washington were very encouraging. There is a real prospect that, within a few weeks, the American Congress could vote in favour of the US-Australia free trade agreement. But it is not only both sides of politics in the United States that need to be in favour of this measure if it is to become law; it needs to be a meeting of minds of both sides of politics in Australia as well.So far, the Leader of the Opposition has been unwilling to declare himself. The Leader of the Opposition has had at least four or five months to examine this, and he still cannot make up his mind, unlike of course the eight Labor state and territory leaders. Of the pieces of correspondence that I had in front of me over the weekend, I had letters to the six premiers and the two chief ministers of Australia. I was writing back to them and thanking them for expressing the willingness of their state governments to participate in the government procurement market section of the Australia-US free trade agreement. At a federal government level, access to the United States federal government procurement market opens up a potential market of $US200 billion. I can now inform the House that 27 states of the United States have also indicated that, at a state level, they will join the procurement market. Those states include California, whose procurement market alone is worth $42.7 billion; New York, where the market is worth $37.6 billion; and Texas, where it is worth $24.6 billion. It is estimated that the state government procurement market is worth another $200 billion on top of the federal government procurement market.One of the conditions of the free trade agreement is that we can have access to this enormous government procurement market. It is little wonder, therefore, that, for example, the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Carr, said: It is in Australia's interest to link ourselves with the world's most dynamic and creative economy.Also, the Premier of South Australia said, `An FTA would give us access to 280 million customers.' The Premier of Victoria said, `I recognise the potential benefits for the Victorian economy through increased access to markets and improved investment flows.' And never one for understatement, the Premier of Queensland said, `An FTA could be the most momentous boost for our primary industries in 100 years.' They are not my words; they are not the words of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer or the Minister for Trade. They are the words of the Labor premiers of Australia.I think that people living all around this country will say that, if the Prime Minister can make up his mind, the Deputy Prime Minister can make his mind, the premiers of all of the states can make up their minds and the chief ministers of the territories can make up their minds, why can't the Leader of the Opposition make up his mind? Why can't the Leader of the Opposition get off the fence and take a stand? Why can't he make a decision to support something that is overwhelmingly in the long-term interests of this country? If we reject this free trade agreement, we will be seen as a laughing stock in the Asia-Pacific region.Apparently, the Labor Party fall over themselves to support a free trade agreement with Singapore and Thailand - and we welcome that, of course - so why won't they give their support to the United States free trade agreement? The Labor Party will have further opportunities to declare themselves over the days and weeks ahead. If they listen to the advice of Labor leaders around Australia who have responsibilities in government as distinct from the opportunism of opposition, they will put the national interest ahead of the political interest and they will back the free trade agreement with United States.</DOC>

 - It is very interesting that I should get a question on heightened competition from the Leader of the Opposition, who has spent a great deal of time denigrating the competition policies that have been followed by this government. Can I remind the Leader of the Opposition that one of the reasons why we have -  - Let us get the historical sequence right. The member for Werriwa belongs to the Australian Labor Party that presided over the highest interest rates this country has had since the end of World War II. It presided over housing interest rates of 17 per cent. It presided over bill rates for farmers that went as high as 23 per cent. It presided over interest rates for small business that went to 21 per cent. Those interest rates have come down under this government. One of the reasons they have come down is that we have fostered greater competition between the banks and the financial institutions. We have increased the role in the activity as a result of the recommendations of the Wallis committee, which was set up immediately after we won government. We have seen the entry into the housing finance area of organisations such as Wizard and Aussie. Those intermediaries have played a major role in the lowering of interest rates. In those circumstances, the Leader of the Opposition, as so often with these things, brings very little credit and very little past performance to questions relating to competition between the banks. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for that very interesting question. I always warm to the subject of Commonwealth-state financial relations when I can feel a premiers conference coming on. At the beginning of a week in which I am pleased as always to have the premiers for dinner, it is always a good idea to have something to say about Commonwealth-state financial relations.This year's Budget Paper No. 3, entitled Federal financial relations, contains some very interesting information. I want the House to listen to this very interesting information. It reveals that, over the five-year period from 2003-04 to 2007-08, the states and territories will receive a grand total of $183.9 billion in GST revenue. It also indicates that, over that period, the states and territories will be $8.9 billion better off than they would have been if the Keating government's Commonwealth-state financial arrangement formula had continued.Let me just tell you how much better off each individual state will be: New South Wales, $1.14 billion; Victoria, $1.43 billion; Queensland - listen to this - $3.18 billion; Western Australia, $1.16 billion; South Australia, $750 million; Tasmania, $449 million; the ACT, would you believe, $249 million; and the Northern Territory, $574 million, with a population of 160,000 or so. What these figures represent is the latest piece of evidence of the extraordinary generosity and effectiveness of the new revenue-sharing arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states.The interesting thing is that, when the intergovernmental agreement was signed in June 1999, it was expected that the benefits from the new arrangements would take much longer to flow through. Originally, it was anticipated that New South Wales and Victoria would get ahead only from 2007-08 and South Australia and Tasmania from 2006-07. But such has been the effectiveness of the new tax system that that is no longer the case. They have effectively come onto the benefits at a much earlier point in time. In fact, we know that all states and territories have been in a net gain position from 2003-04, with the exception of New South Wales, which attains a net gain from the GST in 2004-05. I emphasise these figures for what they illustrate - that is, for the first time since World War II, a federal government has given the states access to a growth tax. The alibi that many of those states have had in the past - that, if only they had more money from the Commonwealth, they could do their job - is no longer there.I know that in Canberra today there are a number of people representing and concerned about, as they properly should be, the interests of government schools around Australia. I will take the opportunity of pointing out to the parliament that every time a state government in this country spends $1 on a government school, 44c in that dollar has come from the GST or Commonwealth government grants. I will say that again: every time a state government around Australia spends $1 on a government school, 44c in that dollar has come directly from the GST or Commonwealth government specific purpose payments. So when you add that to the direct funding of government schools by the federal government, the reality is that federal governments provide more money for the funding of government schools than, indeed, do the state governments from their own revenue sources. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lalor for her question. Let me just say again to her, through you, Mr Speaker, why I am against the ban proposed by the Labor Party. My philosophical view is that, if something is legal to sell, then in the absence of an overwhelming public interest case it should not be illegal to advertise it. - I am very happy to try to answer that if I am given the opportunity because I think there is a very important philosophical issue involved in this. I think the case in relation to smoking is quite different from the case in relation to junk food. There is nothing wrong with eating at McDonald's, it is how many you eat at McDonald's that is the problem. If you apply the philosophy of the Labor Party, you would ban altogether advertisements for alcohol, analgesics and Panadol. If you have too many Panadol it is bad, I understand, for your kidneys. If you have far too many Panadol it is bad for you, full stop. Where does it end? Do you put a ban on wine? Do you put a ban on alcohol?An honourable member - Coffee. - Coffee, too, because that has caffeine in it. And so the list goes on. This is an important issue. This whole idea that, according to the particular whims of the time, you should put a prohibition on advertising a product that is legal to sell establishes an extremely bad precedent. It is something that the government opposes and will continue to oppose. This, of course, does not in any way address the impact, once you start banning things, that the loss of revenue would have on the very effective and high-quality free-to-air television system that we have in this country. I think Australia has one of the best free-to-air television systems in the world. Our free-to-air television, given our population, is far better than the free-to-air television services of many other countries. Once you start going down this path, you can always mount an argument for going further. - I say again that the banning of tobacco was based upon the proposition that, from a health point of view, there is no such thing as a safe level of smoking. Yet there is such a thing as a safe level of consumption at McDonald's - that is the difference. If you apply the logic of the Leader of the Opposition, you should not have any advertisements for alcohol at all. The truth is that the human consequences that flow from the abuse of alcohol are far greater than the human consequences that flow from obesity, yet nobody is saying that we should ban alcohol nor do I hear the opposition saying we should have a ban on the advertising of alcohol. Heaven help the principle of freedom of expression in a commercial context if the member for Lalor ever gets her hands on the health portfolio. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson for her question. Recently the Australian Bureau of Statistics released Australian social trends 2004, which is category 4102.0. The ABS statistics show that, in relation to wages and household income, over the last eight years when this government has been in office real wages have increased by 14.1 per cent. That is an increase, over and above the cost of living, of 14.1 per cent. The previous government, the Labor Party, was in office for a longer period. It was in office for 13 years - not eight years - and, over those 13 years of Labor Party government, real wages increased 2.5 per cent compared to 14.1 per cent over the last eight years.Many of us who were in the parliament at that time remember how the Labor Party would actually boast about how they had a policy of cutting real wages, which was the genesis of the prices and incomes accord - led by such venerables as the now member for Hotham, in his previous reincarnation as the ACTU president. The ALP actually had an objective of cutting real wages. Let me give another comparison about family assistance. When this government came to office, the minimum family assistance payment was less than $600. From 1 July the minimum family tax benefit will be $1,695 - a practical way of helping families here in Australia under this government. In addition to that, from 1 July income tax will be further cut.When you break all of those statistics down, the real level of household disposable income has increased 28 per cent over the term of this government. That is more than a quarter and getting up to a third. Mr Speaker, you have often heard the expression - used quite carelessly, I believe - `The rich get richer and the poor get poorer.' This document on Australian social trends shows that the rich do get richer and the poor are getting richer in Australia as well. Household incomes for the different deciles, both at the bottom end and the top end, are increasing. That appears from the average real disposable household income comparisons between 1994 and 2001. So how is it that real wages can increase and household disposable income can increase for people at the bottom end of the income scale and at the top end? That can only be done in a growing economy. It can only be done at a time when you are creating 1.3 million new jobs and if you can balance your budgets, keep your inflation low and keep your interest rates down, reform your taxation system, move on your structural policy and keep Australia at the forefront of the economic performance of the developed world.There was a banking policy that was released on the weekend. It was replete with inquiries, analyses, new reports that were going to be done and all sorts of fandangles. But the one thing that banking policy did not have was a commitment to keeping interest rates low. That is a curious omission by the Australian Labor Party - a whole banking policy but not one commitment in relation to interest rates. Economic management takes discipline and consistency of purpose - you do not download your economic policy from the Google server on a day-to day basis. You have got to be interested in the big issues - the structural changes in the Australian economy. That is what this coalition government is focused on. We intend to continue doing it on behalf of the people of Australia. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. For her information - given that we all know how interested the member for Petrie is in the Australian seafood industry, particularly exports of Australian seafood - as a result of the negotiated agreement with the United States all Australian seafood exports will enter the US market duty free on day one, as soon as this agreement enters into force - that is, currently $140 million worth of exports out of Australia will enter duty free from day one.The benefits of the Australia-United States free trade agreement to the national interest have been clearly and broadly debated amongst the community in Australia and within this parliament. An economic analysis has been undertaken that indicates that after 10 years it will be worth $6 billion to the economy annually. Thousands of Australian exporters support what is being negotiated in this agreement: the billions of dollars worth of extra income for the beef and dairy industries; the immediate and complete opening up of the market for Australian lamb exports; the opportunity for Australia's manufacturers - particularly the automotive sector - to get access to the largest and most dynamic economy in the world.For 15 months we have been negotiating this agreement and for the last five months we have been debating it in this place and publicly in Australia, since the negotiations were concluded. There is a legally signed-off text available for scrutiny. The whole nation knows what is in this agreement. All the people that I mentioned can make a decision about whether we should go ahead with this agreement or not. Of course, overwhelmingly across Australia, the answer is that we should go ahead with this agreement.It is interesting to note, though, that the Leader of the Opposition still cannot make up his mind, unlike some of his colleagues, as to whether to support this agreement or not, notwithstanding the fact that six state Labor premiers and their governments - they are in government and they want economic development in their states - support this agreement. For all sorts of individual reasons, they see the benefit in this agreement for their states. Collectively, one would imagine, that ought to be good and in the national interest. Yet the Leader of the Opposition is still unable to come to terms with it after five months of deliberations. As the Prime Minister indicated, if we were to walk away from this we would be ridiculed across the world. We have put ourselves into a preferential position against most of our major competitors in terms of doing business in this market. If we were to step back from this we would automatically let them through the door ahead of us, and we would be abrogating our responsibility to represent the national interest if we did that. Of course, the government is not going to do that.We have the six state Labor premiers and the majority of business across Australia supporting that. The Leader of the Opposition even supports, without a question of doubt, the Singapore free trade agreement and the Thai free trade agreement. There has not been debate about those. There has not been question about those. Why is so much concern being raised about the negotiated agreement with the United States? We come to this week in the parliament. We will have the opportunity to debate the enabling legislation later this week. To borrow a phrase from the mentor of the Leader of the Opposition, it's time. It is time the Leader of the Opposition made up his mind. It is time the Leader of the Opposition showed some leadership over his divided party on this issue. It is time the Leader of the Opposition stopped playing politics with Australian jobs - and it is estimated, if we go ahead with this agreement, there will be 30,000 new Australian jobs. It is time the Leader of the Opposition supported the national interest and showed support for the Australia-US free trade agreement.</DOC>

 - I will tell you what they meet: the guidelines that you imposed when you were in government. That is what they meet. The member for Fraser was painfully aware of this when he was interviewed on television the other night. He was asked about the performance of the Keating government in this area. He made it very clear that the guidelines that are being followed are no different from the guidelines that were followed by the former government. We all remember the contribution of Bill Hunter. We all remember that. I point out to the member for Fraser that a very large number of the government campaigns include such things - and I would be interested to know whether the member for Fraser wants any of these discontinued - as campaigning against alcoholism and illegal drugs, especially amongst children, and encouraging parents to discuss these issues with their children; encouraging people to quit smoking; informing people about their ability to access funds for local environment projects through the Natural Heritage Trust; encouraging people to take out Australian citizenship; and urging young people to consider and employers to support apprenticeships. Let us look at the reality when compared with the sort of government advertising that goes on at a state government level. For example, for 2003 federal government advertising was $97 million; the state government advertising bill - and I think they were all Labor governments by 2003 - was $156 million for the six months to June 2003 only. So, if you assumed a continuation, you would have a figure of about $300 million versus $97 million from the federal government. And you are asking me about guidelines on government advertising! </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. I begin by acknowledging the member for Mallee's passionate interest in water. He is an engineer, and I think there could not be a more passionate advocate than he is for the water needs of his community, including of course the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline.Nothing could be more important than ensuring, in the driest inhabited continent on earth, that we use our water very carefully, that we plan carefully for the future, that the water goes where it can create the most value, the most jobs and the greatest export performance and that it is all done sustainably. So it is that water and its proper management is unquestionably one of the biggest issues that the nation faces. The premiers are coming to Canberra on Friday. In that context, I hope they are focusing on what needs to be done. Water is often thought of as a rural issue because that is where, believe it or not, 67 per cent of consumptive water is used. In reality, it involves all of us. I think all Australians know that not only because of the imagery of drought on their television screens but also because something like 80 per cent of Australians are at the moment facing water restrictions.In relation to where the water goes, yes, something like 67 per cent of Australia's water is used by the farm sector. But they are not the end users of that water. The people who eat the food and wear the clothing that that water produces are the end users of it. Of course, they live all around Australia and overseas, because our water produces enough food and fibre for some 80 million people around the world - a pretty astonishing performance. We have a responsibility to use that water wisely for high-quality, low-price produce not just for Australians but for people around the rest of the world as well.The COAG meeting on Friday will make a very important decision regarding our national water initiative - whether to agree to it and its principles or not. I believe this is very important to the future economic prosperity of all Australians as well as the security of the Australian agricultural sector. A major problem, a really serious problem, has arisen in recent years - that is, water users have experienced a fundamental loss of certainty and security in their water rights. The implications this has are profound. It affects their ability to plan, to invest, to get into better technology, to produce more with less water and indeed to have confidence to take a long-term view of sustainability.We find that, extraordinarily but in a very welcome development, we now have governments, farmers, environmentalists and scientists alike united in the view that certainty and security of access to water not only will facilitate investment, economic growth and innovation but is a vital key to achieving better sustainability outcomes. So we are on the brink of a historic opportunity for governments to put in place a framework to provide water users with the security they need to invest with confidence, to provide secure flows to the environment and to ensure fair dealing for the nation's water users. The government are firmly committed to this agreement. We are firmly committed to getting water management right for Australia, but we will not sign on to an agreement for the sake of an agreement. It has to provide the right framework to take us forward. Firstly, it must deliver that investment certainty by ensuring proper access entitlements. Secondly, it must develop a proper framework for measuring, monitoring and accounting for the nation's water - where it is, who owns it and where it is going to - because we do not have that at the moment. Thirdly, it must improve the efficiency of water use in urban areas. Fourthly, it must ensure that trading reforms deliver real outcomes and that water goes where it needs to and can best produce the right outcomes for the nation. Fifthly, it must ensure fair pathways for dealing with overallocation where that exists and ensure that risk assignment is properly handled.As the Prime Minister said in this place last week, the 25 June meeting is a make-or-break meeting. We cannot go on talking about this issue forever. I had hoped when we checked the web site that that might have come up at the Labor Party's country conference. I can find nothing on their web site. That does not mean that nothing was said; it does not even mean that there was nothing put on the web site. There could have been something, but there is not at the moment. That is disappointing because, to be fair, many of their state colleagues have provided a bit of leadership here. We are looking for them to complete that next Friday.About the best we have had, apart from a bit of mumbling about the Murray-Darling from the Leader of the Opposition, has been from my opposite number, the member for Batman, who suggested that Australians could perhaps use a bit less water when they wash their cars. That is about as sophisticated a policy approach as we have had from him. It is time to move beyond that. State governments must sign on to a high-quality national water initiative so that we can move on, particularly to get some real expenditure under way in relation to the Living Murray process.</DOC>

 - I can inform the member for Lalor that the bulk-billing rate has gone up as a result of the MedicarePlus package, which members opposite opposed tooth and nail. I can also inform the member for Lalor that any advertising that this government does is providing legitimate information to the Australian people, such as the information currently being provided to the Australian people about the brand-new MedicarePlus safety net - a safety net that members opposite are pledged to rip away from people, thereby exposing people with the highest health costs to more suffering and more hardship. Any advertising that the government spends money on is about federal government programs and federal government benefits for people, unlike members opposite. When members opposite were in government, they spent $5.5 million just before the 1993 election on - you know what? - advertising public hospital entitlements. Public hospital entitlements are entirely provided by the state governments. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I can say that one of the reasons why the Australian economy has been able to grow, notwithstanding the East Asian financial crisis and the US recession over recent years, is that we have run balanced budgets. We have now repaid $70 billion in net terms of Labor's $96 billion debt. The debt to GDP ratio in Australia is now about three per cent. All of that could be threatened by an incoming government with a Whitlamite agenda. I was very interested to wake up on Sunday morning and read my Sunday Age newspaper, which announced:Since winning the Labor leadership 200 days ago, Mr Latham has made 200 promises ......	...	...The price tag for the 200 promises has topped $10 billion over four years.And there they all were. The Sunday Age said that that $10 billion of savings is going to be paid for, Labor says:... by reallocating existing government spending and measures such as a tax on the mining industry.So a tax on the mining industry is apparently going to pay for $10 billion of profits. This, of course, is the secret $8 billion list. After nearly choking on my weeties as I read the Sunday Age, I flicked across to the SundayHerald Sun. The Sunday Age had just told me about Labor's $10 billion spend proposal and the Sunday Herald Sun told me about Labor's new tax policy, which is to give a tax break of $520 a year to low-income workers at a cost over the forward estimates of $11.2 billion. The paper says the opposition leader, Mark Latham, said that Labor had identified $8 billion in savings to fund a broader TaxPack.It is the most amazing thing, isn't it? You have $8 billion of savings which is going to fund $10 billion of new spending and $11 billion of tax cuts. Most of us would say that $11 billion plus $10 billion is $21 billion to fund out of $8 billion of savings but, no, not the Labor Party. That $8 billion of savings funds $10 billion of expenditure and $11 billion of tax reductions. This is all in the $8 billion list, which Alan Jones was told was in a document that the public could look at. It is the famous airbrushed transcript; the 2GB 14 May list. I said, did I not, on Thursday that the whole of Australia wants to look at this list? This list can fund $10 billion of expenditure and $11 billion worth of tax cuts.The member for Moreton gave me a copy on the way down to the chamber of Labor's economic adviser's book. I have Labor's economic adviser's book here. Labor's economic adviser is Mr Norman Lindsay, who wrote a book called The Magic Pudding. If they get elected, Labor are going to give three books to every child. Can I nominate one of them? Can I put this in the hands of every single Australian child? It is the story, as it says here, `about a very unusual puddin'.' It continues: Whistle three times, turn it round and it's steak-and-kidney, if that's what you fancy, or hot jam roll, or delicious apple dumpling. Its manners are appalling, but it tastes so good! And it loves, just loves, to be eaten:'Eat away, chew away.munch and bolt and guzzle, Never leave the table till you'refull up to the muzzle.'Sounds like a Labor spending program, doesn't it? I was discussing this with the member for Warringah. He thinks that the shadow minister for health may not approve of this puddin'. There could be a lot of junk food in this puddin'. Fancy telling kids about things like jam rolls or delicious apple dumplings. I wonder if The Magic Pudding will make it through the thought police of the Australian Labor Party, to get on that list of three books that could go to every Australian child.We still have the case of the missing airbrushed transcript. Last Thursday, when Mr Jones asked, `The public can look at this list?' Mr Latham said, `Yes, I've got that right here in front of me.' We cannot wait. Whether it is a jam roll or a steak and kidney pie or whether it is something else, show us the list, because it is sure going to be a beauty.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As per usual, the Deputy Prime Minister was telling the truth. We on this side can vouch for the veracity of the Deputy Prime Minister. The AusLink announcement was made in the budget and, from memory, I think we set out $11 billion over the forward estimates in existing and new funding for both road and rail. - All of those projects, as I said before, have been factored in. They have been announced. The forward estimates have been put out and they are accounted for in the budget. Those projects will be fully funded - each and every one of them. - We have set out all of those projects, and they will be fully funded -  - As I said, under the AusLink program we have set out the expenditures in relation to road and rail. We have announced the forward estimates in relation to those projects, including the year-by-year, and they will all be fully funded. This government has now produced seven surplus budgets. We have reduced Labor debt by $70 billion and the debt to GDP ratio is three per cent. This government has the runs on the board in relation to financial management. We can compare that with the Australian Labor Party in which the member for Hotham proudly served. The last five budgets were deficit budgets. They ran to the 1996 election saying there would be a surplus when the budget was then $10 billion in deficit, and they ran up an additional $70 billion of net debt over those last five years.There is one way the Labor Party, if it really is serious that it has changed its ways, can open itself up to scrutiny: it can release the list which the Leader of the Opposition promised was in front of him on 14 May and would be available to the public. It can announce its $11 billion tax policy -  - and it can go through the $10 billion of expenditures. I am going to put this on the record, because the last two times -  - The last two times when the member for Hotham was engaged in putting forward policies which could have been costed under the Charter of Budget Honesty, he failed to get his policies out in time for an independent costing during the election campaign. I can remember the last campaign. We were on the Thursday night before the election, and they still had not produced the policies for costing under the Charter of Budget Honesty. The member for Hotham has a track record in relation to these matters. Labor promised they would have their tax policy out during budget week. They promised Alan Jones there was a public list. They promised that they would put their policies out for costing. They have failed to do so. They are some $21 billion short at the moment, and I call on the Australian Labor Party to let the Australian public in on the secret.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I recognise not only the interest he has in the role of the Australian Defence Force personnel in Iraq but the support he provides to them as well. On this side of the House, we know that the Australian Defence Force is playing a vital role in Iraq, helping that country to rebuild after three decades of tyranny and, of course, on this side of the House we are delighted to see the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's tyrannical regime. And, let me add, we are very proud of having played a role in the overthrow of that tyranny, because the Liberal Party and the Nationals will always stand up against tyranny. -  - The Labor Party laughs. They should go and look at some of the resolutions from the 1938 conference and see what they said about standing up to tyranny. One of the key examples of what we are doing in Iraq is through our C130 Hercules. Their crews are doing an excellent job as part of our troops in Iraq. As I said in the House last Wednesday, they have completed over 400 missions, moving 9,300 people and conducting 925 aeromedical evacuations, and as long as our troops remain in Iraq they will require that service. That troop commitment is vital too to the advancement of Australian interests. Our trainers are helping Iraqis to stabilise their own country. That is important to the Middle East, and it is vital to the war against terrorism. Are there any other views? I think I have been able to demonstrate over the last week that the policy of the opposition - of the Leader of the Opposition in particular - on this question of troops in Iraq is a complete shambles. In his so-called `cut and run' policy mess, the Leader of the Opposition moved from telling the Australian public he wanted to withdraw all troops from Iraq by Christmas to saying, `Well, actually, all the time I have been telling everybody there will be a partial pullout.' This is in a way the worst of all options, because you leave those troops in Iraq without logistical support and you send a message to the terrorists that we are going to cut and run. That is the wrong message to send: it is the wrong message to send to terrorists; it is the wrong message to send to our alliance partners -  -  - including the Americans, yes - and it will make Australia look a weak country, which is something that we have not done in the past and we should not be doing in the future. I spoke last Wednesday or Thursday about the C130 Hercules, and I noticed that the member for Griffith was on Lateline being interviewed about this question. It was an interesting interview. - The Prime Minister saw it as well. You often get very interesting interviews on Lateline. The member for Griffith was particularly droll in this interview. The shadow minister for defence has told us - and the Leader of the Opposition would, if he had the courage to stand up and talk about this issue - that Labor's policy is to withdraw the C130s. On Lateline the member for Griffith, who is the shadow minister for foreign affairs, said: `As far as the detailed decision on this' - that is, the withdrawal of the C130s - `is concerned, there will be an appropriate decision at the time by people with on-the-ground experience.' But, hang on, Mr Speaker, the shadow minister has already made a decision and announced it: Labor is going to withdraw the C130s. But according to the member for Griffith, `We are going to make a decision on that later on.' That is just like the situation when the Leader of the Opposition says Labor is going to withdraw all our troops, only the member for Griffith says, `We will make a decision on the 86 troops protecting our embassy later on.' The farce, if I may say so, just rolls on and on, every time an opposition spokesman is interviewed on this issue. We still await, by the way, the statement by the Leader of the Labor Party on what Labor's true position is on this issue.The Leader of the Opposition is still standing by his statement that the role of our forces in Iraq is merely symbolic and the member for Griffith was talking about tin soldiers on Lateline the other night. The member for Griffith is ever garrulous. I was heading out to a function in my electorate on Saturday night, and I thought, `I'll just catch the ABC news before I go.' There he was again, the member for Griffith - always with a slightly unbelievable statement, always, if I may say so, Mr Speaker, with plenty of ammunition for his political opponents. This time he passed us a bit of ammunition: he said, `An election campaign based on national security is John Howard's national diversion strategy.' What? National security is a national diversion? Actually, national security is the most fundamental responsibility of the national government - not, if I may say so to the member for Griffith, a diversion strategy. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question and commence by advising her that the $36 million which is being rorted from the average Australian worker with the Centenary House deal would have funded at least 3,500 university places. It is interesting to hear this question, because back in January the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was running around Australia telling Australians that 70,000 people had missed out on university places. In fact, the reality was revealed when the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee published the final figure for eligible unmet demand - 19,300 to 24,000. It was a figure which had dropped from last year, but the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was nowhere to be found.What Australians need to understand is that 20,000 eligible Australians missed out on a university place this year but there are 40,000 who, having got a place this year, will have left by the end of the year and will never return. Of the 228,000 who started a university course this year, there are 100,000 who will not complete that course at all. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition thinks that 20,000 people missing out on a university place - when 40,000, by the way, got a place and will drop out and never come back - in the space of one year is bad, how would she feel about 146,000? When the Labor Party was in government in 1993, the Australian newspaper reported, `146,000 miss out on university places.' What has happened under this government is that there have been more opportunities and more places, and over the next five years there will be another 35,000 fully funded HECS places. At the same time, the Labor Party has got a $1 billion funding hole in its own higher education policy - explain that to the Australian people!</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question, because, in common with all members of the Howard government, Medicare is an article of faith with the member for Dunkley. Since 1996 we have preserved it, we have protected it and we have strengthened it. We have backed words with deeds and we have backed deeds with dollars. Since October last year we have spent an extra $4 billion on Medicare, which means more doctors and nurses into general practice, more bulk-billing and, above all else, the brand-new Howard government safety net to protect people with high out-of-pocket out-of-hospital health costs. While the Howard government has been the best friend that Medicare has ever had, it seems that members opposite are having second thoughts about Medicare.  - There is an alternative policy and it is going to be presented by premiers Bracks and Carr to the COAG conference later this week. - Premier Bracks has commissioned a major study by the Allen Consulting Group. I table chapter 8 of that study. It is described as `cabinet-in-confidence' and it is dated 26 April this year. The Bracks-Carr plan, supported by John Brumby's former chief of staff, the member for Lalor - the Bracks-Carr-Gillard plan - involves pooling all federal and state health spending under the control of a national health commission. This is a $60 billion bureaucratic behemoth that would be accountable to no-one and elected by no-one, and that is the Labor Party's Medicare policy.The Labor Party wants to reform Medicare out of existence: the $8 billion Medicare benefits schedule - gone; the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme - gone; $4 billion of aged care spending - gone! What Labor is toying with would be the end of Medicare as we know it. Instead of having demand-driven patient-initiated programs such as the MBS and the PBS, we would have a world of queues and rationing reminiscent of nothing so much as the British National Health Service at its worst.I call on Premier Bracks to make public the whole of the Allen Consulting Group document. I also call on him to reveal how much the Victorian government has paid to prepare federal Labor's policy for it. Most of all, I call on the member for Lalor, the shadow minister for health, to explain precisely what she means when she says she supports the pooling of all health care funding, and I want her to explain to this parliament and to the Australian people why she wants to tamper with the world's best health system.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lilley for his question, because it gives an opportunity for the government to talk about its very proud record when it comes to child care. Indeed, since we came to government the number of child-care places has gone up by 73 per cent - that is, from 300,000 to over 530,000 places. When you look at outside school hours care you see a 234 per cent increase in places. When you look at family day care you see a 23 per cent increase in places. There has even been a 22 per cent increase in child-care services. The member for Lilley asks about some areas where there is unmet demand. I am very happy to inform him that one of the measures in the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy that was mentioned only a couple of weeks ago in connection with the child-care support program is incentives for long day care centres to be established in areas of unmet demand. For the first time we have made provision for centres that can go into outer metropolitan areas and regional and rural areas. That was never available under the Australian Labor Party. Frankly, the greatest risks to the child-care sector are the attitude taken by the ACTU, where you call long day care providers abhorrent and you call the corporates evil, and your consistent policy of talking it down. - When it comes to advertising, why don't you hand back the $6,721 that, as the minister for health eloquently says, you trouser every day for Centenary House?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question and for taking me to one of the finest schools in the country, Kepnock State High School in Bundaberg. This government believes very strongly in quality education and in choice in education. Australians, having paid their taxes to support what should be well-resourced state schools which are funded, run and largely administered by state governments, should be free to choose the kind of school that they think best meets the educational aspirations that they have for their children. This week the Prime Minister and this government will be announcing not only record funding for schools over the next four years but also a determination to drive standards, quality and national consistency right across Australia in school education.I am asked about alternative policies. It is somewhat difficult to get the full detail of alternative policies but, for example, on 26 March this year at the William Carey Christian School in Sydney, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was asked about school resourcing. She said, `Well, as I was just mentioning, the No. 1 issue is fees.' She was then asked whether it was just a handful of schools that were going to be affected and have their funding cut under a Labor government, and she said, `It's more than a handful, because once you go into Melbourne as well as Sydney there's many.'The following day the Australian Financial Review, in reporting this, said:Mr Latham's press release specifically mentions Sydney's The Kings School as overfunded, but his education spokeswoman, Jenny Macklin, has previously singled out a number of schools, and one of those was the Bunbury Cathedral Grammar School in Western Australia. So the Labor Party is saying to Australians that in government it will reduce the level of assistance to parents on the basis of the fees charged by the school. So the higher the sacrifice made by the parents the less assistance they will receive from a Labor government.Bunbury Cathedral Grammar School charges $9,200 a year in fees. That means that there are at least 127 non-government schools in Australia - educating 123,000 Australian children - that will have their funding cut under a Latham Labor government. The Australian Labor Party needs to come clean now and tell us which those schools are. If you do go to Melbourne, Mr Speaker, you might go to the Mount Scopus Memorial College in the electorate of Chisholm. There are 1,300 students there - Australian children. Or you could go to the Mount Scopus Memorial College at St Kilda East, at Gandel Besen House. I would like to see the member for Melbourne Ports turn up there and explain to Jewish families why their kids are worthy of less support for their education under a Labor government. If there is one thing that the Jewish community knows a lot about it is sacrifice and making sacrifices for your kids to get a better education. As to other policies, we know that when the Leader of the Opposition was Labor's education spokesman he felt very passionately about his education policy - so much so that when he put it to the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for Brand, it was completely rubbed out. In fact, after the election in October 1998 Alan Ramsey reported:His voice came burning down the line. His anger even still was intense. Yet Mark Latham regrets nothing, he says, to be treated like dirt.So what did he feel he was being treated like dirt about? What is there that he felt so passionately about that it made him seethe with anger and go to the back bench for a couple of years? What was it in that policy? Brian Toohey reported it the following month, in November 1998, in an article entitled `Homework police'. He said:Mark Latham wanted parents to lose social security benefits unless they agreed to let retired teachers into their homes to monitor compliance with homework requirements.Can you believe that in this day and age the leader of a major political party would feel so strongly about that? He also said:Latham wants to start with the long-term unemployed by cutting their benefits if they do not agree to help their kids with homework.So the homework police are going to knock on your door at four o'clock in the afternoon and find out whether your kids have done their homework and whether their parents are helping them with it. If not, they have to go to a monthly democracy education class. It would be funny if it were not so serious, but this is the kind of Australia that we are likely to see under a Labor government, where some kids are considered to be of so little value that they get less - if any - money for their education and the novice nanny leader is going to come into their homes with the homework police at four o'clock in the afternoon. The Labor Party needs to come clean on its policy and it needs to do so immediately.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition starts talking about attacking small business, but I would have thought that 21 per cent interest rates were a bit of a frontal attack on small business. All of the policies that our government have followed - and I am very proud and ready to include in that the magnificent contribution of the member for North Sydney and Minister for Small Business and Tourism - have been designed to create what is clearly the case: we have the best economic conditions for small business of any time since World War II. So, far from attacking small business with high interest rates, high inflation and brutal industrial relations legislation, we have altered the landscape so that the levels of confidence in small business are higher than they have been, certainly at any time in the last 20 years, and arguably higher than at any time since World War II.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Aston. I know that he gives our Defence Force personnel working in Iraq enormous support and his constituents appreciate that. As he knows, the Australian Defence Force is making a vital contribution in Iraq. There are 86 Australian Defence Force personnel who are defending our representative office there and its officials; 65 who are training the Iraqi army and navy to improve security in Iraq; 65 who are operating the air traffic control in Baghdad at the international airport; the HMAS Stuart, which is defending Iraq from terrorist attacks in the Persian Gulf as it did in relation to the Basra oil terminal in April; and the P3C Orions, which provide surveillance for coalition operations in Iraq. We are immensely proud of these Australian Defence Force personnel who risk their lives every day in the cause of freedom in Iraq.As to whether there are any alternative views, there is the shambles of the Labor Party's policy. Those of us who had the privilege of watching the 7.30 Report last night and seeing a rather underconfident and uncertain Leader of the Opposition suddenly saw emerging from the gloom of the interview Labor's seventh policy on troops in Iraq. Let us just go through it. Back in November last year, the member for Griffith wrote a letter to the Prime Minister. I am sure that the House has forgotten this. He said:... now that regime change has occurred -  in Iraq -  ... it is the opposition's view that it is now the responsibility of all people of goodwill, both in this country and beyond, to put their shoulder to the wheel in an effort to build a new Iraq.Those are fine words from the member for Griffith in November last year. But time moved on and policy No. 2 was heard on 2UE with Mike Carlton. On 23 March, the Leader of the Opposition said: `Troops home by Christmas - all troops home by Christmas.' That is what we heard. The cut-and-run policy was announced.Within a few days, the spokesman for the Leader of the Opposition was articulating the third policy to the Age newspaper on 27 March, which was that perhaps HMAS Melbourne, which was then the frigate that we had in the Gulf, and the P3C aircrews would remain, but everyone else would be out. Then there was the Lowy lecture given by the Leader of the Opposition on 7 April. There were no ifs and no buts in that speech. That was the `troops home by Christmas' speech. Suddenly all of the troops were coming home by Christmas.But hang on. Not many days passed, and we had the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, the member for Griffith, realising the folly in that we might actually need some troops in Iraq to guard the Australian diplomats and officials there, otherwise we would have to close the office. So the Lowy speech was `all troops out' but on 26 May, a month later, the member for Griffith was saying that `the responsible course of action is to get advice from the diplomatic security adviser on how best to secure the mission' - so there was the possibility that troops would stay.Then we heard that the C130s were going to be pulled out. So we were keeping some troops there to protect the representative office but we had no supply for it, and the opposition thought maybe we could go and beg the Americans to provide that assistance. That was policy No. 6.Since last night we are now up to policy No. 7. Through the fog came the faint cry of a Leader of the Opposition with no interest whatsoever in detail, a Leader of the Opposition with no interest in major policy issues, saying that the troops operating within Iraq would be withdrawn by Christmas. So what is the Leader of the Opposition saying? That the representative office will be closed. The Leader of the Opposition is saying he will not leave any troops behind to protect the Australian representative office. So the office will be closed. This, of course, contrasts very dramatically with the member for Griffith's position, and he is now left hung out to dry.The Leader of the Opposition said last night that HMAS Stuart and the Orions could stay because they were part of Operation Slipper, that they could stay because they are part of the war against terrorism. But if the terrorists cross the border into Iraq then that ship and those aircraft cannot operate in the Iraqi theatre. That is the position of the Leader of the Opposition. The confusion of the opposition on one central policy issue - an important policy issue - and the fact that the Leader of the Opposition cannot get this simple policy right is, I think, a guide to why he cannot produce a tax policy, because if you think that this is too complicated then imagine how confused the Leader of the Opposition is with his own tax policy. - </DOC>

 - In reply to the member for Fraser, I assure him that the Treasurer and I will continue our highly successful partnership of the last 8½ years to create and maintain the best economic conditions that small business has had for many years. I can assure the member for Fraser that the Treasurer and I will be combining, over the weeks - indeed months, and beyond that into the future - to maintain those conditions for small business. And, importantly, if you want to get the monkey off the back of small business, you will pass those unfair dismissal laws.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. I can inform him that today the ABS released statistics on dwelling unit commencements for the March quarter. They showed that the total number of dwelling unit commencements fell by 2.7 per cent. You can put this together with commencements of houses, which fell 3.3 per cent in the March quarter. This confirms what the government forecast in its budget: that housing market indicators, including finance data, auction clearance rates and house prices are all pointing to an easing in house price activity. I have been saying for 12 to 18 months that you could not expect the kind of growth in house prices that we have seen in Australia to continue indefinitely. The government in fact welcomes the plateauing of prices; the government in fact welcomes cooling in the housing market.Having said that, I should add that the government does not welcome the completely incompetent intervention from the New South Wales government in relation to the housing market. It chose this time of all times - with dwelling unit commencements turning down and the market cooling - to introduce an entirely new tax on property investors. We have seen some incompetent economic management coming from state governments in this country, but this one coming out of the New South Wales Labor government must rank as one of the rankest of all. It is a move which has apparently not raised an eyebrow from federal Labor. Federal Labor has had nothing to say about the Carr government's new taxes. Obviously, federal Labor has a few new taxes of its own in mind should it come to government in this country.Let me also comment on motor vehicle sales for the month of May. The data released for new motor vehicle sales in May showed a 2.1 per cent increase, with new motor vehicle sales 3.1 per cent higher than a year ago. The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries is predicting new car sales will reach a record of 960,000 in 2004 - an all-time record for motor vehicle sales in Australia. This has been led in particular by businesses purchasing new vehicles. Why would that be? Why would we now be at an all-time record in relation to new motor vehicle sales? The first thing is that we abolished a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on cars and replaced it with a 10 per cent GST. If you happen to be a business buyer, because you get a credit for the GST you paid when you bought the car, you effectively buy tax free. Since we are on the theme of small business today, we ought to remember this: if the Australian Labor Party had had its way, every small business in Australia would be paying 22 per cent wholesale sales tax more for their cars than they are today. - In comes the member for Wills with one of the most incompetent and ignorant interjections. He says they have to pay the GST. If he had opened his ears, he would have heard me say that business gets a credit for its GST. So business in fact pays nothing in relation to motor vehicles. It is always the most inopportune statement and the most inane comment from the member for Wills. Business pays no GST. If Labor had had its way, all small businesses in this country would be paying a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on vehicles purchased for their business, including their tractors and their utes and all the things they bring in to their business. If Labor had had its way, small business taxes would be much higher than they are today and the Australian economy would be much weaker.</DOC>

 - In the 8½ years that I have been Prime Minister of this country, I have been on the side of people who have borrowed from the banks, because I have presided over the lowest interest rates in 30 years. You can have all your complicated policy and all your rhetoric, but what really matters to the average Australian is what you deliver. When Labor was in office, it delivered housing interest rates of 17 per cent, it delivered small business rates of 21 per cent and it delivered bank bill rates for Australian farmers of 23 per cent. Since we have been in office, we have presided over the lowest interest rate regime this country has had for 30 years. I am confident that the borrowers of Australia will remember that long beyond the rhetoric and puffery of last weekend from the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. The member for Page is very cognisant of the importance of the Australia-United States free trade agreement to his electorate, particularly the agricultural producers - the beef and dairy producers - in his area that so desperately need new markets and increased market capacity.The Australia-United States free trade agreement is the most significant bilateral trade agreement to be negotiated in Australia's history. It is an opportunity to strengthen and deepen our economic ties with a dynamic economy and a market of almost 300 million people. Importantly, it is an opportunity for us to get ahead of the pack, to get ahead of the rest of our competitors, in getting into that market. Many of those competitors are queuing up to negotiate similar agreements with the United States.  We will introduce the enabling legislation into the parliament tomorrow to enable debate about this agreement. But it should be noted that this is not our first free trade agreement. Twenty-one years ago we concluded the closer economic relationship agreement with New Zealand. Since then, our government has negotiated and concluded free trade agreements with Singapore and Thailand. It is even more interesting to note that the 2001 Australian Labor Party election policy pledged to finalise the then already started free trade agreement with Singapore, noting that it would enhance the `close economic relationship' between Australia and Singapore. After that, Labor welcomed the free trade agreement we negotiated with Thailand. Their trade spokesman, Senator Conroy, described it as `an important step in the development of our trade policy'.Yet when the government announced that we had concluded a negotiation with the United States earlier this year, the first reaction of the Leader of the Opposition was to say that Labor would oppose the deal. His gut reaction - his instinct - was to say that they would oppose the deal. We need to ask ourselves why. Why can't the Leader of the Opposition make up his mind as quickly on this agreement as Labor did on the Singapore agreement and the Thai agreement and their commitment when they actually concluded and signed the closer economic relationship agreement with New Zealand 21 years ago?Even since then we have seen all six Labor premiers - the six Labor leaders in office, who have the responsibility of governing their states - across Australia support this agreement because they know it is in the interests of their states. We heard today the member for Corio, the Labor Party spokesman on agriculture. He has made up his mind. He told the NFF this morning that the FTA legislation ought to be supported at this stage. That is the member for Corio. Informed members of the Labor Party - the six Labor state premiers and the member for Corio - have been able to make up their minds about the benefits of the FTA. They know that it is good for Australia. What they do not know is what their leader is prepared to do and whether he is prepared to put aside his anti-Americanism and support a deal that is good for Australia and is in the national interest.</DOC>

 - Let me thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that what he based his question on was dishonest. It was a quite dishonest statement. Let me read this out - and let the House follow this - to give you an example of what a devious and slimy question that really was. This is the question that I was asked by the member for Lalor:My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the research conducted by Professor Boyd Swinburn ...In the interests of time, I will paraphrase it: `Why don't you support the Labor Party's ban?' This is what I said:I thank the member for Lalor for her question. Let me just say again to her, through you, Mr Speaker, why I am against the ban proposed by the Labor Party. My philosophical view is that, if something is legal to sell, then in the absence of an overwhelming public interest case it should not be illegal to advertise it.The fact that later on I made a reference to the impact on free-to-air television does not in any way alter this. -  - I made it very clear what the philosophical basis of it was. I thank the Leader of the Opposition again for giving me an opportunity to repeat my position. My position is very simple: if something is legal to sell, in the absence of an overwhelming public case to the opposite, we have a right in this country to advertise it. We had some debate yesterday about smoking, alcohol and a few other things. It happens to be the case in this country - and I say this in further reply to what was raised by the member for Lalor - that of course you have a ban on alcohol advertisements during children's programs, because the last time I checked it was illegal for children to consume alcohol. The last time I checked, it was not illegal for children to consume McDonald's. It might be undesirable for them to eat too much McDonald's, but, while there is not a safe level of consumption of tobacco, there is a safe level of consumption of McDonald's. In the absence of excess consumption of it, I do not think there is a case advanced by the Labor Party.What Labor would do is to ban all food and drink advertisements during programs classified as children's programs and also general programs which are likely to be widely watched by children. That would include bans on Woolworths fresh food. It would include bans on milk advertisements. It would include bans on bottled water advertisements. It would include bans on a whole lot of advertisements of things that could not be classified as junk food. I said yesterday that there could be no justification for that unless you wanted to argue that you should ban analgesics being advertised. There is a safe level of use of analgesics, but if they are used too often they can do great damage to your health. The same thing can be said, of course, in relation to alcohol. I think the Labor Party's position is illogical. I think it does represent a threat, as I said yesterday, to the free-to-air television system, but the basis of my objection is the philosophical one I outlined, and not my answer as deliberately distorted by the Leader of the Opposition. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. I remind the House that not in this year's budget and not in last year's budget but in the budget brought down on 14 May 2002 the government announced proposals for copayments to put the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme on a sustainable basis. Copayments had been introduced by the Labor Party in 1990. In that 2002 budget the government proposed to increase the copayment for pensioners by $1 and to increase the payment for others by $6.20. Both of these schemes have a safety net - that is, if you are a pensioner, after 52 scripts in the year you get the remainder of your scripts free for that year. If you are a non-pensioner, after you have paid $874.90 in a particular year you drop down to the concessional rate.We announced that that would take effect from 1 July 2002. As the Intergenerational Report of the Commonwealth had shown, there was no faster growing area of Commonwealth expenditure than the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and our projections showed that it would increase to 3.4 per cent of GDP in 40 years time. Unless measures were put in place to make it financially sustainable, Australians would be denied access to high-quality and new drugs. That measure has been stoutly resisted by the Australian Labor Party since its announcement on 14 May 2002. So imagine my surprise to see that on the Channel 10 news this morning - 25 months after the announcement - Paul Bongiorno did a live cross and reported as follows: `There were heated discussions in caucus this morning. The Labor leader, backed by Simon Crean and Bob McMullan, pushed Labor to reverse its opposition to government moves introduced last year' - it was not last year; it was 2002 - `to make changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Labor will now support those changes and is calling on the Treasurer to activate the bill.' - I have been delaying on this bill, yes! For 25 months that bill has been either sitting in the Senate or rejected by the Australian Labor Party. For 25 months the Australian Labor Party has had the opportunity to pass that bill. The Australian Labor Party has opposed that bill in the House of Representatives and in the Senate and in the community and in committee for the last 25 months. Now the Australian Labor Party calls on me to activate the bill. As recently as January of this year - and this is a transcript which has not yet been airbrushed, so I ask people to get onto the web site - the Leader of the Opposition, with Joseph Thomsen on ABC Radio in South Australia, said: In the last 18 months ... we've been blocking increases in pharmaceutical expenses. The Government's trying to put it up $6.50 for families, $1.00 for pensioners and Labor has been saying no ...That was on 14 January 2004. Let me say that if the Labor Party takes 25 months to come around to the right decision, we welcome it; we absolutely welcome it. This is one of those occasions where the coalition absolutely welcome the backflip by the Leader of the Opposition. We ask only one question: why did it take 25 months?Now that the Labor Party is in the mood for backflips, can we give you a suggested agenda for your next party meeting? The unfair dismissal laws have been rejected 40 times, so maybe Labor could do a backflip in relation to those. The disability pension reforms have been rejected, just as those Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme ones were rejected, and have been waiting 25 months for passing. There is a very long list of government legislation that we would welcome Labor backflips in relation to.We know why Labor has backflipped on this one. Labor has been stung by the fact that it has made $10 billion worth of promises and $11 billion of tax cuts. It plans on having a bigger surplus and investing in an intergenerational fund. Somebody has said, `The magic pudding doesn't quite work that way any more, so let's try and clear the decks in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.' I point out, by the way, that some of the savings from that measure have already been lost, because the fact of the matter is that the copayments have been indexed since the measure was announced. So you are no longer putting it up by $1; the indexation has taken it from $3.60 to $3.80 and an increase to $4.60 would be an increase of only 80c. Somebody says it may have even gone to $4; my information is $3.80. But in any event, some of those savings have already been lost because of that 25-month delay.This is good policy, and I welcome the fact that the Labor Party is now supporting it. It always was good policy. It was only opportunism that led the Labor Party to take the position that it did. It is only opportunism that keeps the Labor Party opposing matters like unfair dismissal. Whilst the Labor Party is in the mood for backflips, let us continue the process.</DOC>

 - I am amazed that the member for Lilley knows when the election date is going to be. Perhaps it is something that he could share with us. I will tell you what we are sharing with the Australian people: through good economic management we have been able to return a significant social dividend to Australian families - that is, the $600 payment that FTB part A customers have received last week or will receive this week. They are going to receive it again in September. The greatest risk to Australian families when it comes to not receiving that $600 is from the Australian Labor Party, who have refused to guarantee that $600 in the next financial year. I am sure that, if I were one of the 9,700 families in the member for Lilley's electorate, I would appreciate that $600 payment and, if I were one of the 17,000 families in the member for Werriwa's electorate, I would welcome that payment. Indeed, the greatest risk - as I mentioned before - is that the Australian Labor Party have refused that $600 payment in future years. We are going to see a Latham lunge and clawback in the next financial years, because you have refused to guarantee it.No wonder we have to have an advertising campaign when we hear mistruths coming from the Australian Labor Party, because they have failed to guarantee that $600. I was doorknocking in the area of Ocean Shores in my community on the weekend and I must say that, when I knocked on their doors, people said, `We'd like to thank the government and thank Mr Howard for that $600 and future payments, all because of good economic management by the coalition government.'</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question and note his real interest, shared by everyone on this side of the House, in regional development and in better opportunities for people who live in the regions across the nation. It is the case that the national conference of the ACC chairs is being held in Canberra tomorrow. We have a good opportunity for the 56 area consultative committee chairs to come here, talk to us and refine and develop the techniques they use to deliver stronger regional growth and more job opportunities in this vast nation's far-flung rural communities. They are not all rural communities, but many of them are.I want to say that we highly value the work that the ACCs do. They are an essential part of what we call the partnership approach to growing local communities. They bring communities, businesses and governments together to drive local solutions to local problems. It is all about local empowerment. There is no doubt that the many members in this place enjoy their relationships with their local ACCs and they work very closely with them. Indeed, since 1996 ACCs have driven development worth more than $900 million and, in many cases, they put together quite innovative local solutions using a lot of the tools that we have made available, including such things as the rural transaction centres, which the Prime Minister referred to yesterday. There are 118 towns with face-to-face banking back again.I remember the Labor Party's attitude here. I remember former Prime Minister Keating being asked about bank closures at Ivanhoe and the arrogant and dismissive answer he gave that, basically, he did not give a damn about regional services and whether they had their banks or not. I will tell you what: never listen to what the Labor Party say about rural services; only look at what they do. And so it is that they have used the various tools we have made available - the telecommunications funding for black spots for radio and television and so forth - and their own local initiatives to make a lot of difference for a lot of Australians. I am asked if I am aware of alternative ways of doing this. This is a classic example of where you get this great disconnect between what the Labor Party say and what they actually do. The member for Batman, who rarely has anything much to contribute to the debate - and I really do wonder what he does do in terms of policy development - set down some principles for regional service delivery in November 2002. There were three very high-minded principles. Firstly, he said:The structure must rise from the community. It must not be imposed from above.That is what we have always said about regional development. Secondly, he said:It must, wherever possible, tap into existing structures and people.Thirdly, he said:It must not impose a new, inaccessible layer of control.Great principles - firm principles. There are, incidentally, I cannot help observing, a lot of Labor Party members in the seat of Kingsford Smith who would think they were exceptionally sound principles and ought to be respected by the Labor Party. If you design your programs with those sorts of principles in mind, you come up pretty much with what we have come up with. But then, of course, the member for Batman had to put it to his ALP conference, so the three principles ended up looking a bit different. The first principle was:The structure must rise from the community. It must not be imposed from above.The policy result from the ALP when it went to their conference was that a plan for each region would be developed by the state and federal governments and local government and locked in under a memorandum of understanding - in other words, `We will impose it from on top.' The second principle: the new plan must `tap into existing structures and people'. - We hear the member for Hotham - he always interjects usefully - who says, `Who invented the ACCs? Who set them up?' It is all the Labor Party's idea and they want to take the credit for it. The member for Batman says, `They're a useless waste of money and should be wound up.' Which is it to be? What is your position? It is your great invention. You think they are terrific. You want to meet with them, but you want to wind them up because they are a waste of time. - The third principle was: there ought not to be a new `layer of control'. What was the policy result from their conference? It was: `We'll put a Commonwealth officer out in each of those regions.' I thought it was our job to represent the government in those regions. But, no, Labor are going to put a Commonwealth officer out there to do it - a new layer of control; Canberra's man in each region to ensure that the locals do not get any of their own ideas about where they might take their local communities. Every regional Australian should know that Labor do not believe in partnerships for regional growth. What they can know is that the nanny state is very much central to their thinking. It is not just going to be the reading police or the fat police -  - and the homework police; we now find that we are going to have regional development police. The nanny state is going to tell regional communities how to grow and develop their futures. That is not our way. The government has spent 8½ years developing a partnership approach to regional growth, which is very successful and which is deeply appreciated in the regions. I just trust that regional people are again going to have a bit of a look at where the ALP is coming from on all this stuff, because the Labor Party does not believe at all in local community solutions to local problems. </DOC>

 - I can certainly assure the member for Fraser that they will meet the guidelines that he was pleased to support when he was last a minister. In relation to future government advertising, we will explain government policies where it is necessary. We make absolutely no apology for that. I remind the member for Fraser that the great bulk of the expenditure on government advertising is in areas that I do not think anybody could take exception to - things like Defence Force recruiting, New Apprenticeships, a national tobacco campaign, violence against women and many other campaigns which are part and parcel. The truth of the matter is that all governments - and if the opposition could pause for a moment and put down their confected indignation and rage - from time to time have advertised and explained the features of new policies. What this government is doing is no different from what has been done in the past. Those who sit opposite know that well, and they proclaim their humbug and their hypocrisy by suggesting otherwise.</DOC>

I can inform the House that today I launched Health 2004. It is Australia's national health report card, which is produced by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. It showed good news: Australia's life expectancy is high and rising, our death rates from diseases such as cancer and heart disease are falling, our smoking rate is falling, suicide rates are falling, the vaccination rate is rising and our health work force is growing. This is all good news, and it testifies to the fact that our system, while not perfect, is as good as any health system in the world. With results like that, why would anyone want to mess with Medicare? Who would want to mess with Medicare? I can tell you who wants to mess with Medicare. It is the member for Lalor.  - She is so used to the rhetoric of crisis that she has become completely blind to the strengths of our existing system. - The member for Lalor's problem is that she has become so used to the exaggerated rhetoric of crisis that she is completely blind to the strengths of our existing Medicare system, particularly those parts of the system for which the federal government has sole responsibility. When I pointed out yesterday that what the member for Lalor wants to do is to reform Medicare as we know it out of existence and replace it with something more like the UK National Health Service, she got very indignant and took a personal explanation, and she is going to take another one now. To pre-empt it, let me read from the National Press Club speech that the member for Lalor tabled yesterday. - The member for Lalor says she does not support pooled funding. Let me read from her speech to the National Press Club. She says:... clearly the central idea of the Medicare Alliance - pooled funds to end cost shifting - remains as relevant today as when it was first publicly discussed in July 2000.But in a speech to the Australian Medical Association of Tasmania just last month, she went much further. She said:The principal characteristic of a unified national health system is that existing Commonwealth health monies - listen to this - (Medicare and PBS, payments to nursing homes, and Health Care Agreement) are combined with existing State and Territory health monies ... and the combined pool ... is then applied to the population's health needs.She could hardly have been more clear. What the member for Lalor wants to do is to create a $60 billion bureaucratic behemoth that would be accountable to no-one and elected by no-one. Under Labor's brave new world of health care, the three biggest dinosaurs would be the Russian army, the Indian railways and the Australian national health commission. That is what they want to create. Let me put a very clear challenge to the member for Lalor: if she does not believe in pooled health funding, why on earth did she talk about it - and not once, not twice, but repeatedly - over the last six months; and if she does believe in pooled health funding, what on earth does she really mean?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. Behind this question is an entire caucus of Labor members who have prompted the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to ask the question for one reason and one reason only, and that is that the Australian Labor Party is deeply resentful of parents who make enormous sacrifices to send their children -  -  - to Catholic, independent and a whole range of non-government schools throughout Australia - 2,652 schools. I made a decision when I took this job that I would not ever embark on the process of naming members of the House as to where they send their children to school, and I will not embarrass members of the Labor frontbench by doing that now. I will say a number of things in relation to this question. The question is intended to make the everyday Australian believe two things -  - The first falsehood which is inherent in the question is to make the average Australian falsely believe that those 1,320 boys at the King's School in Sydney in some way are receiving more public money in support of their education than any child at a government school, when in fact -  - The member for Kingsford Smith says that is right. That reflects either his ignorance or his determination to mislead the parliament. Those boys at the King's School receive around $2,500 of public money in support of their education. Were they to go to Fairvale High School in Sydney or any public secondary school in the state of New South Wales they would receive not $2,500 but $11,710 in support of their education.The second falsehood in the question from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is to make Australians think that capital works money has gone from this government into assisting in the building and construction of that facility. In fact no capital works money has come from the public purse to support the construction of that facility at the King's School. Do you know how it was funded? It was funded - as is almost all of the capital works for Catholic, independent, low-fee or high-fee schools - by cake stalls and raffles and by the sacrifices of parents.  -  - Let the Hansard record that Labor Party members are mocking sacrifices -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker, for requiring Labor members to cease their mocking of parental sacrifice. - All Australians should understand this: every time that a non-government school embarks on a capital works program it is funded by parents - who make enormous sacrifices and do fundraising or take on a third or sometimes a fourth job - or it is funded by schools going into debt. They borrow millions of dollars to undertake capital works programs.High-fee schools like the King's School do not get any capital works funding from this government. The capital works money goes into the low-fee schools. In fact, this year this government - just so you know - will provide $117 per child in capital works funding for children in government state schools, $116 for each child in a Catholic school and $76 dollars per child for capital works in independent schools, and none of it at the high-fee end. I also say to Australians - and particularly Labor members - that every child who attends a non-government school in this country receives less public money in support of their education than they would if they attended a government state school. The kids from the poorest families get 30 per cent less and the kids from the wealthiest families get 87 per cent less.By way of conclusion, I advise the House that the Independent Education Union, South Australian branch, in a letter to the Australian Education Union on 29 March this year, said:I see the AEU's concentration on federal government funding which is primarily applied to non-government schools and ignoring the state government funding which primarily funds government schools as a deliberate and dishonest attempt to distort the true interpretation of the data ...The writer went on to say:I call on the AEU - and I call on the Labor Party - to publicly acknowledge the fact that all non-government schools (especially the much maligned `elite' schools) receive combined state and federal government funding at levels lower (often significantly lower) than government schools.The Labor Party wants to worry about percentages. Where is the letter that I put here last week on the 300 per cent TAFE fee increases in New South Wales? Put your signature to that and then we will start listening.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Indi for her question. I know how important a healthy Murray River is to all the communities in her electorate. The Howard government is committed to making the Murray River a healthy, working river. To begin that task we have committed to an agreement with the states to put some $500 million towards purchasing and acquiring - through improvements on farm and otherwise - some 500 gigalitres of water for the river in order to restore some six icon sites for the Murray. Progressing that agreement began with the Living Murray agreement. The meeting of COAG on Friday to establish final agreement, we hope, to the national water initiative will be absolutely critical to ensuring that that water can return to the Murray River and can restore environmental health to those critical icon sites. Many interests and many communities are dependent on a healthy river, and the stakes of the meeting on Friday are high. No-one wants to see the states prevaricating further and trying to put off final decisions.I was asked by the member for Indi whether there are any alternative policies on this important issue. It would seem that Latham Labor has been making noises about a policy for the Murray River. Indeed we have seen some figures being quoted by the Labor Party, but when it comes to figures, as we know, the opposition is a master of either the fib or the fudge. When we look closely at these figures we find that there is a certain instability about them. - Volatility - I am corrected on a technical matter - in these figures is evident in what the Labor Party have to say. The first time we heard about the slush fund it was $150 million, well short of the amount that would have been required to purchase the environmental flows the Labor Party claimed they wanted. On 27 May, about four weeks ago, the Leader of the Opposition reinforced his commitment to this $150 million river bank slush fund. Less than four weeks later we turn to the Labor Party's web site - the most airbrushed web site in Australia - and we read on this web site that they would inject 450 gigalitres of water into the Murray in their first term of government, through their $350 million river bank fund. So $200 million has suddenly appeared on the web site but it has not been acknowledged in any press release. - It was only $150 million and now it has gone up to $350 million - another $200 million has suddenly appeared on the river bank. This is a 133 per cent increase in a month - that is a bigger increase than the rent return from Centenary House. It is the magic pudding - they have turned it around a couple of times and suddenly it has coughed up another $200 million. They say, `$150 million wasn't enough, so let's add on another $200 million, but let's not tell anybody where this $200 million is coming from.' With this web site you never know: is this new money, is it paid for, is it dissembling, is it a mistake, is it fibbing, is it fudging or is it just incompetence? You cannot trust Labor on money - $10 billion worth of promises, $11 billion worth of tax cuts, money left over for an intergenerational fund, and another $200 million suddenly pops out on the Google web site. When is the Leader of the Opposition going to tell us how he is going to fund this incredible list of promises? </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cunningham for his question. I appreciate that, like many members in this House, he is interested in where Medicare funded MRI machines might go. I can assure the member for Cunningham and other members of the House that access to MRI has increased dramatically under this government, from 18 machines back in the late 1990s to 73 Medicare funded machines today. MRI funding has gone up from $20 million a year in the late 1990s to $105 million a year now. My department has set up an advisory committee composed of the profession, the providers, the clinicians and the consumers. That committee will be looking at proposed guidelines for the appropriate placement of new Medicare funded MRI machines. Those guidelines will be announced shortly and expressions of interest will be called for shortly.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flinders for his question. I admire his recent walk around his electorate - some 500 hours, I understand. The government has announced today a record sum of $31½ billion of funding and investment in schools over the next four years. For the first time, however, the government is requiring that all government and non-government schools that receive funding from the Australian government meet fundamental conditions. The government is concerned to see that there is national consistency in school education; that by 2010 we will for the first time have a common starting age in schooling throughout Australia and that there will be common testing in key areas of reading, writing, numeracy, science, ICT, civics and democracy. At the school level it is essential that information be made available to parents. The government wants to make sure schools report to parents on literacy and numeracy performance at the school level; on the average year 12 result delivered in the secondary school; on the qualifications, ongoing training and absenteeism rate of teachers, which is very important in education; and also on the attendance rates of students.The government is also setting in the legislation a requirement that schools report to parents in plain language, in terms that they can actually understand. In the year 2000, my predecessor the member for Goldstein commissioned some research on this. Professor Peter Cuttance's research reported that parents said:If the child is failing, they want it said on [the report]. They don't want some politically correct thing on there. [Parents] want to know in black and white [how their children are achieving].So, for example, the government will require performance in school reports to give us as parents some idea of where our kids are going compared to the rest of the class. When we get a school report that ticks a box that says `achieving' or `almost achieving', we think, `What on earth does that mean?' When the member for Flinders is walking around his electorate, if his wife rings up the organisers and says, `Where is he?' and they say, `He is almost achieving,' she would say, `What on earth does that mean? Does that mean he is at Somerville or has he just got past Arthurs Seat?' It also means absolutely nothing to parents, so the government is determined to use the leverage of $31 billion to drive national consistency in standards and national consistency in starting ages, and to make sure that real information about school performance is available to parents so that they can start to make meaningful judgments about where they send their children. That includes having at least two hours of exercise made available through the school on a weekly basis and ensuring that values in education inform everything that is delivered in every school in the country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question and for the continued and persistent advocacy for small business in his electorate. I can report to members in the House that the levels of industrial disputes in Australia are still at historic lows. Indeed, in the March 2004 quarter there were 9.3 working days lost per 1,000 employees. This compares with the dark days of industrial disputation under the Labor Party, when the level reached 104.6 working days lost per 1,000 employees. That is 9.3 in the March quarter of this year under the coalition government, compared to a height of 104.6 under the previous Labor administration - 11 times the number of industrial disputes under the Labor Party compared to the level that it is in the March quarter of this year. There are still some concerns, particularly in relation to Western Australia and Victoria, areas in which mayhem in the construction industry in particular has led to increased disputation - something which this government is determined to fix.However, what these figures reveal, once again, is that the reform of the workplace relations system in Australia has meant that Australian workers not only are receiving higher wages but have more jobs and work in conditions of less industrial disputation than they did in the past. This is because of reforms which this government has put in place to enhance the relationship between employers and employees in being able to deal directly with each other. For example, something which the member for Dunkley has been a great promoter of is the offering of Australian workplace agreements, which have given choice and flexibility to both employers and employees. We are nearing the mark where half a million Australian workplace agreements will have been entered into since they were introduced under this government. I am asked about whether there are any dangers to these achievements, and there clearly are. They come from the proposals which are being advocated on behalf of the Australian Labor Party by the member for Werriwa. What we have here is an antibusiness plan from the Australian Labor Party. We heard questions earlier in question time from the member for Werriwa about small business. Let me tell you what the Labor Party have planned in part for small business and what they will do in terms of industrial disputation. For example, the Australian Labor Party wish to remove the secondary boycott provisions from the Trade Practices Act so that the industry-wide wildcat strikes that were commonplace under the previous Labor Party would become a feature again of the workplace scenario in Australia. The Australian Labor Party, under the member for Werriwa, want to abolish the Australian workplace agreements - almost 500,000 - which have been entered into between employees and employers. The Australian Labor Party, under the Leader of the Opposition, wish to increase the power of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which would lead to more industrial disputation, which would have an adverse impact upon small business. On top of that, we have these crazy proposals from the Australian Labor Party to give union bosses and their representatives the power to walk into every business in Australia, whether or not those businesses happen to employ union members.There is a clear distinction, so far as Australian workplaces are concerned, both on the historical record in terms of industrial disputation and in the way in which the coalition wishes to go forward with more choice and flexibility in the workplace, compared with the Australian Labor Party, whose regressive plans to massively reregulate the workplace in Australia would increase industrial disputation, cost jobs and hurt ordinary Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for asking a very important question about a very important area of public policy, and that is the health system of this country. As the member for Hume knows, everybody on the government side is absolutely and unconditionally committed to the future strength and sustainability of Australia's Medicare system. We are also very strongly committed to the contribution that private health can make to overall health provision in this country.As the entire House knows, yesterday there was a very welcome change of heart by the Australian Labor Party. It has been uncharacteristically described as a backflip in this morning's press, but let me say that I welcome the decision that was taken by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday. It represents the first small step for the Leader of the Opposition towards a more credible economic policy. But I want the Leader of the Opposition to go further. So to borrow a phrase: will Labor now join the government and support the much-needed reforms to the disability support pension system? There was a time when I would not have thought that question was necessary, because somebody once said: Something also needs to be done about the outrageous growth in the Disability Support Pension (DSP), which is now paid to more than 550,000 Australians. It is being used as a way of shifting people off the dole and artificially lowering the unemployment rate. Some experts believe the size of the program should be no more than 150,000.Incredibly, one in every 13 Australians aged between 40 and 65 has been classified as disabled and given the DSP. ...	...	...The DSP needs to be overhauled and mutual responsibility policies applied to all those with a genuine capacity for work.They were the words of the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa, in a paper entitled - listen to this - `The welfare state and the third way'. It was a speech given to the Brisbane Institute on 26 July 1999. Put rather more directly, he had this to say in the Sydney Daily Telegraph on 18 August 2000:For 30 years politicians have been talking about the need to treat people with disabilities as active participants in our society. The time has come to act on this sweet-sounding rhetoric.Let me say it again: the time has come for Labor to join the government and to act on this sweet-sounding rhetoric.But I do not think we should limit the reform horizon to the disability support pension. I might ask rhetorically: will Labor now join the government and support reforms to Australia's unfair dismissal laws? Will Labor now join the government and commit to maintaining Australian workplace agreements? Will Labor now join the government and commit unconditionally to retaining the private health insurance rebate? That is a fairly simple one. The Leader of the Opposition could get up and say, `I unconditionally commit my party, if it wins government, to maintain in full, without variation, the existing taxation arrangements.' If he does that, that will be a second small step towards a credible position.I ask in the context of current discussions: will Labor now join the government and support the passage of the free trade agreement with the United States? Importantly and very urgently, will Labor finally produce a costed economic policy and particularly a taxation policy? The Leader of the Opposition was talking in his first question about debates on policy. I might ask the question: how can you debate a bloke about policy when he does not have one? How can you seriously have a debate about policy when he does not have one? The Leader of the Opposition has had the job for six months. I will not let him in on the secret as to how long it will be before he is tested before the bar of public opinion in Australia, but I will give him this bit of advice: to be taken seriously you have to produce a credible alternative. Although one small step was taken yesterday, he is a long way from doing that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question. The Australian government and I am sure all members of the House condemn the brutal slaying of a South Korean citizen, the civilian translator Mr Kim Sun-il. Nothing can justify such an unspeakable evil. This morning I asked the South Korean Ambassador to come and see me and I took the opportunity during our meeting to extend Australia's profound sympathies to Mr Kim's family and also, more broadly, the Australian people's sympathies to the people of the Republic of Korea. I also told the ambassador that I warmly welcome President Roh's commitment to continue with South Korea's deployment of troops to the northern part of Iraq. Their plan is to deploy a little over 3,000 troops by the end of August. I told the ambassador that I admired President Roh and his government's steely commitment to deal with terrorism in a very determined way and the fact that the Korean government has made it clear that it will not bow to the demands of terrorists.The perpetrators of this appalling act are believed to be from the same group led by the al-Qaeda linked terrorist al-Zarqawi. It was that group which murdered the American civilian Nicholas Berg back in May. The horror of these acts shows that al-Zarqawi and his cohorts live in a moral vacuum. They have no connection with humanity and they have no connection with civilisation. They offer no hope; they only offer anarchy and suffering for the Iraqi people. We will not abandon the Iraqi people and leave them in the hands of these savages. In the face of such vile acts the international community, including Australia, must not weaken its resolve. We must all be prepared to stay the course. It is a grave mistake to think that in any way at all it is possible to appease terrorists. In weakness, they will see opportunity; from lack of resolve, the terrorists will draw confidence.I note the comments by the Philippines Foreign Secretary - and many members of the House will know her - Delia Albert, who was the long-serving Philippines Ambassador in Canberra, in her capacity as the United Nations Security Council president. She said:In the face of such evil, the world must stand united against the scourge of international terrorism that continues to plague our global community. On behalf of the members of the Security Council, I wish to condemn in the strongest of terms this abominable act of terrorism against an innocent civilian.I can only say, `Hear, hear!' to the words of the Foreign Secretary of the Philippines. The government admire the resolve and the strength shown by the government of Korea and we will always show the same resolve and strength ourselves.</DOC>

 - Let me point out to the Leader of the Opposition that this government has a very good record on vaccination. Vaccination rates amongst children have gone up from just 50 per cent in the early 1990s to over 90 per cent now. Federal spending on vaccines has gone up from $13 million in 1996 to $143 million this year. That is even before the nearly $180 million which the government is about to spend on pneumococcal vaccines.This government has an extremely good record on vaccination. As for the chickenpox vaccination that the Leader of the Opposition raises, subsequent to the recommendation of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, I have been advised by the Chief Medical Officer of the Commonwealth that new technical information has come to hand. On the basis of the new technical information, the Chief Medical Officer has asked ATAGI to reconsider its recommendation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Petrie for her question. Tomorrow the government will be introducing legislation based on the report of Sir Daryl Dawson and his review of the Trade Practices Act. The bill will be introduced because it has fulfilled the requirements under the intergovernmental agreement. We have consulted for three months and, after the consultation period closes, a bill is then drawn, the bill is then put to the states for votes, the states have 35 days in which to vote and at least two states have to vote in favour of it. All states either have voted in favour or are taken to have voted in favour of this bill, and it will be introduced tomorrow.Important reforms that will be put in place under this bill include a new formal mechanism for mergers. They also include increased penalties for breach of competition provisions, where the fines can be a maximum of $10 million or three times the value of the benefit or, where the value cannot be determined, 10 per cent of annual turnover. In addition to that, the bill will provide a new mechanism for small business to engage in collective bargaining. Under the new mechanism, small businesses, where they have transactions of $3 million per annum with the one person, can give notice to the ACCC that they intend to collectively bargain and, if the ACCC does not object, they are taken to have the power to do so - unlike the current situation where small business must seek authorisation in advance, pay a fee and go through an authorisation process. These provisions will be of benefit to motor vehicle repairers, petrol station owners, agricultural businesses and many other small businesses around Australia.In addition to that, we will be tabling in both houses this afternoon the government's response to the Senate joint committee in relation to the Trade Practices Act, in particular section 46 of the Trade Practices Act. The response will indicate that the government proposes to accept the minority report - that is, the report of the government members. They made sensible recommendations as to how the operation of section 46 could be improved - by, for example, empowering the courts to look at the question of where a business has both the capacity to cost below price - and does so - and a reasonable prospect or expectation of recouping losses from such below-cost pricing. That is not to say that the court cannot look at those matters at the moment, but it is to say that, by putting it specifically in the statute, it will be clear that the courts can direct their attention to that, and that would mean that making out the offence of misuse of market power or predatory pricing would be assisted in that way. These are important reforms. They balance the need to have a competitive economy. They balance the requirements of a free market and open trading system. They give improved rights to small business in relation to collective bargaining. They make it clear that the government will not tolerate anticompetitive conduct. Together, these reforms will be of assistance. Our response to the Senate will have to go through the consultation period of three months, the preparation of a bill and the 35-day voting period, and that will take some time. The bill to be introduced tomorrow has important changes. I call on the House to support that bill.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. I acknowledge his interest in this subject, particularly in his position as the chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. I also acknowledge that this morning the member for Boothby tabled the JSCOT report on the Australia-US free trade agreement - and quite a comprehensive report it was too.Obviously, as trade minister, I am always interested in community attitudes towards trade as it affects the Australian economy and the Australian people. It was interesting that in late May Newspoll conducted a survey and asked a range of questions about community attitudes towards trade and what the community thought the effect of trade was on our economy. Some of the results were quite compelling: 62 per cent of the people surveyed believed that trade was good for the local economy; 61 per cent believed that trade created jobs; 93 per cent believed that trade was important for rural and regional Australia; and - interestingly, with the debate being undertaken at the moment - the Newspoll survey also asked about Australia's free trade agreements and 60 per cent of people surveyed supported the Australia-United States free trade agreement. A clear majority of those surveyed supported what the government has done in the negotiation with the United States. The respondents identified the main benefits of the United States free trade agreement as being more jobs, increased exports, access to US markets and economic growth. With that level of support from the community and the growing level of support from amongst the ranks of his own party, it is still a wonder that the Leader of the Opposition will not commit to supporting the free trade agreement in the Senate as well as in the House of Representatives. Labor have said that they will not oppose the FTA in the House but they reserve the right to oppose it in the Senate. I seem to recall the last Labor Prime Minister of this country had a particular description that he used to use on odd occasions about the Senate. I wonder what he thinks about devolving authority on such an important issue to the Senate.But it begs the question about leadership. You have six Labor state premiers - all leading their governments and their states - supporting this agreement. They know it is the right thing for their states and that it is going to be beneficial to their economies. Collectively they know that it is also good for Australia - in the national interest. It is to be hoped that they, along with the member for Corio, will convince the Leader of the Opposition that they should support this legislation when it goes to the Senate. The member for Corio yesterday made his position very clear to the National Farmers Federation, and I table the transcript of some answers he gave to questions yesterday where he gave his support to the FTA going through the House. There is no question - the community knows it; the state Labor premiers know it; the member for Corio knows it - that this is a good deal for Australia. We in the government obviously know it. It is now in the national interest that the Labor Party in the House and the Senate support this deal.</DOC>

 - My office has followed, to the best of my understanding, on this issue the DFAT practices in terms of ONA documents. If you are referring to an issue that you appear to have a curious preoccupation with - the fact that Andrew Bolt apparently was given a copy of this report - to the best of my knowledge there has been a police investigation into that. The police have had the opportunity to talk to people in my office. No doubt, if anything untoward happened there, they would have dealt with it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question. - The member for Blair asked me whether there had been developments which will assist in getting the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme on a financially sustainable basis. There have been such developments. There was a rather stunning development yesterday which will assist in getting the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme on a financially sustainable basis. Yesterday, after 25 months, the Australian Labor Party decided that it would support a measure, to increase copayments for concession holders to $4.60 and for non-concession holders to a maximum of $28.60, from memory, which was introduced not in this year's budget, not in last year's budget, but in the budget brought down on 14 May 2002.Interestingly enough, this was announced by the member for Fraser. Although it was a health measure, it was announced by the member for Fraser, which may well give you an idea as to why it was announced. When he was doing an interview about the subject yesterday, he was asked this question: `It's a massive backflip, isn't it, Bob?' His answer was:No, it's just a hard decision that any sensible, responsible economic manager would ... make.On this side, I guess we would agree that any sensible, responsible economic manager would have to make that decision. So, if any responsible economic manager would have to make it, why didn't Labor make it for 25 months?It took me back to another transcript of the member for Fraser - a transcript of a doorstop on 9 October 2002. Bear in mind that any responsible economic manager would have made that decision. Back in October 2002 this is what the member for Fraser had to say about the matter:They have put up the price of essential medicines by 30 per cent and it costs $300 million. We won't be supporting these increases in the price of essential medicine - not now, not ever. Never, ever! In October 2002 he said `not now, not ever'. I may have missed it, but was there an election between October 2002 and May 2004? I may well have missed it. Not now, not ever, he said. This raises the question: which of Labor's other policies - not now, not ever - could well change overnight? Now that the Leader of the Opposition is in his Greg Louganis mood, with the triple backflips, which other policies could change? The Prime Minister has also adverted to one of them. It is Labor's policy on the disability support pension. Let me ask the question: does Labor still oppose the government's proposal to reform the disability support pension? We know that there is one member of the Labor Party that wants to support the government on disability support, because the member for Werriwa actually called on us to do it. But he has been joined by another member today - the member for Chifley.  -  - My goodness! They started airbrushing their transcripts and now they airbrush their members. They have airbrushed him out of his seat. I could have sworn he was up there somewhere. Get the Labor Party web site up before they change it and get the members' handbook before they take his picture out of it. The member for Chifley was asked this on his way into the parliament today:  JOURNALIST - How is this going to go down in Western Sydney - your neck of the woods? PRICE - I think people understand John Howard hurts people who can least bear the burden.JOURNALIST - It is a cop-out to say that, when you're the one that's supporting it, isn't it? PRICE - To be frank, I have always had reservations about holding up the legislation.JOURNALIST - What about the disability services pension then? Obviously there would be apprehension in holding that up as well?PRICE - Look, they want to make a lot of changes.JOURNALIST - Do you challenge Mark to support that now as well though?PRICE - Well, look, I think we should look at everything that we have held back in the past. I mean, personally, and it is only my view, governments should be able to govern. -  - We call on the New South Wales right to release Roger immediately. Let him loose from Sussex Street and let him come back down here and let him sit on this side of the parliament. Disability support pension was a never, ever. Pharmaceutical benefits was a never, ever. There has been a triple double backflip in relation to pharmaceuticals. What about doing the same here? What about listening to Roger? What about letting a government get on and govern? To that, we say amen.</DOC>

 - I genuinely thank the honourable member for his question. On the documents available to me, in early July in the year 2000, before I became minister, officials in the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources sent an email to a consultant they had in place in Adelaide, asking whether or not a press conference should be held using a number of experts and technical people. Bear in mind this is after research that showed that the people of South Australia wanted facts. They were sick of the political argy-bargy and they actually wanted to make up their own mind about the worth or necessity of a repository. I am further advised by my department that that press conference never went ahead. So the suggestion of making available technical experts -  -  - Roger has been produced! -  - I am hoping that the member for Chifley's commonsense and balance can be brought to bear on the issue of the need for a national repository in South Australia and that science and logic will prevail. To conclude my comments, I am further advised that that press conference never went ahead, that the people who have spoken on a technical basis in regard to this issue have been those obviously associated with the government.May I take this opportunity to remind the House that it is the Leader of the Opposition who has committed the Australian Labor Party to abandoning the selected site at Woomera for the national repository for low-level radioactive waste. After 13 years of both state and federal government involvement, based on scientific and technical advice, a site - having finally been selected - will now be abandoned, after 13 years and the expenditure of many millions of dollars, with no alternative in place. Consequently it is a totally irresponsible commitment by the Leader of the Opposition to make, because it places people's safety at risk. What we know is that in South Australia low-level radioactive waste is spread around 26 towns and suburbs, in hospital basements and university cupboards in 120 sites. That is South Australia. New South Wales cannot even give an inventory of where their low-level radioactive waste is temporarily and haphazardly stored, but you can presume it is in dozens, if not hundreds, of separate locations. We need a national repository which has been selected on all the regulatory and legislative requirements.The Sunday Age, which the Treasurer mentioned the other day, listed the 200 promises in 200 days. It listed under the portfolio of science the commitment by the Leader of the Opposition to abandon the waste dump in South Australia, but he was unable to say where it might go or the costings that would go with it. The opposition have no credibility on this. As long as they play base politics on this issue, people's safety is at risk.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question and recognise that he is a great advocate for small businesses in Townsville. When we met with them, they overwhelmingly endorsed his efforts to support local businesses. Obviously we are very concerned about the Labor Party's ongoing attacks on workplace relations and the relationship between employers and employees. Today the government have announced far-reaching changes to the Trade Practices Act that in effect are going to deliver through legislation the most substantial benefits to small business in over 30 years. In the specific area of section 46, the Treasurer announced that we are making changes in relation to predatory pricing. That gives real meaning to the provisions of section 46. Our changes make predatory pricing easier to prove. So large business is on notice that if it is engaging in predatory pricing against small business then section 46 and the ACCC, with additional resources, are going to get it. It is a warning in that situation.Perhaps even more significant are the new provisions being introduced to the parliament tomorrow in relation to collective bargaining. These provisions allow grape growers in Mallee to get together and work constructively in partnership with a potential purchaser, but if that does not work they will have the full power of the Trade Practices Act behind them. The member for Mallee has seen me about that. In the member for Deakin's electorate it could be smash repairers who have had difficulty in dealing with insurance companies. They are now able to get together and collectively bargain with insurance companies. In the member for Herbert's electorate it could be independent petrol stations who have been struggling to deal with their major suppliers. Now, under this provision introduced by the coalition government, independent petrol stations may well be able to get together and negotiate with the major supplier to get a better deal. In the member for Hinkler's electorate it could be car repairers who have had difficulty in dealing with spare parts manufacturers. They could get together under these provisions. In the member for McPherson's electorate, tenants in a shopping mall may be able to get together so that they can collectively bargain when they are dealing with a major entity that is running the shopping mall. It could be franchisees, it could be sugar farmers and it could be dairy farmers. These are landmark provisions that empower small business in a way that they have never been empowered before. They allow them to compete and negotiate with large business on an equal and fair basis. In no way will it compromise competition, because the ACCC has the power to disallow the application for collective bargaining if it is anticompetitive. We are evening up the playing field to give small business a leg-up and to do the right thing by 1.2 million businesses out there that are the engine room of the Australian economy. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. The question is about a number of things. It is about non-government schools offering opportunities for students who might not otherwise be able to afford to go to them to do so. It is also about the funding of non-government schools, including Catholic schools. There are a number of things that need to be said.The first is that, for every single child in a Catholic school or an independent school, every time a parent in this country decides to put their hand in their pocket for their kids to use after-tax dollars for their education, they are receiving less public money in support of their education than if they sent that same child to a public school. As the Prime Minister has said before, the 68 per cent of children in this country who attend government state schools receive not 68 per cent of the public money but 76 per cent, and the 32 per cent in the non-government -   - Those 1.1 million children attending Catholic and independent schools - that is 32 per cent of the kids in the system - are receiving 24 per cent of all of the public money. And that funding system - which the Labor Party voted for in 2001 and which it indicated yesterday it will be voting for again this year - has now been joined by the Catholic systemic schools. His Eminence Cardinal George Pell has made it very clear to Catholic families and the broader community, amongst others, that it is very important to focus on the federal and the state government funding.The Labor Party asks this question. By the way, I asked my department to do some work on this - on schools that offer scholarships to kids to give them a break. So, if their families are unable or unwilling to pay to get a certain education for them, what impact does a scholarship have? The impact that it has on the socioeconomic status core that determines the funding is less than 0.1 of a percentage point - when SES scores are from 80 to 130.The next point that needs to be addressed in this question is that the fellow travellers from the Australian Education Union are currently running ads on television. Many people in the gallery would have seen them. They put up Scots College, which offers scholarships, on one side of the television and then they have a public school, Glen Waverley Secondary College, on the other. The union invites Australians to ask themselves: why is the school on the left, Scots College, getting $3 million and why then is the school on the right, the Glen Waverley Secondary College, a public school, getting $1½ million dollars? So the average Australian - although the member for Chifley would not do this - would be going: `Well, that seems odd to me. Why is that private school getting more than a government school?'And that is because the union, like these people across the House, only tell half of the story. They tell a half-truth and try to mislead people. Scots College have 1,820 kids - Australian kids - and they get $3½ million in public funding. The Glen Waverley Secondary College has 1,870 Australian kids and gets $20 million in public funding. So what is going on here? There is a deceit in the question, a deceit in what is being told to the public, and I say to Australians and to young people in particular: always scratch away the surface and look for the truth, and you will never find it in questions from the other side.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question, because today there was a very important meeting here at the parliament building of some 40 of Australia's senior business leaders, who willingly gave of their time to meet and discuss the very important issues of national security. This forum was addressed by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and me. It also heard from the Director-General of ASIO and the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, as well as Richard Humphry from the Australian Stock Exchange. It was also attended by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources and my colleague the Minister for Justice and Customs. I thank them for attending and addressing this very important meeting. It was a unique and important opportunity to strengthen the partnership between business and government on the protection of Australia against terrorism.The government has been focused on the protection of critical infrastructure - our energy, transport, food supply, finance and manufacturing sectors and our national icons and other utilities. I know members on this side of the House are interested in national security issues and would be very much aware that the business leaders today focused on the threat posed by terrorism -  - and they also appreciated the recent budget initiatives, with $50.2 million over a four-year period committed to programs designed to protect critical infrastructure. - The key message from today was the need to build together on the good work that has already been done and to ensure the lines of communication between government and business remain open. But it cannot be done alone. The willingness of business to engage with government on these issues, to work in a genuine partnership, is particularly welcome. As a result of the discussions in which we were engaged today, the government has decided to establish a consultative group of senior business leaders whose companies or organisations are responsible for major infrastructure assets and who will play an important part in giving business leadership to the protection of those assets.The consultative group will provide a forum through which business can provide high-level advice and feedback on national security measures that relate to business, particularly focusing on critical infrastructure protection. It will provide a mechanism for Australian government to discuss proposed new security initiatives and developments as they occur from time to time. This new arrangement will complement the more specific ongoing medium-term strategic objectives of the existing Critical Infrastructure Advisory Council and the Trusted Information Sharing Network. We do face a significant threat to our personal security and safety, as a result of the activities of terrorists. I want to assure you, Mr Speaker, and I want to assure all members, that the government is determined to deal with that threat, and the outcome of today's forum demonstrates that determination. </DOC>

 - In making appointments, as always, the government will act properly. I will say no more than that. We always act properly in relation to appointments. While on my feet on this subject, I will say that over the years people who have held honoured positions in this parliament have gone on in later life to serve with distinction. I look across and I see the member for Barton. His father was one of the most distinguished high commissioners to the United Kingdom, as well as, of course, having very positive football loyalties.I simply say to the member for Prospect that we will act properly in relation to these matters. Before I became Prime Minister, I did not rule out the appointment of people who had served in this parliament. I might remind the member for Prospect that, when I became Prime Minister, the High Commissioner to the United Kingdom was Neal Blewett, a former health minister in the previous government. He was not asked to come home earlier than had been the arrangement. He was allowed to continue his term. I think one of the very good appointments this government made was that of the former Leader of the Opposition and former distinguished foreign minister, Mr Andrew Peacock, as Ambassador to the United States. The former member for Curtin served as Consul General in Los Angeles. I think the appointments this government has made have been proper, and they will continue to be proper.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question because it allows me to clearly restate the policy of this government - that is, don't mess with Medicare. That is the policy of this government. By contrast, yesterday's historic backflip on the PBS demonstrates that Labor's health policy is nothing but a confused muddle. The member for Lalor denies that she has a secret plan to establish something like the UK National Health Service, but she keeps talking about abolishing all existing health programs and putting the money into one big pool to be administered on the basis of `the bureaucratic knows best'. She talked about pooled funding to the National Press Club. She talked about pooled funding to the national conference of the AMA. She talked about pooled funding to the Tasmanian conference of the AMA, where she said, `Let's get rid of Medicare, the PBS, payments to nursing homes and the health care agreement. Let's combine all the state and territory moneys in a pool.' Then she said:This would effectively end the destructive cost shifting and mean that targeted programs could be introduced for individual regions.In talking about pooled funding, the member for Lalor is just listening to her master's voice. The Leader of the Opposition himself, writing in the Daily Telegraph on 25 June 1999, said that the biggest health challenge now facing governments is `how to bring the private sector and the public sector into a single national health program'. But he did not stop there. On the Sunday Sunrise program on 6 August 2000, the member for Werriwa said: The idea of pooling the federal and state health funds is outstanding.What Labor now need to explain is just how this outstanding idea might work. Would the opposition put all of the $8 billion in the Medicare Benefits Schedule into the pool? Would that mean that every doctor had to work as a subcontractor to the area health authority? Would that mean that people could visit only their bureaucratically designated doctor? Absolutely - yes, it would. - Then explain exactly what it would mean! Would the whole of the $5 billion of the PBS be put into the pool? Does that mean that prescriptions would be rationed and you could get them only from the government approved dispensary? The member for Lalor says that there are already pooled funds operating in Indigenous communities. Does she really think that health services in Chatswood and Malvern should operate on the same basis as health services in Aurukun and Hermannsburg? Is that what she really thinks? - Then explain exactly what you do think! Go on Laurie Oakes's program and explain! - It is really high time that the Labor Party came clean about their health policy. They go on these interviews and keep prattling on about Labor's plan to save Medicare. I tell you what: they have plagiarised their health policy from Apocalypse Now. Their health policy is that you have to destroy Medicare in order to save Medicare. That is their health policy. They have to come clean with the Australian people because, until they do, the message is going out that, when it comes to health policy, you cannot trust Labor.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Rankin for his question. It gives me the opportunity of pointing out to the House -  - It gives me the opportunity to answer the member for Rankin and say to other members in the House that what the government proposes in relation to small business is precisely what employees in this country already have. In fact, what we have in this country under the industrial relations system is an awards system and an agreement system. Employees can collectively bargain either through their unions or under non-union certified agreements, which are a form of collective bargaining.If the member for Rankin is advocating the system which is being introduced for small business as an exemplar then he would reverse the policy of the Labor Party to abolish Australian workplace agreements. What the member for Rankin is saying is that it is all right for small business to be able to collectively bargain and to bargain individually, but that is not good enough for Australian workers. What hypocrisy from the Labor Party! Here is a party that says that it is okay for small business to be able to collectively bargain and it is okay for small business to be able to enter into individual agreements, but, when it comes to the workers of Australia, they are not allowed to enter into the individual agreements of Australian workplace relations. The reality is that, for both small business and employees, we are saying that they can have the choice of collectively bargaining or having individual arrangements, which is something that the Labor Party will not support. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Casey for his question, which I found difficult to hear because of the laughter about flags from the Labor Party. Yesterday the Australian government announced that, over the next four years, $31.3 billion of taxpayers' hard-earned money will be invested in school education. That is a record investment in schooling. But, for the first time, the Australian government is requiring that certain conditions are met in national standards; accountability to parents; reporting information; clear reports back to parents in plain language about the progress of our children; making sure that values are embedded in education in government and non-government schools; making sure that every school has a well-developed safety program for schooling; and, amongst many other things, making sure that every school in this country that receives money from the Australian government has a functioning flagpole and flies the Australian flag.Backbenchers achieve an enormous amount in this parliament, particularly on this side. The member for Casey, halfway through 2002, came to me and said, `We have a problem with some of the schools in my electorate. Some of the schools I've been to don't have a flagpole.' So having raised it at a civics and democracy conference, I then wrote to every state minister for education in this country and suggested that it was important that every government school have a functioning flagpole and, if they did not have one, then the Australian government would be prepared to provide one financially. In fact, I understand that Croydon Public School in the electorate of Casey was the first school in Australia to benefit from this program, which provides up to $1,500 to get a flagpole in an Australian school. I have been asked about the reaction to this announcement yesterday. There is a lot, but I will just walk the House through some of it. In the Australian newspaper this morning it says:Every morning without fail, Philip Meehan unfolds the red, white and blue of the Australian flag with great care, ensuring its edges never touch the ground.Philip is an 11-year-old student at Swanbourne Primary School in the electorate of Curtin, I think. Labor members ought to hear what 11-year-old children have to say. He said:To me it says Australia - our country, our home ... It's an honour and a privilege to be in this country and to have such a brilliant flag and brilliant people here. His principal, Nola Holt, said: Because we have become a very multicultural society and people come from all different countries, I really think we need to have one flag the children identify themselves with as being Australians. Unfortunately, not all of the commentary was as reflective of mainstream society views as that. For example, when I opened the Herald Sun this morning it said:But education spokeswoman Jenny Macklin blasted the new flags-attached funding conditions.Then I found in the West Australian newspaper that State School Teachers Union president Mike Keely said that Mr Howard and education minister Brendan Nelson had taken tokenism to the extreme. That is the view of Australia's education union. In fact, its federal president, Pat Byrne, in the Melbourne Age said:It's a preoccupation with appearances ...So, as far as the Labor Party and its fellow travellers and trashers are concerned, this is trivial. According to the Australian Education Union Victorian branch president Mary Blewett, the flag plan was `a nonsense'. So, according to their fellow travellers, it is a nonsense. According to them, it is a preoccupation with appearances. The Labor Party and the unions better start listening to people like the principal of the Haberfield Public School, Karlyanne Jacobsen. The Sydney Morning Herald this morning reports:The flag flying above Haberfield Public School and the patriotism practised below are glue to the 640 students who line up every Monday morning.The principal of the 'very multicultural' school ... said that saluting the flag, singing the national anthem and repeating mottos of respect and honour were 'really part of us uniting'.This is one part of a four-year program for national consistency and standards of education. It is about honouring our past, imbuing in children an understanding of the values and sacrifices of people who made this country what it is, as we think about our future and where we want to go.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wills for his question. I take it that the web site has been corrected in relation to Riverbank - that the $200 million has disappeared off the web site by now. That was not the case just before question time. I think it is important that the Labor Party be honest in what it tells the Australian people through its web site. I am aware of the recent decision of the Douglas Shire Council. It took that decision as a result of local planning laws. I understand that under Queensland legislation it has the responsibility for providing funding to any land-holders whose property enjoinment rights may be affected by changes in those planning laws. The question that the member for Wills has asked me, however, gives me the opportunity to say that the Australian government has contributed some $60 million to the management of the wet tropics World Heritage area and region. That has included some $12 million to the Daintree rescue package for the purposes of purchasing land and providing infrastructure to the Daintree area. In fact, we have also given $1 million to the Australian Rainforest Foundation to purchase areas of land with high conservation values and on-sell them to private sponsors. I welcome the commitment of the Douglas Shire Council to the preservation of the World Heritage areas of the Daintree. We certainly support that. I am not aware of any analysis that has been done of any flow-on implications of their own local responsibilities. But if the Douglas Shire Council care to approach the Commonwealth on this matter we would obviously consider any flow-on impacts to the World Heritage area.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question and for his interest because, as he would know only too well, the vast majority of countries in Asia value very much their relationship with the United States and have a close relationship with that country. They have regular military training exercises. They have counter-terrorism cooperation - indeed, to such an extent that their counter-terrorism cooperation has led to the arrest of Hambali and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. Regional support for the Proliferation Security Initiative is growing. Japan and Singapore are core members. New Zealand and Thailand are participating in meetings on the PSI. Importantly, Japan supports the missile defence initiative. Defence Minister Ishiba said at the end of last year, `Missile defence is indispensable for Japan's security.'Significantly, many countries in Asia have troops in Iraq supporting the Iraqi people and the coalition more generally - Japan has over 500; South Korea has 660 and is proposing to send a further 3,000; and Mongolia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand all have troops. This explodes the myth which is propagated in par-ticular by the opposition and some of their supporters that having involvement in Iraq damages us in Asia and having close relations with the United States damages us in Asia. Indeed, what is interesting is that countries in Asia are interested in a free trade agreement with the United States. Singapore has a free trade agreement with the United States. Negotiations with Thailand are to start. Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Brunei all have trade and investment facilitation agreements with the United States. The Labor Party believe that you cannot have close relations with the United States and close relations with Asia. The Labor Party believe that the two are mutually contradictory. As a result, Labor argue that we should downgrade our relationship with the United States. We know that the Labor Party want to pull the troops out of Iraq. They reject the United States' right to defend its people from ballistic missile attack, by opposing the missile defence initiative. They are opposed, apparently, to the Proliferation Security Initiative, even though 60 countries support it. And when it comes to the free trade agreement with the United States, the Labor Party rejected that at the outset. Let us remember what the Leader of the Opposition said:If we were asked to vote on it today, or in the parliament tomorrow, we would be opposing it.And since then the Labor Party have constantly attacked the free trade agreement. They have raised the phoney issue of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme cost rises when in fact they are voting for cost rises of pharmaceuticals. They are against it if it has anything to do with the free trade agreement - and it doesn't - but they are in favour of it if it has nothing to do with the free trade agreement. The logic of that, I think, would escape almost all human beings, and it certainly escapes the electorate.When it came to JSCOT, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, it is perfectly clear that many but not quite all Labor members wanted to sign off in support of the free trade agreement, and at the last moment somebody contacted them and said, `You had better not go that far.' We understand that the contact came from the office of the Leader of the Opposition. In other words, `Instruct committee members on how to vote; make sure they do not support the free trade agreement,' because, in the end, Labor wants to maintain its image of being viscerally anti-American, which the Labor Party leadership is, and the Labor Party believes that it will enhance Australia's status in Asia by downgrading our relations with our alliance partner. It will have the reverse effect. It will make Australia look weak. It will make Australia isolationist. And you win no respect in Asia by being weak. </DOC>

 - I would like to thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. It has always been the government's philosophy that, when it comes to spending patterns, we should leave that up to Australian families. What I find extraordinary today is not just what has been said about the maternity payment but also comments made by the member for Lilley, saying that we should mandate that people should get fortnightly payments, almost suggesting that Australian families cannot look after their own financial affairs. This is the absurd situation and that is the proposition being advocated by the Australian Labor Party: (a) we should not be giving lump sum payments; and (b) we should not be giving a $3,000 maternity payment, but that it should be a fortnightly payment. The suggestion by the Australian Labor Party is that Australian families are irresponsible; they cannot look after their own financial affairs and therefore the government has to legislate how they are paid. This is a ridiculous notion. In all the comments that I have received, particularly from a lot of expectant mothers, people are absolutely delighted that they will receive that $3,000 payment, which they can use for the provision of their children or for their home. In circumstances where we deem that an individual or a young mother is perhaps at risk - there could be a drug dependency problem or alcohol issues - then there is discretion by the secretary of the department to look at those particular narrow areas to ensure that that money is not all blown in one hit but used responsibly. The fact is that the Australian Labor Party want to invade households' lives. Last week they were telling us that families were irresponsible and that therefore they have to ban advertising on television. We have had notions from the Leader of the Opposition of parental contract orders. Today they are suggesting that Australian families are not responsible enough and that therefore every payment should be a fortnightly payment. The $3,000 payment is a good payment and we stand by it. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Canning for his question. I can inform the House that living standards in Australia have been strongly rising over the last eight years. This is reflected in various surveys of public opinion, including surveys about whether or not people have optimism for the future. Today Newspoll reports a survey where people were polled about their standard of living - whether they expected it to improve, stay the same or get worse or whether they were uncommitted. The level of those who thought that they would either maintain their standard of living or improve it over the next six months was the highest, at 84 per cent. That is a good thing, isn't it? Eighty-four per cent of Australians feel confident enough about their standard of living to say that they thought they were going to either maintain or improve their standard of living over the next six months. The level of those who thought things were going to get worse is the lowest it has been in this survey since 1997. In fact, if you look back to 1985 you see that it is the lowest level that has been recorded by that particular survey. So people are confident and optimistic about the future. It is good for our country that our country feels optimistic and confident. There are reasons why people feel optimistic and confident about their future in Australia. Real household disposable income, the key summary measure of economic wellbeing, has increased by 28 per cent. So household disposable income has increased under this government. Unemployment, at 5.5 per cent, is at a 23-year low. The number of jobs has increased significantly, with 1.3 million jobs having been created in Australia since 1996, and they have been widely shared around Australia.We can welcome to the House the children and companions from Camp Quality in Darwin who are visiting us today. The Territory is one of those areas which has been sharing in job creation and increasing standards of living. We have had continuous growth over the last eight years. Interest rates are at their lowest level in 30 years; inflation is down towards the bottom of the band of two to three per cent; and, best of all, at the national level, Labor's debt of $96 billion has been reduced under this government by $70 billion in net terms. That has set Australia up for much better opportunities in the future, but we cannot relax. Economic management is hard, it is difficult, and we have to maintain the pressure in relation to that. If you cannot govern a local council, you cannot govern a country. That is why it is important that we continue strong economic management in this country, that we do not lose focus, and that the coalition continues to work in relation to economic management for our children's future.</DOC>

 - I must thank the member for Lilley for his question. I have a greater chance of getting dorothy dixers from the opposition than from my own colleagues, but I do respect the Leader of the House and the deputy leader. Indeed, I must also thank the member for Lilley's office for sending through an email. It is not often that we receive one. It makes up all these cases; indeed, perhaps it was from the chap from Cooper Plains, who was contacting the member for Lilley's office. Let us put this into perspective. As it is now, 1.95 million families have received their bonus payments - and, of course, however many remain, until the end of business tomorrow. So 1.95 million Australian families have received that one-off payment and, of course, they are going to get that payment again next year, in September.It is interesting: last week the member for Lilley was complaining bitterly that we were not paying people enough. In the middle of last week he was complaining that we were not going to guarantee the value of the $600 into the future. Today he is complaining that we are paying them too much. The fact is that this is a constant pattern of sour grapes, because it is this government, through good economic management, that has been able to deliver this $19.2 billion increase in payments for the family tax benefit over the next four years. We have heard no policy suggestions on how the Labor Party is going to help Australian families. The only guarantee that we have is that the member for Lilley and the Australian Labor Party have refused to guarantee the $600 payment. The member for Lilley smirks. I am sure the over 9,000 families in Lilley would not appreciate the smirk that you are giving, when you have failed to guarantee that $600 payment.  - I would like to quote a few comments, because people are very grateful for the payment that they are receiving. I noticed that Adele Horin, writing in the Sydney Morning Herald today, talks about a lady, Linda Mondy, the senior manager for Western Sydney's UnitingCare Burnside. We know Western Sydney well. The article says that she turned up on Friday for the mothers' meeting at Doonside, and only two of the 10 regulars were there.'My staff tell me the women were excited, they'd been planning what to spend the money on - and it was on kid's clothes.'The Deputy Prime Minister gives another example. In Burke, Sally Bryant, a council community worker, said she had seen no negative impact on residents. She said:Most people have been strapped for cash because of the drought and the lack of casual work. They look upon this money with gratitude.Going to the Central Coast, there is a very good article by Jodie Sharp in the Daily Telegraph. She said:For families like mine - we are middle-income earners with two children - this government initiative is a godsend. I was considering having to work more hours in the near future and now I won't have to. I now make an informed decision at election time, and so far the government is showing me what I want to see - that is, it cares about young families and children, who are the future of our country. Keep it up, Mr Howard.There is no doubt that it is the coalition government that is continuing to deliver. As far as payments are concerned, bonuses will go to eligible individuals. If there is fraudulent activity, then of course we expect them to repay it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Farrer for her question. I can inform the House that there is an economic imperative to keep the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme financially sustainable. As I said when these measures were introduced back in 2002, no area of Commonwealth expenditure is growing faster. It increased 14 per cent before we announced that measure and 14 per cent afterwards. Its cost has quadrupled over the last decade and, according to our Intergenerational Report, would rise to a very substantial proportion of GDP over the next 40 years.The copayment is an instrument of good policy. A $2.50 copayment was introduced, in fact, by Labor with the support of the coalition. For the reasons that the Labor Party introduced it in 1990, this government announced in the 2002 budget that it would be increased so that we could share the cost of new pharmaceuticals between the taxpayer and the person concerned, with an adequate safety net. So there is a good economic and health case - and a public policy case - behind the measures which the government announced in relation to the PBS. The Labor Party, which now support it, could of course make that good case as to why they are supporting it. But the problem for the Labor Party, of course, is that they cannot actually enunciate the case for supporting these good policy measures because for 25 months the Labor Party engaged in opportunism; they engaged in needless scare tactics and they tried to defeat good policy in this country for their own shabby political advantage. Let me quote, for example, from Mr Stephen Smith - the member for Perth, I believe - who said this:Treasurer Costello's comments ... confirm that the Government's proposal to increase PBS co-payments across-the-board ... never had anything to do with health and everything to do with propping up a budget bottom line.That is what Mr Smith said. What is the reason for the Labor Party's support for these measures? It would not have anything to do with propping up a bottom line, would it? Or take what was said this morning on AM:Many Labor MPs are still smarting over the prescription medicines backflip, after arguing for two years that making drugs more expensive would hit the poorest and sickest. `Dumb and lousy' is how the unhappy MPs see the new policy - I ask the House to listen to this - When one angry frontbencher was asked how he could sell it to the voters, he answered, `Pretend it didn't happen.'Pretend it didn't happen. Can I say that the Labor Party are making a very good job of pretending it did not happen. If you look up the ALP web site as at this moment - click it up - there is absolutely no mention on the ALP web site that the Australian Labor Party are supporting the government's PBS measures. It just does not exist. It is almost as if it was never announced.After making sure that it was not on the web site that they had backflipped, I wondered what would happen if we went to Labor Party web sites to see whether they were still maintaining their opposition on their own web sites. It is very interesting. If you go to the web site of the member for Jagajaga, she still has a statement up there which she put up there in June 2002. Listen to this. This is how the Labor Party was campaigning. The site says:`Pensioners such as Mr Bill and Mrs Thelma Rogers from West Heidelberg are unhappy with the Howard government's proposed increases on the cost of prescription,' Jenny Macklin, federal member for Jagajaga, said today.I wonder if the member for Jagajaga has rung back Bill and Thelma Rogers and told Bill and Thelma that she supports these measures. I wonder if she has. It was good enough to bring Bill and Thelma into the public debate when they could be used to oppose PBS measures, wasn't it? I wonder if she has had the decency to ring up Bill and Thelma. Then we have a long statement there about Bill and Thelma's plight, and the statement finishes up by saying this. Listen to this, the member for Jagajaga. It is still up on the web site, by the way. It says:I would like to assure local residents that the Labor Party will strongly oppose these proposed increases in the cost of prescriptions. I have also created a petition to put pressure on the government to stop this unfair proposal.Listen to this; it is still there on the web site. It continues:Please contact my office on 9459 1411 if you would like a copy of this petition, and I will make sure your voice is heard in parliament.Can I suggest that the member for Jagajaga ring back every person who has signed that petition and tell them the petition is now closed - that putting your signature on this petition to oppose the PBS is not going to do much good. And can I suggest that maybe, just maybe, now that the Labor Party has changed its position, she could ring every one of those people that signed the petition and say: `It was all a fraud. It was all opportunism. The Labor Party supports this policy and I am sorry to have misled you over the last two years.' </DOC>

 - The ALP are totally desperate, aren't they? As I said in my previous answer, I really think this is sour grapes, because it has been this government - the Howard-Anderson government - through good economic management, particularly by our Treasurer, that have been able to deliver this dividend back to Australian families. The only thing Australian families have to worry about if they purchase items, anticipating that they are going to receive more family tax benefit in the future is the member for Lilley and the Australian Labor Party. They have refused to guarantee that $600 payment from 2005 into the future. This is the whole facade. Last week, it was not enough; this week, too much. What we do know is that the Australian Labor Party have still not come up with any family policies. - So now families should not be receiving it. Now the member for Lilley is suggesting that families, even in his own electorate, should not be receiving this payment. Is that what you are suggesting? - Mr Speaker, I know it is not you suggesting that, but the member for Lilley is. The fact is that, if Australian families are concerned about the family tax benefit, their concern should be directed to the Australian Labor Party, who are going to claw it back through the Latham lunge next year - if ever they have control of the Treasury benches - and take that $600 payment away from them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I enjoyed my time looking at some of those projects that you have been talking about that have needed to be addressed for so long but which will be addressed under AusLink. We recently announced AusLink, and it does highlight some very major works to be undertaken in New South Wales. Indeed, the construction budget for New South Wales goes up by 76 per cent over the next five years. We really will be presiding over some very serious infrastructure upgrades in that state, including duplicating the Hume Highway and the Pacific Highway, so we can get to the point in this country where we have major capital cities increasingly linked by dual carriageway.The Minister for Roads in New South Wales, Carl Scully, led me to believe that he was about to obviously do something really fantastic. I thought he must be. His reactions indicated that he had something that was so big and so spectacular that it would make everything we were doing pale into insignificance. He called our 76 per cent increase in the construction budget for New South Wales a disgrace and said that it fell well short. So it was that I waited to see what he would produce. The headlines were pretty spectacular in relation to the New South Wales budget this week. They said that it included a record roads budget. Mr Scully had a very colourful song to sing about that. He said that 2004-05 was a landmark year, with a record allocation involving huge increases. We must be reading different budget documents. The NRMA-Access Economics analysis of the New South Wales budget shows that next financial year's capital expenditure on roads - that is, what you actually spend on building them - has dropped by $22 million since 2002-03 and there had been a drop that year of $34 million from the previous year. So, in the past two years alone, road building has gone backwards $56 million in New South Wales, before you take inflation into account. There is more than that. Do you know what we found when we had a look at the projects they had listed in this giant increase in their New South Wales roads budget? We found that over 20 per cent of them are actually Australian government road announcements. They are federal government roads. Their magnificent new roads program is at least one-fifth ours, when you look at it closely. The drop in the actual New South Wales commitment to roads construction over the last two years is $250 million before inflation. This massive increase turns out to be a very significant decrease. Worse than that, of course, is that, at the same time that has been happening, motor vehicle taxes and charges in New South Wales have increased by $400 million. So there you go: it is quite a windfall indeed. Mr Scully was so desperate that, in his media statement, what was the first project he trumpeted? Westlink - the Western Sydney Orbital - at $110 million. How much of that money is state money? None. It is Australian government money.I want to make this point: it is time that Australian electors started to contemplate what life under a Latham Labor government would be like. It is time they started to think that through. Where might they find some clues on what it might be like? There are some people around Liverpool who could probably give them a pretty good idea. You could think back to what it was like when the Labor Party was last in office, you could contemplate having the modern version of those days, with Treasurer Crean's hand in your pocket, and you could also have a bit of a look at how the state governments run things. What it shows is that it is very expensive to run nanny states. Your taxes go up and up, so New South Wales motorists are paying more and more - it is a bit like that magic pudding thing - and, at the same time, of course, your services come down and the amount of money spent on capital works comes down. But it is all covered with the most extraordinary fudge - and that is what we have seen in New South Wales with their roads budget. We announced a 76 per cent increase in road building and, according to them, that is a disgrace. At the same time, according to them, a $250 million decline before inflation in road funding is a landmark achievement. People ought to remember what it is like living under a Labor government and start thinking about just what sort of a shambles Mr Latham would run.</DOC>

 - One of the things that we did when the new taxation system came into place in the year 2000 was to repackage 12 payments into three payments - family tax benefit part A, family tax benefit part B and the child-care benefit. At that time there was a decision, and I think it was a very wise decision made by the government, that parents could have a choice: they could receive it as a fortnightly payment or they could receive it as a lump sum. Indeed, a lot more Australian families have now been choosing to take that lump sum. To answer your question - and I would be interested in any specific cases if you would like to refer them to us - for those Australian families that were receiving a lump sum at the end of last year, there was a decision made that they would be entitled to that $600 payment. If they received a lump sum last year then they would be getting that $600 payment or multiples of it, depending on the number of children that they have.Again, I just want to remind the parliament that the greatest risk to Australian families when it comes to family tax benefit is the Australian Labor Party's position. They have failed to guarantee the $600 increase to the base rate and the maximum rate in the year 2005 and beyond. I hope that Australian families that are watching or listening to this broadcast today will go to their local ALP members in the House of Representa-tives and their senators and say, `Why haven't you guaranteed that $600 payment that we are receiving now as a bonus from the coalition government because of their good economic management?' And those eligible for family tax benefit will receive another one in September. They will all receive that payment if they are eligible for family tax benefit.Why are they not guaranteed that payment by the Australian Labor Party in years to come? This is just purely sour grapes on the part of the Labor Party. It is fantastic that we are able to assist 1.95 million Australian families, who are very grateful that they have been able to receive this payment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson, my next-door neighbour, for the question and I recognise his support for all government initiatives that are put in place to generate more jobs for more Australians - particularly in his part of New South Wales, which he represents very well in generating jobs. - The question went to the government's trade policy initiatives that stand to create thousands of jobs. - The overriding objective of our trade policy is to create opportunities for Australian exporters and to generate many thousands of jobs for future Australians. Of course that is the objective and I would expect that it would be the objective of any government in this country to expand the economy and see it grow to generate -  - As I was saying, the clear objective of the government's trade policy is to generate new export opportunities, economic growth and therefore jobs growth in Australia - to generate new jobs in the Australian economy. The member for Paterson also asked about any opposition to this policy objective. Of course, in recent weeks, we have seen that. In our efforts to promote trade and to promote new jobs, we have seen opposition from the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union's Doug Cameron. I note that the member who raised the point of order does not necessarily belong to that particular union, but this month we are again seeing the militant action of the AMWU, which is pressing the members of the opposition and the Senate on the issue of job losses. We have seen the AMWU waste hundreds of thousands of dollars of their members' money on an advertising campaign against the government's policy. Can you imagine an advertising campaign against the creation of 30,000 jobs? - I say again that this advertising campaign is clearly targeting stopping the creation of 30,000 new jobs in the Australian economy. Is that the role of a trade union, I ask you? Again yesterday, Doug Cameron was in the Parliament House confines lobbying against this deal. This particular union has been nailed before, not by the government but by former leaders of the Labor Party, for the form that they have. We all remember that, in 1986 -   - As I was saying, this particular organisation has form. That was identified in 1986 by the former Labor Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Paul Keating, when he accused the AMWU of having the scalps of a hundred thousand metalworkers hanging from its belt. This year, the Labor Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, indicated his view by likening Doug Cameron's ideas on trade policy to those of North Korea. What the government is trying to do is to generate jobs from the new export and training opportunities across the world. Organisations like the AMWU are out to stop the generation of jobs because those jobs might end up with members in other unions and not theirs. This parliament should make up its own mind and not be bullied by the unions of Australia -  - the AMWU, the AWU or the ACTU. None of them. -  - Mr Speaker -  - In conclusion, the point remains that the government's trade policy objectives, both bilateral and multilateral, are about generating opportunities for Australia's exporters and jobs for Australians in the future - not stopping them.</DOC>

 - If the honourable member wants to know how the Australian Federal Police conducted an investigation, my suggestion is that he should raise that with the Federal Police. I have said on this matter in the House during this week that my office fully cooperates with the Federal Police on any matter; there has never been an example where we have not fully cooperated with them. The point here is a very interesting point, because the honourable member for Griffith has asked several questions over the last year about this document. In those questions, he has revealed an intimate knowledge of the classification of the document, and the classification of the document itself is classified. He could only know that classification if he had seen the document himself. What would be interesting is how the member for Griffith knows so much about this document and who showed it to him. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. There are some threats to the Medicare system and I want to make it very clear that as far as this government is concerned we have one motto: `Don't mess with Medicare'. We say to members opposite, `Don't mess with Medicare.' This government fully supports the three pillars of Medicare: the Medicare benefits schedule, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the Australian health care agreements. We support them without question or qualification. We certainly do not support the establishment of a national health reform commission that would put bureaucrats, not patients, in the driver's seat of the MBS and the PBS. Let me remind the member for Lalor that she has made three major speeches in the last three months calling for the abolition of existing health programs and the pooling of this money in something reminiscent of the UK National Health Service at its worst. Three times this week she has stood up and made personal explanations to the effect of, `I said it but I didn't mean it.' It is the `Please don't take me seriously' defence from the member for Lalor.So you can imagine my surprise when I got up this morning and I saw an article on the front page of the Daily Telegraph `Labor plans Medicare smart card for all', an exclusive by Sue Dunlevy. It says the `ALP health policy unveiled yesterday' includes:A CONTROVERSIAL overhaul of health funding that would see federal and state funding for hospitals, aged care, rehabilitation and community care pooled and handed over to a regional health authority.Who do you think leaked that exclusively to Sue Dunlevy? It was not me; it was in fact the member for Lalor. I again say to the member for Lalor, `Come clean about your plans.' She might support the Medicare card, but she certainly does not support the Medicare system. In all of this, she is just faithfully echoing her master's voice. There was a proposal a while back from a Professor Dick Scotton to pool all health funding. None other than the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa, said of the Scotton proposal:This has the great benefit of pooling funding around the federal government ......	...	...This is guiding stuff. This is the best way to approach health policy. ... This plan has so many advantages that it needs to be further developed. ... I think it gives the best guide as to how we can now modernise Medicare and spread its success throughout the Australian health sector.That was the Leader of the Opposition in this parliament. This government does not want to modernise Medicare out of existence. This government supports Medicare. The only thing that members opposite like about Medicare is the name. I say to members opposite again and again, `Don't mess with Medicare.' This government will not mess with Medicare, but I say to the Australian people, `You can't trust Labor with your health.' </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question and for his very strong interest in attracting investment not only to his seat of Kalgoorlie - which has done particularly well in recent times - but also to Australia. This government stands for investment, jobs and growth.ABARE recently released a report which shows just how well we are delivering. In April 2004, ABARE released a list which showed there are some 192 resource based projects under development, of which some 62 are already under construction or committed to. This is a record number of projects at an advanced stage. They underline the fact that we are continuing to attract investment to the tune of some $21 billion in these projects alone. Invest Australia, a division of the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources, has played a major role in attracting 96 of these projects, worth some $15 billion, which have secured or created some 9,000 new jobs.What is the alternative to this? I am asked by the member for Kalgoorlie whether there are threats. There is a long list of threats from the Labor Party in terms of investment and future investment in Australia. The first on that list is to abolish Invest Australia - the very body that has attracted 96 projects worth $15 billion and secured or created some 9,000 jobs. I call on the Labor Party to reverse that decision, as they are so good at doing that now, and to work with this government to attract investment here. Secondly, Labor propose a massive new tax on the resource sector. By winding back the diesel fuel excise rebate Labor would increase the excise on the mining industry by $500 million. I ask Labor, in the interests of encouraging resource development in Australia, to drop that proposal.Thirdly, of course - and I know this is the member for Hunter's favourite policy - there is the highly interventionist policy of `use it or lose it' on petroleum resource leases. There is no single policy that will frighten away investment in the petroleum industry faster and bring an end to exploration for oil and gas reserves faster than that policy. I ask the Labor Party to do a backflip on that policy and stop the damage that they are already doing.This government has delivered the policy settings that are attracting a record amount of investment in Australia. It is time the Labor Party did a triple backflip and abandoned the policies that are frightening investment away from Australia. It is time they reversed their decisions. It is time they joined with this government, adopted our policies and ensured that we continue the economic growth in Australia. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Ballarat for her question because it gives me the opportunity to once again remind the House of the enormous economic damage that the Labor Party's policy of a five per cent target for the mandatory renewable energy target scheme would bring. The cost to the economy in lost GDP of the five per cent target would be of the order of $11½ billion. - This would have an enormous effect on jobs throughout the economy. It would have an enormously discouraging effect on investment in jobs in regional Australia. - It would put up electricity prices, and it would have a very damaging effect. The fact that the Labor Party refuses to concede the impact of the extraordinary policy that it has, which of course it supplements with a policy for a national emissions trading scheme, shows that the Labor Party simply does not understand why the Australian economy has been so successful over the last eight years. It has been successful over the last eight years because this government has pursued policies which keep taxes down, which encourage business and which encourage people to invest and to produce the wealth that we need to invest in improving our environment. We do not believe in putting on an economic hairshirt and devastating the Australian economy for no real environmental gains by adopting policies which have very damaging effects right throughout regional Australia. I advise the member for Ballarat to stop this scare talk, to stop promulgating this scare talk and to recognise that the enormous encouragement given to renewable energy technologies in the energy and environment statement, particularly to wind and other key technologies for regional Australia, if taken up by the industry can only be beneficial to the commercial adoption of those technologies.</DOC>

 - May I take the opportunity to thank the member for O'Connor for being a champion for small business. He comes straight out of the trench and takes on the Labor Party, who are out to crush small businesses in Australia. The member for O'Connor has long been an advocate for good small-business activity. My attention has been drawn to a report from Australian Business Ltd - a survey of their members - which has been released today. It identifies the significant impact of the current unfair dismissal laws on small business. It says that the impact of unfair dismissal legislation was identified by 75 per cent of respondents as a major or moderate concern. I know that does not bother the member for Rankin, who is in the vanguard of the fight of the union movement to do everything it can to close down casual employment. The member for Jagajaga says it is better not to have a job than to be employed casually. An honourable member - Really? - That is what the member for Jagajaga says: it is better not to have a job than to have a casual job. What an astounding comment to make for all those people working on farms in casual employment, and in restaurants, in cafes and in the hotel industry right across the economy. And the member for Jagajaga is saying that it is far better for them not to have a job than to have casual employment.I keep asking myself: why does the Labor Party keep fighting against us on the reform of the unfair dismissal laws? I keep asking that question. I thought it must have something to do with the composition of the Labor Party frontbench. The Leader of the Opposition has never worked in business full time. We cannot find that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has ever worked in business. The shadow Treasurer, the member for Hotham, has never worked in business. The shadow minister for small business has never worked in business - unless you call Centenary House a business!A government member - It's a business all right! - It is a business: it is a property portfolio; it is funds management! We long for the days of Barney Cooney. We wish that Barney Cooney, who was the sole champion of small business -  - That is right; he was a barrister. Former senator Barney Cooney was in fact the last Labor senator ever to work in small business. Eighty per cent of the Labor senators are former trade union officials. I heard some recent comments from former senator Chris Schacht - who was himself shot, really, wasn't he? He had some refreshing words to say. He identified that the Labor Party had changed its tune on its recruitment to the Senate. In passing, while saying that the Labor Party is making great strides in changing the make-up of its senators, he said, `We are replacing male trade union officials with female trade union officials.' - That is balancing it up. We thank him for that, but we also thank the member for Chifley for his comments yesterday. I remind the House that the member for Chifley said yesterday that the government should be able to govern. On more than 40 occasions the Labor Party have opposed our attempts to free Australia's 1.2 million small businesses from the burden of the unfair dismissal laws. We ask the Labor Party to stop doing a Roger to small business. We want the Labor Party to do a Roger to their own policy on the unfair dismissals legislation, pass our legislation and give small business a chance to employ more people. - I am happy to table it. </DOC>

 - It is hard to express how grateful I am to receive that question from the Labor Party, because I have been intrigued by a statement made by the leader of the Labor Party that has been repeated just now in the question by the member for Capricornia. The statement is that the Labor Party will ban exploration and drilling on or near the Great Barrier Reef. The fact is that drilling on the Great Barrier Reef is prevented by law under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975. In other words, since 1975, drilling on the reef has been prevented, yet the Leader of the Opposition is going around telling the Australian people that he is going to do something about this. He is either completely ignorant of the laws or utterly dishonest and deceitful in what he says about the protection of the Great Barrier Reef, because he is undertaking to do something which has been law in this country for over 25 years.Then we have concerns being expressed about possible dangers to the reef from drilling off the reef. This government has introduced environment protection and biodiversity conservation legislation which specifically empowers the Minister for the Environment and Heritage to prevent any action which could have any detrimental effect on the values of the Great Barrier Reef. Of course, this legislation completely protects the reef from any of the activities which the member is implying may possibly have an adverse impact on tourism and other industries within the reef.The government which has protected the Great Barrier Reef more than any government in Australia's history is this government. I am delighted to be able to say that on 1 July the new zoning plan for the Great Barrier Reef will come into operation. It will lift the protections of the Great Barrier Reef from some five per cent of the marine park to over 33 per cent of the marine park. It is very interesting to hear what the major interests concerned with the reef have said about the government's policies. The Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators, the industry quoted by the member, said:I doubt that I will see a more important conservation effort in the world anywhere in my lifetime.The Game Fishing Association of Australia Research and Development Foundation said:... the minister and GBRMPA - the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority - have listened to the concerns expressed by hundreds of gamefishers from all over Australia ... restoring faith in the public-consultation process.The recreational fishing body Sunfish, through its chair, Bill Turner, said:Just like we stopped the rape and pillage of the rainforest, we think the same should apply to the Great Barrier Reef.Sir David Attenborough said:The Australian people are increasing protection for one of the natural wonders of the world.In other words, this government is the government that has put in place the protections that the Great Barrier Reef requires. What we have on the other side of the House are deceitful and misleading statements promising the Australian people that Labor will do things which have been law in this country for almost 30 years. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question. Tomorrow presents us as a nation with a historic opportunity to respond to and confirm a vast amount of work that has been done over the last 10 months in developing what I believe is the bedrock for the world's best water management framework, which is appropriate in a continent as dry as ours. If agreed to, this will give the investment certainty needed to underpin economic and environmental futures in this country. It will provide pathways for a return to sustainability in over-allocated systems. These very important objectives can happen only with the goodwill and commitment of the states in whom constitutional power for water in the state is vested. We provided the leadership necessary to make it happen. I trust that tomorrow the states will be able to ensure that they have put aside their remaining differences and we can secure this very important outcome for Australia and for future Australians. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - In answer to the Leader of the Opposition, no, I do not concede that. If we had conceded that, we would never have approved the agreement in the first place. What the Leader of the Opposition has got to do is finally make up his mind where he stands on this. I read the statement put out by the Leader of the Opposition before his press conference following the caucus meeting and there was no mention of conditionality in that statement. Yet, in answer to questions, he inferred that Labor's support for the free trade agreement was conditional on the government putting forward amendments along the lines that the Leader of the Opposition has suggested, and also in relation to local content. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition: I would have thought that after five months he would have finally made up his mind, but it seems as though he has not.Our position is clear; it has been clear for 5½ months. We support this agreement because it is good for Australia. It was good for Australia when it was signed. It would not have been signed if it had not been good for Australia. It would not have been signed if it carried within it the seeds of any diminution in the high quality of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The Leader of the Opposition knows that we have a robust patent regime in this country and if companies make applications which are spurious and ill based for extension of patents those applications will be thrown out. That is the position at the present time and nothing that the Leader of the Opposition has said suggests to me that amendments or changes along the lines that he has in mind are necessary. The Leader of the Opposition should finally get off the fence, take a decision and stick up for Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. I know the member for Page has been a very strong advocate for and supporter of the agreement, particularly on behalf of his all-important beef industry in the Clarence Valley. In answer to the question, it is welcome to see that we are almost there in getting recognition and support for the importance of the free trade agreement. This morning the Leader of the Opposition agreed, finally, to conditionally support the free trade agreement. After five months of dithering, he has finally shown the courage to conditionally support what is $6 billion worth of benefit to the Australian economy - 30,000 new jobs in the Australian economy. It has been recognised by everybody across this land. Every other state Labor leader in this country has recognised its value to their individual constituency and collectively to the nation. It is worth noting that at the outset, after the negotiation and the agreement were concluded, the Prime Minister said:It is an historic agreement. It will add enormous long-term benefits to the Australian economy....	...	...... a once in a generation opportunity ...We should contrast that with continuous statements of ambiguity by the Leader of the Opposition over the months since January of this year. In January, the Leader of the Opposition said that if the agreement does not stack up Labor will not support it. In February, he said they would oppose it. In March, he said he wanted to look at the modelling. In April, he said he was against bilateral agreements. In May, he was so confused he wanted to ask the Australian people. But in June, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties - and there are Labor members of parliament on that committee - supported the free trade agreement when they brought their recommendation back to the parliament. I might add that that instrument in this parliament - that is, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties - and that level of scrutiny of international treaties never existed under a Labor government. Then, in July, he said that it was not a free trade agreement. Now, in August, he says yes to the text of the free trade agreement but wants to amend the enabling legislation - conditional support that has taken five months to recognise the national interest involved here.To be a leader of this nation, you need to be decisive; you need to be able to make decisions quickly. You need not to take five months to recognise what is in the national interest of this nation. Heaven help us if there were a Labor government and the member for Werriwa were the Prime Minister and it took five months to make a decision about the national interest on every occasion that that was presented to him.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition is offering a fig leaf to the left wing of his own party. That is what the Leader of the Opposition is doing. We have a very clear position. The Leader of the Opposition is either in favour of this agreement or against this agreement. I have the transcript of his press conference today and time and time again he was asked whether the acceptance or otherwise by the government of the two proposals he has put forward for legislation were going to be deal breakers or not so far as the Leader of the Opposition is concerned. Let me make it very clear to the Leader of the Opposition that we will look at both of those proposals on their merits. I have to say that I do not think that the proposal in relation to the pharmaceutical companies that the Leader of the Opposition has put forward has any merit at all. It is a completely unnecessary amendment, because we have a patent procedure in this country and if you make a dodgy application that dodgy application is not accepted. The proposition that you should introduce penalties for a narrow range of patent applicants is not something that, on the information available, we think is necessary. No doubt the Leader of the Opposition and his cohorts in the Senate will let us know what the details of the amendment are but, from what I know of it, the amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition is not necessary and, on that basis, it would not necessarily be something we would support. The Leader of the Opposition's problem is that, after five months, he still cannot make up his mind. Is he in favour of the free trade agreement or is he against it? The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition has made a political decision to support the free trade agreement, there are people in his own party who are opposed to that decision and he is offering them the fig leaf of these two amendments. He should have had the courage to make a clean-cut decision five months ago, and he should have had the courage to do so this morning.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. I have seen such claims. They have been repeatedly and hysterically made by members opposite for the last five months, and I can assure the House that the claims are completely untrue. But, when it comes to slagging the United States, members opposite will never let the facts get in the way of a good scare. From the very beginning of the free trade agreement process, the government were determined to protect the integrity of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We said we would protect the integrity of the scheme, and we have precisely delivered on that commitment. Under the free trade agreement, prices for patients will not rise, legislation will not change, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee will remain the gatekeeper to the PBS and cost effectiveness will remain the criterion under which drugs are listed on the PBS. There will be an independent review process to enhance the transparency of the PBS generally, but all this means is that the PBAC might reconsider a recommendation. Let me make it crystal clear to members opposite that no drug can be listed on the PBS without a recommendation from the PBAC.This government has been completely consistent and clear every day of the last five months, unlike members opposite. First of all they said they would probably oppose the free trade agreement. Now they say they will probably support the free trade agreement. They still cannot make up their minds about the best deal this country has been offered in generations to lock our economy into the largest and strongest economy in the world. That is the trouble with `Dr Flip-flop', the Leader of the Opposition: he cannot say yes, he cannot say no, he always says maybe. If he does not know where he stands on the United States free trade agreement, he is completely disqualified from the prime ministership of this country. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. The benefits of this deal are quite clear and quite simple: $6 billion to the bottom line of the Australian economy after 10 years and 30,000 new jobs have been clearly stated in independent economic analysis. The member for Deakin also asked about what has become of local content rules through this agreement. Simply put, the Australian people, through their representatives and through the government, require the ability to always be able to tell Australian stories with Australian voices through the media in Australia. The outcome of the free trade agreement with America entitles us and enables us to continue always to do just that. We have retained the existing 55 per cent local content rules for television and importantly the 80 per cent local content rules for commercial advertisements on free-to-air television, which is incredibly important for the acting community in Australia. In fact, when multichannelling eventuates in Australia there will be the opportunity for even more Australian content on television in terms of expanding those local content rules across the digital platform in the multichannelling environment. We have ensured that Australian content in a variety of different fields will be available through dozens of channels on pay TV.As far as future media is concerned, in the decades ahead we may well be watching media that have not been developed yet, and we have ensured that there is a capacity to maintain adequate local content through those future operations. So it is quite clear that the wishes of the Australian people, the wishes of the audiovisual sector in Australia and the clear mandate of our government in these negotiations have been delivered in this agreement in terms of local content on free-to-air television and moving through to the digital platform and other areas and, as I said, most importantly in terms of commercial advertisements on free-to-air television, which has been a crucial element of the local content rules. When Australian actors have free access - there are no limitations - to the US market, why should they try and impede the ability of other exporters to get similar access into that market? I say again: as a result of this agreement, we have ensured that Australian stories will continue to be told with Australian voices on Australian free-to-air television.</DOC>

 - I thought I might get asked that question. My understanding is that the responsibility for setting the local content requirement was first given to the ABA in 1992 - and, if my recollection serves me correctly, the Labor Party was in government in 1992. In those circumstances, it is interesting to me that this issue should come up.In relation to that particular proposal, I have said that I will examine it and the government will look at it on its merits. But, if the opposition are serious about this and it is to be taken from the ABA, and if there are no other impediments to this occurring, they should contemplate the desirability and the possibility of this being incorporated in regulations rather than in legislation. One of the reasons for that - and I address this through you, Mr Speaker, seriously to the member for Melbourne - is that there are subquotas under the existing arrangements in relation to children's content and documentaries if you are to try and entrench them, which we intend to adhere to.I just repeat what the Minister for Trade said: we gave nothing away and, in fact, gained ground on the local content issue in the negotiations. I was amazed to see on, I think, Meet the Pressat the weekend the Victorian president of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance say that absolutely nothing had been done to protect Australian content in relation to the new media and that we had just surrendered any capacity to exercise an influence over new media when, as the Minister for Trade quite correctly pointed out, the capacity to regulate to ensure the availability of local content on new media platforms has been reserved so that, if in the future the government determine that Australians are being unreasonably denied access to Australian material, we can take action to ensure that that happens. But once again, with the opposition having said, `Oh, we're going to support the agreement' or `We think we're going to support the agreement,' that support is conditional -  - The member for Canberra says, `We are.' - The member for Fraser. I know I always get that wrong, but I know who interjected. The shadow finance minister says that the Labor Party is going to support the free trade agreement. He has spoken with a lot more clarity than his leader did at his press conference. His leader implied that the two issues that he raised were, in fact, immovable conditions and that, if those conditions were not met, the commitment of the Labor Party to support the free trade agreement would be in doubt.If I misrepresent the Leader of the Opposition, I am sure at the end of question time he will get up and take a personal explanation and put it beyond argument that the Labor Party support for the free trade agreement as negotiated by the government is unconditional. He has an opportunity to do that at the end of question time - to stand up and say that the Labor Party's support for the free trade agreement as negotiated by the government is unconditional and to run away from this pretence that he put forward at his news conference that in some way it was conditional on us accepting these two amendments. I say to the member for Melbourne that I have indicated that we will look at that particular proposal on its merits. But I think there are great difficulties in trying to incorporate in legislation, as distinct from regulations, the detailed subquotas in relation to things such as children, and we will be getting some further advice on that. Quite frankly, so far as the substance of the issue is concerned, I have said that we will examine it on its merits. But it is beyond argument that the existing local content arrangements have been preserved. We have won extensions in relation to pay television and there is adequate reservation in relation to the new media. The alarmist talk that has come from the Labor Party and others on this issue lacks any substance at all.</DOC>

 - First can I thank the honourable member for his question and recognise the interest he shows in the workings of our relationship with the United States. We, Senator Hill and I, held AUSMIN, the Australia-US ministerial meeting, on 7 July in Washington. We had meetings predominantly with secretaries Powell and Rumsfeld. I also met with Attorney-General Ashcroft, and both Senator Hill and I spent a useful time with Vice-President Cheney. During the meeting we signed a memorandum of understanding on missile defence, which is a longterm measure to counter potential threats to the United States and its allies from missiles from rogue states. We reached agreement with the United States on the Australia-United States joint combined training centre. Very importantly, there was a heavy focus in those discussions, as you would expect, on counter-terrorism in South-East Asia, the Pacific and of course the Middle East.The member for Kalgoorlie asks whether there are any alternative views, and of course there are. There is the visceral, irrational anti-Americanism - the knee-jerk anti-Americanism - of the Leader of the Opposition. In his time as the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Werriwa has fed the anti-American instincts of many members of the Australian Labor Party. He has encouraged anti-Americanism in the Australian Labor Party. His statements have, in all the time he has been the Leader of the Opposition, been instinctively anti-American. Sometimes he has started to move his position a little later, when he has realised he has done himself political damage; but his instinctive, gut position is always to attack America first and think later.So when it came to the free trade agreement, on 9 February, the day after the free trade agreement was signed, the Leader of the Opposition said, `If we were asked to vote on it today or in the parliament tomorrow, we would be opposing it.' That was the initial tone that the Leader of the Opposition set without ever having read the free trade agreement. He claims today he did not know anything about it at that time. That is what he claims now - that he needed 5½ months to go through the free trade agreement. But his initial instinct is what is so revealing: it was to oppose the free trade agreement. It had been put up as an agreement with the Americans so ipso facto it must be wrong. Now, today, we have him moving from his instinctive anti-Americanism to sitting on the fence, to playing games with the free trade agreement instead of supporting something which is manifestly in the best interests of Australia. But so it applies to other aspects of the American relationship. When it comes to missile defence the Leader of the Opposition, we all know and the Australian public know, would know nothing about missile defence, has shown no interest in it, has never made a speech about it of any substance and with any background information and has never been briefed on the issue; but he is against it. If he is not briefed, he is against it. On keeping Australian troops in Iraq: `Well, the Americans are in Iraq; I am against it.' Had he been briefed on it? No. The Leader of the Opposition knew nothing about what the Australian troops were doing in Iraq on 23 March, but he was against it; it was time they got out.This is a pattern that we have had in all the time the member for Werriwa has been the Leader of the Opposition. It actually contrasts with the pattern set by the shadow Treasurer when he was the Leader of the Opposition and, obviously, by the now shadow minister for defence when he was the Leader of the Opposition. The instinct of the member for Werriwa as Leader of the Opposition is a visceral anti-American instinct. The movement in his position on the free trade agreement is not about a change of heart; it is about political survival. That is what has driven him. But if he were ever to become Prime Minister of this country - God forbid that he would, but if he ever did - that anti-Americanism would be a fundamental tenet of Australian government policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Paterson for his question and I can tell him that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry today released its business expectations survey which found that there is an increase in business confidence, broadly based, reflecting healthy sales revenue, healthy employment and profits data. It is broadly consistent with the National Australia Bank's business survey. The survey released today by the ACCI finds that business confidence has reached the highest level since November 1995, the highest level since the survey began. So that is the highest that has ever been recorded by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.If you want to keep your economy growing, you need to keep business confident. That is pretty clear. The key drivers which have kept business confident have been strong retail spending, low interest rates and good consumer sentiment, and we have now had 10 consecutive months where the unemployment rate has been below six per cent. That is equal to the record of 1981, and, if unemployment continues for an 11th month at below six per cent, we will pass the record run of below six per cent set in 1981. So, with more people in work, with interest rates low, with consumer sentiment strong as a result and with profitability up, business is confident. What could put all of that at risk? The kind of economic management that you have seen down at the Liverpool council. The kind of economic management that, according to the auditor of the Liverpool City Council, Mr Banicevic, put the budget into deficit; led to a claim that the number of employees had declined whilst they were still on the payroll - a rather unique claim that has been made by the member for Werriwa - and led to follies like the Oasis development, a development which the member for Werriwa championed earlier in his career. I keep on saying that if you cannot govern a council, you cannot govern a country.The member for Werriwa seems to be the only one that believes that he left the Liverpool council in surplus - the audited reports are to the contrary, Mr Banicevic's evidence is to the contrary and the finding of Professor Daly is to the contrary. Although it has been asserted here in the House, no documentary evidence whatsoever has been actually provided to back up that claim. It could be that the member for Werriwa is right, the audited accounts are wrong, Professor Daly is wrong and Mr Banicevic is wrong, but those of us that actually can read financial accounts believe it much more likely that the auditor is right, the commission of inquiry is right, the audited accounts are right and the story which the member for Werriwa has given to this House is not the full story. The member for Werriwa has been given lots of opportunities to explain, and we call upon him - not the member for Melbourne - to get to his feet and do the explaining.</DOC>

 - I am glad the Leader of the Opposition has asked a question about the Flood report because it gives me an opportunity to, rather than put the gloss that the Leader of the Opposition has put on the report, remind the House that the Flood report confirmed that the intelligence agencies `drew the most likely conclusions from the available information and generally presented them with appropriate qualification'. The Flood report concluded:... the assessments produced by ONA and DIO up to the commencement of combat operations reflected reasonably the available information and used intelligence sources with appropriate caution ... It is also important that the Flood report came to the conclusion that on the available evidence the proposition put to the government, particularly by ONA, was a more probable hypothesis than the opposite conclusion - namely, that Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction. Also, the Flood report has completely debunked the proposition so vigorously retailed by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Griffith that this government took this country to war based on a lie. That was never the position, and that claim itself was a lie. The Flood report has made it very clear that at no stage did the government attempt in any way to influence the intelligence agencies of this country. Also Flood reached the conclusion that the intelligence agencies in this country had advised and commented with considerably more caution than had the intelligence agencies of other countries.Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that since 11 September 2001 we have spent an additional $3.2 billion on national security, that ASIO's budget has been doubled since September 2001 and that its staffing levels are at the levels of the Cold War period. The Australian Federal Police budget has been doubled since September 2001, and there has been increased funding for aviation and maritime security. I also point out to the Leader of the Opposition that, with the exception of the name change recommended by Mr Flood, I have announced that the government will implement all of the recommendations that have been made by the Flood report. Moreover, in recent years, to my recollection, all requests for additional resources that have come to us from the intelligence agencies have in fact been acceded to. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that I am very happy to answer any questions he likes on the Flood report, but any attempt by him to construct an argument that in some way our treatment of the intelligence agencies reduced their capacity to properly advise the government is completely false.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dickson for his question. I can inform the honourable member that under the Charter of Budget Honesty the Treasury and Department of Finance are available to independently cost the policies of both government and opposition in an election campaign. The record of the Labor Party in having their policies costed is not a good one, I regret to inform the House. In 1998 the ALP made 319 spending commitments. They submitted 28 for costing on the Tuesday before election day and 87 on the Thursday two days before polling day when they could not actually be costed. In the 2001 election the ALP put in 125 commitments but withheld from being costed 164 promises that had a financial impact.The reason I raise this is that all of Australia awaits the member for Werriwa's tax policy. All of Australia awaits it because it was promised in budget week. We were then rather intrigued that on 6 July the Leader of the Opposition announced that PricewaterhouseCoopers had been appointed `to independently audit our funding and our commitments'. This is a claim that is habitually and regularly made by the Leader of the Opposition on radio throughout Australia. Whenever he is asked where the money is coming from, he makes this claim that Pricewaterhouse is independently looking at the funding commitments of the Australian Labor Party. So it was with quite some interest that I saw that Pricewaterhouse put out a press release on 12 July, six days after that claim was made on radio, disclosing the terms of its engagement by the Australian Labor Party. Let me read this. Pricewaterhouse: ... have not been asked to conduct an audit ...Listen to this:... and therefore will not verify or validate the accuracy or completeness of the 2004 ALP election commitments. Accordingly, we will not be expressing any assurance or opinion on the assumptions used by the ALP for costing their commitment initiatives or on the financial impact of the 2004 ALP election commitments ...I have never heard an auditor repudiate their client so directly and so far in advance. I have never heard an auditor actually repudiate their client before the audit has begun, before they have seen the books. This is a bizarre claim for the Leader of the Opposition to have made, that PwC would independently audit Labor's funding and their commitments. What does PwC say: `We have not been asked to conduct an audit. We will not verify or validate the accuracy or the completeness...'It raises the question as to what PwC is actually doing. It turns out that the ALP is going to make the assumptions, the ALP is going to write the policy, the ALP is going to say what the cost is and then PwC will sit down with an adding machine and make sure that the numbers all come up to what the ALP has said. That engagement of PricewaterhouseCoopers, as PricewaterhouseCoopers has made clear, will substantially verify nothing in relation to those promises. The whole purpose of the engagement is not so that PricewaterhouseCoopers can actually audit what went on. After all, if an audit went on it might come to the kind of conclusion that Mr Banicevic came to about the Liverpool Council. It is so that their name can be used in an effort to create some kind of plausibility around these financial commitments. As is clear, I think, now to nearly all of this side of the House and may well be dawning on the other side of the House, the opposition leader has made promises which do not stand financial scrutiny. He is promising simultaneously to cut taxes, spend more money, invest in an intergenerational fund and have more left over at the end of it. No wonder Pricewaterhouse is not taking this engagement.The only way that the ALP will be put under any scrutiny whatsoever is if they submit their costings under the Charter of Budget Honesty - which they have refused to do in the last two elections - so that the people of Australia have some basis on which to compare the promises of the government and the opposition. If this opposition wanted to be taken seriously in economic debate, it would produce its policies and it would have them costed. Until it does so, it cannot be taken seriously in relation to any of those matters.</DOC>

 - As the shadow minister, the member for Brand, would know, when government takes decisions of this kind there are a range of assessments before it. We obtained from the Office of National Assessments in relation to this matter their assessment of the position concerning WMD. We had in the course of our numerous discussions a range of opinions and advice from various sources. We took, taking into account ONA's assessment, the decision that we regarded as the appropriate one. It has been the subject of very exhaustive debate since. It remains the case that, if the course of action advocated by the Australian Labor Party had been followed, Saddam Hussein would still be running Iraq. I take the opportunity of reminding the member for Brand of that, just as I have reminded the Leader of the Opposition and the person who led the Labor Party between the member for Brand and the member for Werriwa. There are choices involved. Governments take political responsibility for the decisions they take. We have the political responsibility for the decision that we took. The intelligence assessment was one of the assessments that we took into account. It was not the only assessment, and the member for Brand knows that full well.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Transport security is a responsibility of both government and industry. The government takes very seriously in particular the role of regulating industry, because it is industry that provides security at our ports, at our airports, on our airlines and on our ships. We are committed to ensuring that our national security policy settings are appropriate and up to date. As the Prime Minister has referred to today, since September 2001 no less than $3.2 billion has been committed to national security, including some $870 million for intelligence capabilities.We are continually monitoring the threat to our transport system in particular, and I think all members of the House would acknowledge the importance of that, given that transport is so often used as a vehicle for the visitation of evil ends on innocent people by terrorists. There has been a lot of focus on aviation, and that is understandable, but of course we have been very active in other areas, including maritime, land transport and, in consultation with the states, mass transit as well.In relation to aviation, can I say that I am delighted that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audits, under the chairmanship of the member for La Trobe, found that Australia's aviation security framework is strong. It gave it a very clean bill of health indeed, having moved around the country and talked to people in industry and at airports and so forth across the length and breadth of Australia. It has to be said that it is just not possible to move 50 million passengers a year without, from time to time, experiencing incidents. We have had some recent examples of those. We take them seriously and we learn from them, but I want to make the point that, thus far - and I know the House is very appreciative of this - we have managed to keep at bay any terrorist activity on our shores in aviation.Can I say that we are very active on regional aviation. We have committed $35 million, with the recent top-up of $25 million in grant funding, to regional aviation security. We are meeting the cost of installing hardened cockpit doors for small aircraft. We are, of course, doing a number of other things, such as upgrading security at regional airports. We continue to monitor that. We will continue to take forward further measures as they are deemed necessary. In relation to maritime security, which has not received anything like the public attention of air security but which is extraordinarily important to the safety and well-being of people not just in industry but in our harbours and on our seaboard, no less than 247 maritime plans have been approved. They said we would never get there by 1 July, which was the deadline for the implementation of our international obligations - the very obligations that we played a significant part in drawing up. We did get there. I want to say that a lot of credit is due to the maritime industry. They have taken it seriously. Their cooperation has been fantastic and we are all safer because of it.Recently, of course, we did conduct a further review, through the senior authorities responsible, of maritime security. The outcome of that was an announcement by the Prime Minister in Brisbane of a further $102 million for maritime security, consisting of: over $4 million for the Office Of Transport Security's operations centre in my department so that it can operate around the clock; $48 million over four years to increase the rate of container examination at the Customs X-ray facilities in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Fremantle, and that has been particularly welcomed by industry; $9.3 million to enable Customs to board more vessels at the first port of arrival in Australia - all vessels can assume that they may be boarded - $17 million over four years to extend the Customs closed-circuit television network from the current 32 Customs proclaimed ports to 63 of these ports; and $12 million over four years to post specialist immigration officers to ports to assist with border control. And there is more beyond that.I just make the closing remark that we take security in transport very seriously in Australia. I asked my office to look to see whether the member for Batman and his colleagues had had anything of substance to say in recent times in relation to transport security, and we downloaded the relevant page - here it is. It is headed `Improving national security' and it makes the amazing claim that Labor will `protect our nation's security and the integrity of Australia's borders' and says that in government they will create a department of homeland security and establish a `coast guide'. That is the length and breadth of it - that is all there is. That is all they have got after all of this time. The previous spokesperson for transport and regional services - the then member for Dickson - had more to say and put more to paper and was more engaged in policy development than the member for Batman, and, boy, that is saying something.</DOC>

 - Dear, oh me! First of all, the quote is wrong. Secondly, let me understand where the opposition stands on this: it is all right to attack the President of the United States, it is all right to attack the great `Satan', America - I see a slightly disturbing stare has appeared over there - but if anyone dares criticise anyone else it is all wrong. In 8½ years of my being the foreign minister of Australia, there has not been a single time when the Labor Party has failed to take the opportunity to pick up on an attack by a foreign country on Australia. If ever the government are attacked by a foreign country, the Labor Party is out there taking their side. We find that on these issues. We found that on East Timor: `We're all on their side, not on Australia's side.' But of course there is an exception. There is one country worse than Australia for the Labor Party: the United States of America. I would choose your questions a little more carefully than that one. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question, because we know of the very significant interest that the member for Herbert takes in matters relating to national security. The Australian government has acted swiftly and decisively to strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism capabilities, particularly in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks as well as the Bali bombings. Since that time, new resources and capabilities have been provided across government, with an additional $3.2 billion committed to national security and border protection, including $870 million for intelligence agencies. I can confirm to the honourable member for Herbert that ASIO's budget has doubled, with more than $131 million over four years committed in the last budget and more than $50 million over four years for the protection of critical infrastructure. Of that, $29 million was for my portfolio. More than $50 million over five years was announced by the Prime Minister prior to the last budget to establish the National Threat Assessment Centre. That brings together agencies assessing terror threats and intelligence.There is not always a clarity of view in relation to these matters. Today I noticed that the member for Barton issued a press release in which he was critical of a number of announcements made by government and suggested that there had been, in a number of incidents, double-counting. I noticed that he described one announcement - that is, the $6.1 million commitment to the national security hotline - as a `phoney' announcement. I can only conclude that the honourable member for Barton has some difficulty in reading the budget papers, because a glance at the budget appropriation statements for the past two years would confirm that this is new money that was announced in this year's budget. The first funding was for one year, and if there were to be further funding there needed to be fresh funding.Of course, the Labor Party can speak with authority on dressing up old policies as new initiatives. One only needs to look at their `coastguide meet and greet' policy, which has been repackaged and reannounced on four occasions. When Labor first came up with the `coastguide' -  - I acknowledge the foreign minister's crediting of the policy with that title. When Labor came up with this idea in 2001, it was said to cost $891 million. After the election, when he was leader, the member for Hotham announced a cheaper version, at $612 million over four years. The present Leader of the Opposition had another go at it in March this year. Not to be outdone, the homeland security spokesman, the member for Barton, had a bargain basement version in June of $450 million. I would like to recall a comment that I heard from the honourable member for Barton this morning on the AM program. He had this to say: I mean, we'll give them one go - we'll even give them two goes - but when they start announcing these things three and four times over with the same funds, then we get a bit jack of that.Well, the member for Barton might get a bit jack of hearing about what the government have been doing in this area, but I thank him for the opportunity he has given me in reiteration time to ensure that the House is aware of the activities that we have been undertaking in this area.</DOC>

 - I have seen the statement attributed to the vice president. Can I say at the outset that we have not as yet seen the precise terms of the amendment that is being put forward. The basis of the amendment which has been set out by the Leader of the Opposition and various other shadow ministers is wrong. The amendment proceeds on a total misunderstanding of how the patent law of this country operates. It assumes that the patent law of this country operates in the way the United States patent law operates, and it does not. In Australia there are no automatic injunctions available as there are in the United States. And in Australia, contrary to what has been alleged by the Labor Party, the lodgment of a patent application does not stop the generic process. That completely undercuts the whole basis of the proposition that has been put by the Leader of the Opposition.The Leader of the Opposition has been saying ever since yesterday morning that you need to have special penalties to stop the lodgment of bodgie or spurious patent applications which will prevent the marketing of generic drugs. That has been the argument advanced by the Leader of the Opposition, and it shows a complete misunderstanding of how the law operates in Australia. A patent holder in this country cannot stop the marketing of a generic drug without taking action for infringement of patent.What the Leader of the Opposition has falsely alleged to the Australian public is that, as soon as you put in a patent application, that can stop the marketing of a generic drug. Wrong, I say to the Leader of the Opposition. That is a complete misunderstanding of how the law operates. That is why the amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition is unnecessary. But we also believe that the amendment proposed, as explained by the Leader of the Opposition thus far, is also potentially harmful, because it would undermine an important element of the operation of our intellectual property laws. The whole basis of the patent law is to encourage innovation, to encourage the entrepreneurial spirit, to encourage people to lodge applications for good ideas and to protect their good ideas. If you introduce the sort of change that the Leader of the Opposition is recommending, you would have a result of inhibiting many people from protecting their ideas. I do not think we should inhibit people from protecting ideas in this country. Can I simply say that, if you decide to introduce a regime of this kind for a limited number of manufacturers, why would you limit it to pharmaceutical manufacturers? Why wouldn't you extend it to other manufacturers? In the process, you would undermine a significant part of our intellectual property law, so that is the reason why the amendment would be harmful. Could I point out to the House that, when it comes to the credibility of the Labor Party on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, for 2½ years the Labor Party said the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme would be undermined if the parliament agreed to a modest increase in the patient co-contribution. Suddenly overnight, for reasons of political expediency, the Labor Party reversed that position. The stance that they are taking on this issue also goes to the question of political expediency.Seeing that we are quoting people, let me quote, from yesterday on ABC radio in Sydney, the most senior serving Labor man in Australia - that is, the Premier of New South Wales. He was asked this question by Sally Loane:Bob Carr, does the Left have any valid concerns at all? They say they're worried about the PBS, the inevitable rise in those prices and also about protecting our local acting industry. Do they have any valid concerns in your view?Carr in reply said:Not on the PBS ...In other words, Bob Carr yesterday morning was saying the whole basis of what has been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition was without justification. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition: I want the free trade agreement, the government wants the free trade agreement, but it is bad government to adopt bad policy to solve a political problem.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question and for the interest he shows in the situation in Sudan. The government has been appalled by the humanitarian and human rights disaster of Sudan. We do need to distinguish between the civil war in southern Sudan, which is nearing - we hope - settlement after 20 years, and the current emergency which is taking place in the western part of Sudan in Darfur. The Darfur crisis has left an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 people dead, and that figure comes from the United Nations. There are about 1.2 million people who have been displaced, 200,000 of those people in Chad, and the security and humanitarian situation there is still deteriorating.The government responded to the crisis in May with a $5 million contribution to humanitarian assistance, followed by a further $3 million contribution in June. Last Tuesday I announced a further $12 million in emergency humanitarian assistance. Today I can confirm that $9 million of that will go to the World Food Program and UNICEF, and the remaining funds will be channelled through other relief agencies, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, Oxfam and World Vision. These funds from Australia will provide emergency food, water supplies, sanitation and health care for the victims. I have written to Sudan's foreign minister to express Australia's deep concern about the situation. The Australian government has said on a number of occasions that we will consider requests for defence and other support that has been mandated by the United Nations Security Council.The government welcomes the Security Council resolution on Darfur which was recently passed. We lobbied hard for the resolution because strong international pressure is needed to ensure that the government of Sudan lives up to its promises. A resolution does set obligations which, if not met by Sudan's government, will be backed by not just tougher diplomatic measures but tougher economic measures as well. It is vital for the United Nations this time, late as it may be, to take a strong stand against this egregious situation. We do not want to see a failure of the United Nations in dealing with a humanitarian crisis as we saw 10 years ago in the case of Rwanda. We look to the Sudanese government to meet its obligations under the resolution. I must say that we are concerned that the head of the Sudanese army has said that he regards the resolution from the Security Council as a declaration of war. The Sudanese government should be under no illusions about the seriousness with which the international community sees this situation. It must respond quickly and it must respond meaningfully. </DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is, yes, I do recall my earlier advice to the Leader of the Opposition. The answer to the second part of the question is, yes, I am aware of the joint statement by the premiers. The answer to the interpretation placed on their stance by the Leader of the Opposition is that what he says is wrong, because the free trade agreement will not increase the price of generic drugs. The whole basis of what is being put forward by the Leader of the Opposition is wrong. It was not even the conclusion of his own trade spokesman. One of the signatories to that joint statement by the premiers today, Bob Carr, said yesterday morning that there were no grounds for concern about the PBS. So I think that what the Leader of the Opposition is doing is verballing his own Labor mates on this subject.Addressing the merits of this issue, there is no case to accept the amendment outlined by the Leader of the Opposition, because what the Leader of the Opposition is doing is making a false claim. The false claim is that the free trade agreement undermines the PBS. It does not. That was even the conclusion of Senator Conroy. What the Leader of the Opposition is proposing is an amendment based on a total misunderstanding of how the patent law of Australia operates. He is proposing an amendment that might be relevant if we were in the American Congress, where you have a completely different patent law. It might be relevant if you had automatic injunctions available, where you did have a true operation of this evergreening process. But that simply does not operate in Australia, and if the Leader of the Opposition had bothered to read the legislation, if he had bothered to read the Senate report, he might have come to that conclusion.We are opposed to the Leader of the Opposition's amendment because we think it is unnecessary. It proceeds upon a misunderstanding of the patent law in this country. We are also against it because it would harm the operation of the existing intellectual property law. It would introduce an element of uncertainty. It would discourage investment. It would discourage innovation and the creation of new ideas, which are precisely the things that this country ought to be encouraging rather than discouraging. I repeat: this government wants the free trade agreement. The free trade agreement is good for Australia, but it is bad government to adopt bad policy to solve a political problem. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question and acknowledge the member for Cowper's ongoing support for the free trade agreement with the United States. I am pleased to inform the House that the President of the United States, President Bush, overnight has signed into law the Australia-US free trade agreement in the United States. This means that every requirement for the agreement's entry into force in the United States has been met. The only remaining obstacle to the agreement's entry into force both here and in the United States is the qualified support of the Leader of the Opposition.In Australia we are now left with the farcical situation where the Leader of the Opposition is demanding an amendment to implementing legislation that is unworkable, as has just been outlined quite clearly by the Prime Minister. Members of his own party recognise that this is unnecessary. The member for Brand,  in his contribution during the debate in the parliament, argued for the agreement with no such condition. We know from media reports that the member for Griffith and Senator Sherry argued in caucus that it was not necessary. In the paper today the head of the Generic Medicines Industry Association, and head of the generic company Alphapharm, also said it is not necessary. I quote from the head of the organisation that the Labor Party purport to represent the interests of in this debate. He said:The Government has repeatedly assured us there will be no delay to the market entry of generic medicines and we believe that the legislation is consistent with this.That is from the head of the generic drug industry of Australia. It was a point picked up by Senator Conroy in his submission to caucus. In the papers today Senator Conroy is reported to have said:The Australian generics ... industry is comfortable with the FTA legislation and does not expect it will result in delays to the launch of generics.Senator Conroy is reported to have said that in caucus. Interestingly enough, a legal comment from an independent commentator from one of the country's top law firms supports this. Paul Jones from Freehill's stated:I would consider any attempt to codify patents as spurious or dodgy as completely impractical.That was said by a leading lawyer in this country. So we are left with the absurd situation where an agreement that will create 30,000 jobs in this country and deliver $6 billion to the bottom line of our economy is being held up and depends upon a dodgy amendment that has been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition. We think the real motivation here is that the Leader of the Opposition does not really believe in this and does not want it to go through. </DOC>

 - In the legislation as it exists now there are penalties in place for making false claims about holding patents. In terms of the IP legislation and the IP process that operates now, the Leader of the Opposition should take the time to come and get a briefing so that he will actually understand how it works. -  - The Leader of the Opposition is deliberately trying to confuse the process that exists in the United States, where evergreening is a problem, with the process that exists in Australia, where evergreening does not exist. It is not possible to extend the patent on a drug for an existing use. It is not possible, simply by changing the colour of the drug or putting it in a different capsule, to extend the patent on a drug - as it is in America. It is not possible to do that in Australia. Australia has some of the most rigorous patent laws in the world. The Americans, during their negotiations with us on the free trade agreement, attempted to water down those patent rules. They were completely unsuccessful.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. I know how concerned he is to protect the PBS, as is the entire government. Let me make it very clear that, as part of the free trade negotiations, this government fought long, hard and successfully to protect the position of the generic drug manufacturers here in Australia. We fought long, hard and successfully - and members opposite know it. Senator Conroy's shadow cabinet submission bears repeating. And I do repeat it for the benefit of members opposite. Senator Conroy wrote -  -  - Thanks to my good friend Alan Ramsey, I have seen the relevant section of the submission. Senator Conroy wrote:The Australian generics [drug] industry is comfortable with the FTA legislation and does not expect it will result in delays to the launch of generics.That is what Senator Conroy wrote - not about the legislation as proposed by Labor but about the legislation that this government has put into the Senate and that we now ask the Labor Party to support. But, despite knowing that we had a good agreement, the Leader of the Opposition came out yesterday and made a completely mendacious and misleading statement. He said: Our judgment is, the real concern is about the possibility of an increased number of bodgy patent applications ...Good old Senator Conroy blew him up almost immediately. The rooster struck almost immediately! There they were, standing together, Senator Conroy looking justly embarrassed by the performance of his leader. A journalist asked Senator Conroy: `Is there any evidence of bodgie patents being lodged by drug companies in Australia?' Senator Conroy said, `No, it hasn't happened here.'It has not happened here, it will not happen here and it cannot happen here. It cannot happen here because spurious patent applications are not granted. They are not granted by the Australian system. Under Australian patent law, a mere patent application cannot stop - it cannot delay, it cannot hold up - any marketing or sale of a product. Under Australian patent law, you can only get an injunction on the basis of a patent granted, not on the basis of a patent applied for. So not only is this Labor amendment unnecessary but it is positively harmful.I am advised by the patent office that every year there are some 2,400 pharmaceutical patent applications. Only 1,200 are accepted: 1,200 are not granted. You cannot distinguish between what is positively spurious and what is merely unsuccessful - you cannot make that distinction - without totally destroying the whole basis of patent law in this country and totally stifling the creativity of Australian innovators and inventors. How can we ever be a clever country if unsuccessful patent applicants face fines? How can it ever happen?What is happening here is quite clear: the Labor Party is threatening to destroy the entire free trade agreement on the basis of an unnecessary and potentially harmful amendment that has been crafted purely and simply to preserve the extraordinary vanity of the Leader of the Opposition. Truly, this man would be a danger in the Lodge.</DOC>

 - The Labor Party is suggesting that there is some additional part in terms of creating penalties for supplying information that is incorrect in relation to holding a patent. Can I assure you that the existing act already contains those provisions. The Labor Party is trying to promote a line that putting forward spurious information in a patent application process will in some way slow down the introduction of a generic. That is simply not the case.The application for patent is a completely separate process from the application process for the TGA. The TGA in Australia operates completely independently in these terms. The Labor Party is continuing to confuse it with the American system, where the Food and Drug Administration involve themselves in the resolution of patents. There are already provisions in the existing act for falsely claiming to hold patents. Those provisions will continue under the legislation. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Casey for his question. I can inform him that today the Australian Industry Group and the Commonwealth Bank released their performance of services index. The index jumped, reflecting gains in all components, including a rise in new orders, to the highest level since January 2004. That is really good for business in our community.The Commonwealth Bank Chief Economist, Michael Blythe, said that the lift in the leading components, new orders and employment highlighted the resilience of the Australian economy. He said:The economy continues to travel quite nicely. And why wouldn't it given the impressive array of positive economic fundamentals? Consumer confidence is high, incomes are rising, businesses are expanding capacity, the global economy is supportive, and the long-anticipated housing slowdown has surprised with its mildness.That is a quote from Mr Blythe, the Commonwealth Bank's Chief Economist.Underpinning the resilience of the Australian economy are a low interest rate regime with stable interest rates; strong employment, with unemployment at its lowest levels in 21 years; strong business profitability; low and locked-in inflation; and economic management which gives certainty and direction rather than jumping from disaster to disaster. All of that could be put at risk if we had someone directing economic policy who had either no experience or no stability in relation to economic policy.Although the Australian economy is running well at the moment, not all parts of the economy are doing well. For example, there are some local councils that have not done well in their management in recent years. There is one particular local council, in Sydney, that has been suspended because of its financial dealings. Although it has been claimed in this House that it was left in surplus, the audited accounts show that it was in deficit. Although it has been claimed in this House that the number of employees was reduced, payroll figures show that it was not. Although it has been claimed in this House that this was all the result of a development called the Oasis development -  - The Oasis development was no mirage! I am actually indebted to today's Bulletin for reminding us that it has not always been claimed by the member for Werriwa that he had nothing to do with the Oasis development. Back in 1999, he considered it to be a great achievement of his. He said:The new club site is part of a plan which goes back to my time as Liverpool's mayor in 1993.Since 1999, the Liverpool Oasis development has been disappearing back into the mists of history, hardly seeable by the mayor of 1991 to 1994. But in moments of candour he always comes up with the goods. He said:The new club site is part of a plan which goes back to my time as Liverpool's mayor in 1993.I would hate to be around in Australia when they look back to his time as the Australian Prime Minister. If a country goes bad you cannot suspend it and bring in a financial administrator. The government and the Prime Minister are the ultimate arbiters of economic policy. There is nobody above them. The IMF does not move in and actually take over the running of the economy: no, it would be the old mayor himself, the Liverpool mayor of 1991 to 1994, with his schemes for development and deficit and his schemes in relation to employment. If you cannot govern a council you cannot govern a country. That is why it is important that the Australian people are very familiar with the record of that mayor from 1991 to 1994. </DOC>

It can lodge good applications, it can lodge bad applications -  - it can lodge indifferent applications, but no application - not one - will stop the marketing and the sale of another product. Not one application will stop that. The only way that you can injunct a new product is on the basis of a patent granted, not a patent applied for. So the whole basis of the Labor Party's amendment is completely false and wrong.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. Regional Australia is an export powerhouse - there is no doubt about that - and that power, it has to be said, no longer rests exclusively on primary production. Rural industries have diversified enormously in recent years. It might be the case that the ALP thinks that manufacturing businesses should exist only in the city, but in fact such businesses, large and small, are spread liberally right throughout regional Australia. For example, our largest manufacturing sector, food processing, is largely based in regional Australia.In relation to the benefits of the free trade agreement, there can be no question that the benefits are very real. The removal of tariffs in the processed food and horticultural sectors will benefit these important regional employers greatly. The wine industry - a major regional industry, a major regional value-adder - will benefit very greatly by the wind-down in US tariffs. The metals and minerals export sectors, which are regionally based of course, will be more competitive with the immediate withdrawal of US duties.I will give a couple of specific examples of manufacturers in country areas, in Guyra and New England. Ruddweigh make high-technology livestock and grain weighing equipment. They use world-leading technology. They have been trying to develop a market in the US for years. When my office spoke to them recently, they were emphatic that this deal ought to be passed and passed as soon as possible because it will have a major and very positive impact on their ability to export to the United States and to develop further jobs in the country town of Guyra in New South Wales. Then there is Permadrive on the North Coast of New South Wales, around Ballina. There will be members who are familiar with this company's development of extraordinary hydraulic technology to conserve energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They have recently been faced with having to develop a subsidiary company in the US in order to satisfy American requirements with regard to enormous potential defence contracts. Under the free trade agreement they would not have to do so. They could deal directly, as though they were an American company dealing with their American market. This is potentially very important. Their market is the largest truck fleet in the world: the US military. They want the free trade agreement. They do not want an impediment to it. These examples highlight how important the free trade agreement is to rural and regional Australia. Whilst the bottom line is that the ALP in this place want to be half pregnant on this - they do not want to come one way or the other way cleanly; they cannot make up their minds - it is a reality that not only have you got strong industry support out there but there are enlightened members of the labour movement that can see it as well. I note that Bill Ludwig, the National President of the Australian Workers Union, said that it ought to be supported. He said: `Overall, you have to say yes. With a population of 300 million over there' - meaning the US - `that's not a bad market to get into.'It occurred to me that history always provides some interesting illustrations of the value of previous government actions and some insights into the sort of leadership or otherwise provided by those who were not in government. I thought it would be interesting to have a look at the Australia-Japan pact of 1957. That was pretty controversial at the time. We know now, of course, that it has been of enormous benefit to Australia, beyond the wildest dreams of those who promoted it at the time. It has been responsible for a lot of those jobs that the Minister for Trade talks about: one in five across Australia and one in four in regional Australia. I had a look at the Gallup polls of the day. They show that, despite it being only 12 years after the end of the Second World War, Australians overwhelmingly supported the Australia-Japan pact. But the interesting thing about it is that the ALP of the day at least knew where they stood: they opposed it. Dr Evatt opposed it. He was wrong - the Australian people were right - but what is to be said for it is that he displayed leadership. He did not believe in it, and he came out cleanly and said, `We don't support it.' He took a position.We are by any definition not terribly far out from the point when the Leader of the Opposition will want to portray himself as a serious contender for the leadership of this nation. I have to say to you that if you cannot make up your mind on something as basic and as obviously beneficial to the Australian community, the economy and jobs - particularly jobs in regional Australia - as the free trade agreement, you are certainly in no position to assume the leadership of the nation.</DOC>

 - The basis of the amendment is that, once an application is made, that automatically stops the generic.Opposition members - No! - They say, `No.' That is the explanation that the Leader of the Opposition has given. In the absence of his detailed amendment, the whole argument that is being used by the Leader of the Opposition is that the mere lodgment of an application is enough to interfere with the process. As the Minister for Health and Ageing pointed out, the action in relation to generics can only be taken on the basis of a patent held, not on the basis of a patent applied for. Nothing that the Leader of the Opposition has quoted to me - and I say this without even bothering to read the report -  -  - No - without bothering to read that part of the report to which the Leader of the Opposition has referred to verify that he correctly quotes it. Even accepting what he said, it does not alter the veracity of what has been said by the minister for health. You take action on the basis of a patent held or a patent granted, not a patent applied for. That is the fundamental weakness of the opposition's argument.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Canning for his question. The government does believe that the relationship with the United States is vitally important to this country. It is vitally important to our security, and not just because we have a formal treaty, the ANZUS treaty, which was entered into by a coalition government many years ago, but because when dealing with the security threats of our region the United States is a key - a fundamentally important - player. The United States is fundamental to the war against terrorism in South-East Asia; the United States is fundamental to the resolution of the problem on the Korean peninsula. The United States has been a great partner of Australia's in cooperation in dealing with those issues but also on issues such as East Timor.The government make no apology for believing very passionately that this alliance relationship is in Australia's national interest. We are proud of the way we have built the relationship up over the years from the Sydney declaration in 1996 through to, most recently, a free trade agreement between Australia and the world's largest economy, giving us such outstanding access to that economy.Are there any alternative views? There are the views about America and the American alliance so often expressed by the Leader of the Opposition. There was a debate some months ago about bringing Australian troops out of Iraq by Christmas. An American-led exercise to overthrow Saddam Hussein - an American-led exercise to help provide stability and democracy in Iraq - is one that the Leader of the Opposition off the top of his head on a radio program decided he wanted to abandon through his cut and run policy of 23 March. I concede the point that he thought that up just off the top of his head. He has had eight different policies on `troops out by Christmas' since - a total of nine `troops out by Christmas' policies since 23 March.We are seeing exactly the same phenomenon with the free trade agreement. The free trade agreement with Singapore was not questioned by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition asked no questions and showed no interest in the implications for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme of the free trade agreement with Thailand. It was of no interest - it was not even examined. I doubt whether the Leader of the Opposition has had that document in his hands. I doubt it very much. Why? Because Thailand and Singapore are not the United States of America. The reason the Leader of the Opposition has been attacking the free trade agreement with the United States of America is that it is with America. He has had four different positions on this issue. He was against it in February. He said it was not a free trade agreement in July. We thought he was going to support it two or three days ago. Then he came up with his sham amendments in order to provide the opportunity of rejecting it. The fact is that the common themes here are twofold. The first is the visceral anti-Americanism of the Leader of the Opposition and many, but not all, in his own party. That comes through over and over again. The second is policy on the run. On the pharmaceutical issue, the Leader of the Opposition has made up the policy overnight without having any understanding of Australian patents law, and he is now trying to work out how he is going to defend his policy. He has absolutely no understanding of how the existing law would work in the first place and no understanding of what the consequences of his amendments would be. They would destroy innovation in this country. People simply would not lodge applications for patents if those applications, on failing, were to incur a financial penalty. It just has not been thought through. The Leader of the Opposition has no idea. It is yet another example of his wild and erratic policy ride and making things up on the run, all of which is built on the foundation of a visceral anti-Americanism - a very dangerous formula for somebody who one day wishes to become the Prime Minister of this country.</DOC>

 - Oh dear, oh dear! I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. In dealing with this issue, the first thing that needs to be asked is the threshold question. This question, which I put to every member of the Australian Labor Party, is: does the Australian Labor Party believe that foreign students should have greater rights in Australian universities than Australian citizens? As to the answer the Labor Party puts up to that question, in its policy the Labor Party is saying that the 136,000 foreign students in Australian universities have greater rights to access Australian universities than Australian citizens. The fact is that this government is expanding the number of HECS places, where the taxpayer pays for three-quarters of the cost of the university education, by 36,000 over the next four years. That will support 50,000 students. So the number of HECS places is expanding.  - What this government said in 1997, when the member for Goldstein was in this position doing an outstanding job, was that we believed that an Australian citizen who met the minimum academic entry score but missed out on a HECS place should be just as eligible to take up a fee paying place in an Australian university as a student from Beijing or Jakarta. If we look at medicine, we see that right across Australia there are 530,000 undergraduates in Australian universities. Today there are 11,000 Australians paying their own way. They have academic scores of 99 or 98 and they missed out on a HECS place. The price they pay for that is not getting a public subsidy, a taxpayer subsidy. But they are paying their own way. What this government has said is that, from next year, every student who is offered a fee paying place for the first time will be offered a loan from the Australian taxpayer - a HECS style loan, for which the government funds the university - and the student, rich or poor, does not have to pay a cent back until they are working and earning in excess of $36,000 a year. There are 784 courses in this country where full fee paying places are offered. There are only 16 courses enrolling 300 students that cost anywhere near $100,000. If medicine costs $200,000 for a full fee payer, it just goes to show how much public subsidy is in a publicly subsidised place. - I think the Australian Financial Review today made some observations about not only Labor's policy but also the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Labor's spokesman for education. It is well known that this government, in schooling, are driving national consistency in standards, in professional teacher training and in reporting to parents in plain language. The government have said that in order for schools to get money we want parents to get plain language reports about the progress of students - their children. So the Australian Financial Review, under the heading `Macklin flunks the policy test', delivered the report on the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It said:Ms Macklin is ... an obstacle to progress in education.I could not have said it better, because the Labor Party is saying to Australian students who miss out on the expanded number of HECS places that the only way that you can pay your own way through an Australian university is to go overseas, sell your passport and come back as a foreigner. That is an outrageous proposition - to deny Australians access to their own institutions. To show how ridiculous it is, the University of Ballarat, which up until recently had a policy of not accepting Australian fee-paying students, had to reverse its policy. Do you know why it had to reverse its policy? Because it discovered that it had six Australians pretending to be foreigners who were paying full fees and doing exceedingly well. That is the kind of Australia we would have under an inconsistent, erratic and inexperienced leader such as the Leader of the Opposition, and the report card on his deputy has already been delivered.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to give the House some advice about the enormous benefits to Australian farmers flowing from the free trade agreement. As a member who represents a lot of beef and dairy producers, the member for Page would be eagerly looking forward to some of those benefits starting to flow to Australian farmers from 1 January next year. It is not some time far off in the distance; these benefits can flow immediately. For instance, for beef producers the tariff on in-quota deliveries of beef - and that is nearly all of our exports - is lifted entirely, immediately. So there will be significant benefits there from day one. Indeed, as the quota grows over the years, the benefits to the industry also expand. It has been estimated that there are about $3 billion worth of additional benefits for Australian beef producers over the first 20 years of this agreement.Benefits to the dairy industry are estimated at about $1½ billion over that period - very substantial amounts indeed. The tariff on wool is eliminated over four years. The tariffs on lamb and mutton all go, most of them immediately and others over four years. The tariff on wine exports is eliminated over 11 years. That is worth about $38 million a year to this wonderful Australian industry. And of course there will be immediate tariff reductions on a whole range of horticultural products, immediate elimination of the tariff on cotton seeds, elimination also of tariffs on seafood, wheat and grain products and a whole range of other agricultural produce - enormous benefits, immediately.It is amazing, therefore, that there has not been a demand, particularly from the shadow minister for agriculture - who I notice is missing - that the Labor Party support this free trade agreement immediately. This is something that can deliver billions of dollars of benefits to Australian agriculture, and no-one opposite is demanding that the Leader of the Opposition get out of the way and allow this package of legislation to pass. It is high time the spurious amendments proposed by the Leader of the Opposition be put aside so that these benefits can flow immediately to farmers. This offers potentially the biggest boost in farm incomes from any trade measure that we have been able to undertake in generations. As the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned a few moments ago, it can be compared with the breakthroughs that occurred as a result of the arrangements with Japan. Here is a wonderful new opportunity, and it is time the Leader of the Opposition got out of the way and allowed farmers to start reaping the benefits.</DOC>

 - If the Labor Party has a very strong view that the only way that any person should get into an Australian university is on merit alone, what is the Labor Party then going to do about the 15 per cent of students this year - about 40,000 - who got a HECS place but who did not actually meet the HECS cut-off? Does the Labor Party not understand that there are students educated in difficult circumstances throughout this country that the universities give a leg up to, in terms of their entry scores, to give them a HECS place? The Labor Party has no trouble with that; neither do I.  - The government have no trouble with that either. But why should an Australian student from, say, Ballarat or Bendigo, who gets an entry score of 99.3 and does not get a HECS place in law at the University of Melbourne, see a student from Beijing, Jakarta or Thailand walk in the door to that university? The Labor Party's attitude here is that in some way Australians have fewer rights in their universities. Despite the fact that they work hard and their parents pay taxes, the Labor Party says they have fewer rights. The Labor Party is also seeking, in this and a number of areas, to falsely mislead Australians into thinking that what the government are doing is reducing HECS places and replacing them with fee-paying places. In fact the reality is that, at a cost of $2½ billion to Australian taxpayers - many of whom have never seen the inside of a university - we are expanding HECS places by 36,000 over four years and then saying to the students of Australia, `If you work hard and the opportunity is offered to be a fee-paying student, not only do you have the right of choice if you want to take it up but for the first time a loan will be available.'The Labor Party have a problem with two things. Firstly, they think that anybody who pays for anything, paying for their own way in life, should have their rights denied and, secondly, they are opposed to the idea of Australians having at least the same rights in Australian universities as foreigners. Those students who enter Australian universities over the next four years, paying their own way, are all - every single one of them - in addition to the students who are in the expanded HECS places. The Leader of the Opposition must have somewhat of a hard heart when he reads the Australian Financial Review. It advises him to shift his education spokesperson, if he becomes - God help us - the Prime Minister of Australia. As the Financial Review points out today, `Macklin flunks the policy test' in two areas: firstly, by giving more rights to international students than Australians and, secondly, by denying Australians in a democratic country the right to pay for something that will benefit not just them but the rest of the country. If that is the kind of madness that we are going to have under a Labor government, we should work even harder to stop it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question, because the issue of terrorism is a matter that the government take very seriously, particularly their responsibility to protect the safety, the right to life and the security of the Australian population. We seek to protect Australia against terrorist attack, and we are committed to ensuring that every possible measure is in place to deal with that threat. The Anti-terrorism Act 2004, which commenced on 30 June, and the counter-terrorism bills currently before the parliament provide a package of measures that further strengthen our commitment to fight terrorists. That is a claim that the opposition often seeks to make for itself. We do have another bill - the Anti-terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2004 - which received a third reading in this House in June. This bill introduces a new offence of associating with terrorist organisations. Under its provisions, it would be an offence to intentionally associate with a person who is a member of a listed terrorist organisation or who promotes or directs the activities of a listed terrorist organisation, where that association provides support that would help the terrorist organisation continue to exist or expand. The fact is that terrorist organisations depend upon contact and integration with the community as a whole in order to survive and expand. This bill seeks to cut off this source of support to such organisations, particularly those organisations that engage in terror from behind the veil of the broader community. We want to make it an illegal association if people are giving de facto support to them.Instead of passing this important legislation, the opposition has said, `We want to see delay. We want to see it dealt with by months of process through a Senate committee.' I drew attention earlier today to some comments from the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, because Mick Keelty said recently that the police need to be able to disrupt and prevent terrorism at the earliest intervention point.Consorting, as this is, is not a new concept. In law enforcement terms, it is used extensively around Australia now. I think there is only one state where an offence of this sort - consorting - is not known to the law. It should not require a Senate committee to tell the Labor Party that this is in the interests of Australia. I call upon the Leader of the Opposition to have his colleagues stop the obstruction and pass this important piece of legislation during this two-week sitting period.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canberra for her question, and I welcome her back to the House after her absence. Prime Life is a publicly listed corporation. It has made numerous announcements that have been reported in the media over recent months about the proposed restructuring of its business and financial undertakings. As I understand from media reports, it is currently in negotiations with ASIC in relation to a proposed restructuring and capital raising.In relation to the moneys paid to Prime Life as an approved provider, all approved providers that receive subsidised care from the Australian government received a one-off capital payment prior to 30 June of half a billion dollars. That has been made subject to certain conditions, including the approval of the Department of Health and Ageing as to where those funds are directed. In fact, those funds are to be directed to specific areas, including fire and safety standards and the meeting of the 2008 certification standards. Those and other requirements have been set out in letters to all providers. So the Department of Health and Ageing, as it does with all other providers, is monitoring the use of those funds. </DOC>

 - I indicated that, as the proposal by the Leader of the Opposition did not alter the substance of the local content rules, we had no difficulty with that proposal. It did not work any kind of harmful effects. I am told that the amendment has been drafted and has in fact been lodged with the table office in the Senate. But I do not control the table office in the Senate. -  - I certainly do not. If people want to inquire, that is fine. But while I am on my feet there is another amendment that I am a lot more interested in, and that is the amendment that the Leader of the Opposition has talked about in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Most of my attention on this issue this morning was focused on the interview that the Leader of the Opposition gave on the Today show. I have been busily comparing what he said this morning with what he said on Tuesday when he announced the Labor Party's policy on the free trade agreement, and I find a very interesting contrast.I find that on Tuesday the Leader of the Opposition was saying that what we ought to have were penalties for failed patent applications, for bad patent applications. The whole basis of everything that the Leader of the Opposition was saying on Tuesday was that there was concern about the possibility of an increased number of bodgie patent applications. He said: `We want an amendment to go through the Senate to ensure we deal with this problem and that we eliminate the possibility of these bodgie patent applications in Australia holding up the introduction of cheaper generic drugs.' That is very interesting. I am reading from the press release that was made by the Leader of the Opposition. He said that Labor will fight for amendments to:Protect the PBS by preventing and penalising drug companies that try to stop cheaper generic drugs coming onto the market by lodging dodgy patent claims.We have already pointed out - and maybe by this morning the Leader of the Opposition, having spoken to the Labor Party's lawyers, had been advised that we were right - that it is not possible to stop generics by lodging a dodgy patent claim because, as the Leader of the Opposition now apparently knows, the Australian law operates very differently from the American law where, if you lodge an application, you get automatic entitlements. Under the Australian law, you do not achieve anything if you lodge an application for a patent. You cannot, as the Leader of the Opposition was wrongly saying on Tuesday, secure the stopping of generic drugs simply by lodging an application. The whole proposition that the Leader of the Opposition was putting on Tuesday was not properly thought through. It was another example of the Leader of the Opposition making up policy on the run. The government quite properly have said that we are not willing to support an amendment that imposes a penalty in relation to an application for a patent. There are something like 24,000 patent applications lodged every year, and about 50 per cent of those are culled on first blush by the patent office.What the Leader of the Opposition demonstrated on Tuesday was that he had absolutely no understanding of how the patent law in this country operates. Once again, it was the Leader of the Opposition making up policy on the run and putting forward a proposition. Any reasonable interpretation of what the Leader of the Opposition said - both in his joint statement with Senator Conroy and also in his very lengthy news conference - is that he was proposing an amendment that would apply a penalty in relation to a patent application. But, fast forward to this morning, and on the Today show - apparently informed now by people who understand a little bit about this within the Labor Party - he is now not talking about applications; he is talking about litigation. He is talking about court applications. He has totally changed his ground.What is he talking about here? He is talking about a big company that is trying to stop the generic product getting onto the market. They take legal action and these things are determined in the courts. We are not talking anymore about dodgy applications. No, we are not. We are talking about the Leader of the Opposition having taken two days to find out how the patent laws of this country operate.I say to the Leader of the Opposition that it is about time he told the Australian public which amendment he has in mind. Does he have an amendment dealing with patent applications? Does he propose to impose a penalty on people who make applications that they shouldn't or is he talking about some amendment in relation to the court action that might be taken by a patent holder against a generic manufacturer? We still do not have the amendment. It is two days since the announcement was made. The Leader of the Opposition made it up on the run at his news conference on Tuesday. He is now in a position where this morning he has very seriously shifted his ground. I think the Leader of the Opposition owes the Australian public an explanation. What amendment does he really want? - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question and acknowledge his support for the quick passage of the enabling legislation for the free trade agreement with the United States through both houses of the parliament. He knows, as do all other members of the government, that this agreement offers 30,000 new jobs in our economy. A $6 billion benefit to the bottom line in our economy has been indicated by independent analysis of this agreement. - On the basis of those facts, the agreement is widely supported across the Australian community. We have seen that from both sides of politics across the Australian community, particularly from state Labor premiers. They have been behind this agreement and have worked with the government in pursuing this for quite some time. We should note that when the enabling legislation passed through the House of Representatives, I think about six weeks ago, it was supported by 14 members of the Australian Labor Party. They voted in the affirmative for the enabling legislation for this agreement and actually crossed the floor and came and sat over here when a division was called. I think you will recall that, Mr Speaker.We should look at who crossed the floor. Two of the members who crossed the floor from the Labor Party were the opposition spokesperson for health and the opposition spokesman for industry. They are the two people in the Australian Labor Party who have the core responsibility in a policy sense for the issues that have been debated this week: the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the Patents Act. Both those members of the Labor Party voted for the government's legislation six weeks ago in the House without a murmur about the issues that the Leader of the Opposition has raised this week. - It is recorded in the Hansard who voted for the legislation. - That was done without raising these amendments then, without raising the concerns about these specific issues then, and the Labor Party supported it in this House. But by Tuesday they had both shifted their position after the caucus meeting and had jumped on the Leader of the Opposition's roller-coaster ride of policy on the run. As we have seen, it is a hallmark of the Leader of the Opposition - policy on the run. They jumped on board and they were with him. It was interesting to note that the Sydney Morning Herald this week, reporting on that caucus meeting, quoted Senator Conroy's submission that he took to caucus. In talking about the ALP's proposed amendment on this issue, he said that it was subject to legal advice. He said:Legal advice is being obtained ... Subject to that advice, Labor will insist on the amendment. But did the Leader of the Opposition wait for that advice? No. They raced straight out and announced what they were expecting the government to do. They raced straight out and suggested the amendments that they thought should be put in place. He was conjuring up a problem and a solution at the same time - a problem that does not exist. He first insisted that this alleged problem could be fixed through the patent application process. By this morning, on the Today program on TV, he was suggesting that it is the job of the courts to fix it. From Tuesday to today the emphasis of that remedy has made a big shift. Again, it is an indication of the Leader of the Opposition making policy on the run then playing catch-up in terms of how this could be implemented through the legal process. The question the Leader of the Opposition should be answering is: why didn't he get the legal advice first? Why did he say on television this morning, `The lawyers are out there doing the work on it and now we're finding out'? Over the last five months why hasn't the Leader of the Opposition sought or received a briefing from DFAT on the FTA? Why hasn't he sought to get that clarified? Again, the Leader of the Opposition has been caught out making policy on the run, and that is no way to be a leader of this country.</DOC>

 - I get a lot of representations from a lot of people, and I can tell you this: the business community of Australia has been a supporter of the free trade agreement for much longer than the Leader of the Opposition. What we want, and what the business community wants, is to know exactly what the form of the opposition's amendment is. What are you trying to do? Are you trying to do what you said on Tuesday? I tell you what: putting representations aside, I have obtained some advice. - I have received advice from five departments of state - the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Health and Ageing, the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources, and the Attorney-General's Department. They have told the government, `We do not believe a legislative amendment to deliver on the opposition's stated policy can be drafted.' That is the advice that I have received and that my colleagues have received. The stated policy that they were referring to was the policy enunciated on Tuesday by the Leader of the Opposition - the policy where he talked about the bodgie applications. That was the policy that he had alighted upon before he was properly informed by the Labor lawyers as to how the patent system operated.All I can say to the Leader of the Opposition is that our advice from five departments is that you cannot draft an effective amendment to give purpose and point to what the Leader of the Opposition said on Tuesday. If the Leader of the Opposition has some other proposal maybe he will inform us, but the stated policy of the opposition is not one that we will accept. We will not support an amendment that imposes penalties in relation to patent applications. We will not support that. It is not only unnecessary and unworkable but also potentially very damaging to the operation of our patent laws. It remains our very strong view that, if a change like that were introduced, it would inhibit innovation, it would reduce the generation of new ideas and it would work against the interests of the sound intellectual property law that we have in this country. I simply say to the Leader of the Opposition on the policy that he enunciated on Tuesday: an amendment along those lines remains quite unacceptable to the government for the reasons that I have stated. On the advice that we have from five departments of state, you cannot draft a workable amendment in relation to that. We do not believe, despite our strong support for the free trade agreement, that it is good government to accept bad policy to solve a political problem. We do not intend to accept an amendment along the lines outlined by the Leader of the Opposition on Tuesday.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Macarthur. I do not think anyone would doubt that he has a commonsense understanding of the importance of the American alliance and how valuable that is to Australia. He has taught himself a bit about it, he has had a bit of briefing and he has understood the issue. - As the minister says, that is a contrast. The government will indeed continue to build its relationship with the United States through cooperation on a strategic, an economic and also a people-to-people basis. It is important that we do so. We will also continue to build our economic links with the world's largest economy - the economy in the world which has the strongest record in terms of innovation, research and development. It is very important that we strengthen those relations.As to whether there are any alternative views, I have said it before: the Leader of the Opposition is viscerally anti-American. When there is an issue that involves America, there is always a controversy - not when we have a free trade agreement with Thailand or Singapore; that is all fine. The Leader of the Opposition has never even looked at those free trade agreements. When it comes to America, his knee-jerk reaction was that he was against it. That is what he said in February last year.I pointed out yesterday that the Leader of the Opposition has had nine different positions on `troops out by Christmas' because he makes it all up on the run. His erratic style and his dangerous approach to policy making has led to nine different positions on `troops out by Christmas'. Yesterday I said that he had had four different positions on the free trade agreement with the United States. That was yesterday. This morning the Today program went to air with Tracy Grimshaw and the Leader of the Opposition. Out came the fifth different position on the free trade agreement with the United States! On Tuesday the Leader of the Opposition wanted amendments, including in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. He said that he wanted bodgie patent claims to be penalised - in other words, all patent claim applications that are rejected get fined. Nobody thinks this is a good idea. All of the benefits from the free trade agreement for agriculture, manufacturing and our services sector as well as access to $200 billion worth of federal government procurement in the US would be lost because anybody who makes an application for a patent which gets rejected should be hit with a fine. I think that is a very good example of loose, dangerous and erratic policy making. As the Prime Minister has said, somebody has spoken to the Leader of the Opposition since then and said: `Mate, I don't think you quite understand this' - by the way, the stare is back - `I don't think you quite understand the facts here. I don't think you've quite got it. Let's see if we can adjust our position so that it makes a bit more sense.' So today he comes out with a new position. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition is just making stuff up on the run.You wonder where he gets these ideas from. Some people say that he gets these ideas from Google searches on the Internet. Where would you go to, what site would you go for, to find out where the Leader of the Opposition is getting his ideas from? Take these two quotes - political advice from somebody in the United States:... curb the appeals process which permits drug companies to delay their introduction - of generics - onto the market ...That was political advice to Senator John Kerry. And some other political advice came to Senator Kerry just before the US Democratic convention:... Kerry and his convention have four nights to convince America that ... the prescription drug benefit is inadequate ...And who said these things? Yes, Dick Morris. So the Leader of the Opposition googles Uncle Dick to find out what his policy should be, runs out and has a press conference and says, `Haven't I got a great policy for you,' and then somebody comes to him and says, `Mate, it doesn't work like that in Australia; that's how it works in America. You've mucked it all up.' And he comes back today and goes on the Today program with a completely new yarn. This Leader of the Opposition is a dangerous man and he is an extremely erratic leader.</DOC>

 - I rhetorically ask the Leader of the Opposition: isn't it about time you told us which amendment you want? - That is your difficulty. On Tuesday, it was an amendment about patent applications. - By Thursday morning, no doubt instructed by lawyers for Labor, you had had a bit of a fast reading course on the patent law of this country, and you had been told -  - By Thursday morning, the Leader of the Opposition, having received a bit of advice on how the patent laws of this country operate, realised that what he proposed on Tuesday would do enormous damage to the intellectual property system in this country. And that is the reason why I indicated that not only was that amendment unnecessary but it was positively harmful. There are two reasons why such an amendment remains unacceptable to the government: it is unnecessary and, on the advice of five departments of state, it is unworkable. In addition to that, it is clear on any examination of how our intellectual property system operates that, if you impose penalties in relation to failed patent applications, you will undermine the free operation of the whole patent system. That is not a price that this government is prepared to pay, because that goes to economic stability -  - it goes to economic predictability and it goes to the certainty of the investment climate. This is yet another example of the Leader of the Opposition not thinking things through. He grabs hold of an idea and he says to himself, `It would be a great idea to have an amendment about the PBS.' So, instead of trying to learn how the patent system operates, the Leader of the Opposition says, `You know what we'll propose? We'll propose a penalty' - to use his own language - `on dodgy patent applications,' without knowing that if you did that you would potentially cripple the whole intellectual property system. That is exactly what the Leader of the Opposition has done. Now he realises it - he realised it this morning - and if you read through the transcript from this morning he does not tell Tracy about any of these dodgy applications. - By this morning he had shifted his ground. He is now talking about court proceedings being taken by the holders of patents against generic manufacturers. He has finally learnt something that we put to him a couple of days ago - that is, that you cannot in this country under our law take legal proceedings against a generic manufacturer on the basis of a patent applied for; you can only take them on the basis of a patent granted. So when the Leader of the Opposition talks about Labor's amendment, I ask him: which amendment? When anybody else talks about Labor's amendment, whether he is an officer of the AMA or indeed any other organisation, I might ask: what Labor amendment? I again ask rhetorically of the Leader of the Opposition: will you please let us have your amendment? We have looked at the two, and I would be delighted to see it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question, and I admire her determination, which the government totally share, to protect the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme of this country. Let me make it very clear that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has been protected by this government and Labor knows it. We have protected the PBS and Labor knows it. Not only did Senator Conroy tell the shadow cabinet that the government's free trade negotiation protected the position of the generic manufacturers and not only did Senator Conroy announce at a press conference that the process known as patent evergreening did not take place in this country but Senator Conroy on Monday even complimented the government on how we had stood up to the American pharmaceutical manufacturers. Yes, this particular rooster crowed three times, and he crowed three times on the government's behalf. Let me quote Senator Conroy, `The government resisted the Americans' ambition on the PBS.' For the record, let me repeat that. Senator Conroy, on the government's conduct of the free trade agreement negotiations, said, `The government resisted the Americans' ambition on the PBS.' But all that was on Monday before the Leader of the Opposition had his little brain explosion and decided that it was absolutely necessary to ban dodgy patent applications to protect the PBS, even though a mere application does not ground any rights whatsoever under Australian patent law. This was yet another example of the Leader of the Opposition doing his talking first and his thinking later - another example of the Leader of the Opposition announcing policy and only doing the research subsequently.Yesterday the Labor Party were asked to name an expert who backs Labor's position on this amendment to the free trade agreement enabling legislation, and they came up with Professor Peter Drahos of the ANU. When Professor Drahos was asked what he thought of the ALP's proposal, he said:Have they actually drafted something?All I've heard them using is the word 'evergreening'.It shows how little homework the Labor Party has done that it has taken them this long to stumble across the concept.That is Labor's friend! But he did not stop there. He did not stop at the 7.30 Report; he talked to the Age as well. On the Labor Party's policy, he said to the Age:... it's a joke. It's window dressing.And he was not content with that. On PM he said of the Labor Party's policy:... it has all the hallmarks of policy on the run.Labor's policy is completely unworkable because it destroys the whole basis of patent law in this country. How can we ever have a clever country if unsuccessful patent applicants face massive fines? Every year there are some 22,000 patent applications in this country and 50 per cent are unsuccessful initially. That is some 11,000 entities - entities no doubt employing tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of Australians - all of whom would be liable for massive fines if the Labor Party's unnecessary and harmful proposal were ever put into practice.Let us be clear about this: Labor's proposal could be used against Australians just as easily as it could be used against Americans. If the Labor Party's proposal were ever to become law, Ralph Sarich would not have got a patent; he would have got a $40 million fine. That is the absolute insanity of the Labor Party's proposal. Opposition members like to talk about their leader as `crazy brave'. They used to talk about Doc Evatt in the same way. On the evidence this week, they are only half right.</DOC>

 - I might rhetorically ask, yet again: which plan - the plan enunciated on Tuesday or the plan towards which the Leader of the Opposition was rapidly moving this morning? I do not think the Leader of the Opposition knows. The opposition may have tabled an amendment in relation to the local content rules, but I have not seen any amendment in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. What the Leader of the Opposition was talking about on Tuesday was a vastly different thing from what he started to talk about this morning on the Today program. There is a mile of difference between clobbering people who put in patent applications that fail and talking about the legal action that a patent holder might take against a generic manufacturer.What I can tell the House is simply this: nothing in the free trade negotiations has weakened the protections of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme - absolutely nothing. That was the view of Senator Conroy. I can acknowledge that there is concern and support in the Australian community for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. That is why the government were resolute in our determination during the negotiations not to concede anything, and we have not conceded anything. In fact, in one important respect we have increased the protections because we have expanded the grounds on which patent applications can be opposed. In that respect we have made the protections even stronger. So I say to the Leader of the Opposition again, rhetorically: when you ask me about Labor's amendment, would you please preface that question by telling me which amendment? Are you talking about the amendment that you enunciated on Tuesday that would effectively cripple the operation of our patents scheme -  - or are you talking about the amendment that you were creeping towards on the Today show this morning, which was an amendment dealing with something entirely different? There is a world of difference between the Leader of the Opposition on this issue on Tuesday and the Leader of the Opposition on this issue this morning. I think the Leader of the Opposition owes the Australian public an explanation about which amendment he speaks of when he asks me questions.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question and acknowledge the very strong work that he does in terms of promoting innovation both in his electorate and through the committee he chairs. He knows that innovation is the cornerstone of our competitive economy, and the cornerstone of innovation is patents. We have a very robust patent system in Australia - in fact, one of the most robust patent systems in the world. The system that we have in place now already weeds out and rejects spurious and invalid claims in the lodgment of patents. None of that system - I repeat: none of that system - has been changed in the transition to the FTA.I am asked by the member for Eden-Monaro whether there are any threats to the current patent system. There are, and they are coming from the opposition, who are putting forward ill-considered changes to our patent regime which will introduce penalties for those people who want to innovate, for those people who want to be inventive, for those people who want to show their ability in terms of taking Australia forward. The Labor Party amendment, as we think it is - not that we know, Prime Minister - relates to what the Leader of the Opposition was talking about on Tuesday when he talked about amending patents. The amendment that the Labor Party is proposing will damage our IP system irrevocably. That is not just my opinion and not just the opinion of those people who understand patent law but the opinion of the keeper of intellectual property in Australia, IP Australia. We have heard all sorts of experts being quoted, hither and thither, about IP law. IP Australia administer the law and understand it better than anyone else. I asked the Director General of IP Australia to give me and the government an opinion on the proposal we thought that Labor was going to progress following the press conference of the Leader of the Opposition on Tuesday. This is the response from the director general, Ian Heath. I will quote only parts of it, but I will table the whole letter. Dr Heath says:We do not believe that a Legislative amendment to deliver this outcome - that is, the outcome defined on Tuesday by the Leader of the Opposition - could be drafted without undermining the basis of patent law and examination practice.The letter goes on. Further down the letter, Dr Heath says:However, to introduce penalties for making such claims in the first place would undermine the system.I table that letter. What we have here from the Leader of the Opposition is a series of policies on the run. We do not actually understand - because he does not understand patent law - what he is asking for. At Tuesday's press conference he talked about `bodgie patent applications'. He said that bodgie patent applications are evergreening. I have news for the Leader of the Opposition: applying for a new patent is not evergreening. Applying for a patent for a new use is not evergreening; it is part of an established patent system. Senator Conroy agrees with that, because at the press conference on Tuesday with the Leader of the Opposition he said that evergreening does not occur in Australia. Evergreening does not occur in Australia, but applying for new patents for new uses does, and that is not evergreening.By Tuesday night the Leader of the Opposition had sort of expanded it a bit to `refine financial penalties for drug companies that do a bodgie patent'. You do not do a bodgie patent in Australia. We have IP Australia to prevent that. Then yesterday the Leader of the Opposition actually started to mix up the acts that govern this whole issue. He pretended to be quoting from the Patents Act when he asked me a question about certificating patents when he was actually quoting from the Therapeutic Goods Act. No wonder that, at the first instance, I could not understand where the question was coming from. It highlights that the Leader of the Opposition has got absolutely no idea what he is talking about.This morning I sat in my pyjamas and watched Tracy Grimshaw asking him questions, and I thought, `The Leader of the Opposition has got no idea what he is talking about, but he has moved away from trying to amend patent law to trying to amend court process in the instance of an injunction.' - We want to know where the Leader of the Opposition is coming from. Put out your amendments so that we understand, so that Australia understands, what it is you are trying to change. Are you trying to change intellectual property law in Australia? If you are, show us your amendment. If you are trying to change court process, show us your amendment. This is just another series of mistakes by the Leader of the Opposition to add to a long catalogue of mistakes during his term as opposition leader.</DOC>

 - I am aware of both of those statements and, as usual, the Deputy Prime Minister was absolutely right. He said the Prime Minister and others would be having something to say - and you have been hearing it for the last 30 minutes. Can I take the opportunity while I am on my feet to draw the attention of the House, and particularly the Leader of the Opposition, to a statement that has been released today by IP Owners, which is the Intellectual Property Owners Association of Australia. I think it would have been a good thing, in a way, if the Leader of the Opposition had consulted this organisation before he made his rather unfortunate pronouncements on Tuesday about amending the law of this country. The statement says: `The Intellectual Property Owners Association of Australia is a not-for-profit organisation that represents the interests of all owners of intellectual property in Australia by dealing with IP issues from the owners' perspective,' and so forth.I would have thought that intellectual property is a very valuable asset of the Australian people. I would have thought that one of the things we want for the future of this country is to have an intellectual property regime that encourages people to think up new ideas, that encourages the entrepreneurial spirit and that encourages innovation. The IP Owners Association makes it very clear that it disagrees with the Labor Party proposal about spurious patent claims, which is what the Leader of the Opposition enunciated on Tuesday.The Leader of the Opposition keeps asking us whether we are going to support Labor's amendment. Labor's amendment as outlined on Tuesday - the amendment on which I have obtained the advice of five departments of state - was that you were going to impose a penalty on a failed patent application. That was spelt out very clearly by the Leader of the Opposition. Let me read again from his press statement, in which he said there is:... concern ... about the possibility of increased number of bodgie patent applications.That can only mean one thing: a patent application. It does not mean a bodgie court procedure; it means a bodgie patent application. In making that recommendation, the Leader of the Opposition was drawing directly on recommendation 25 of the Labor members of the Senate committee. I say again to the Leader of the Opposition: when he asks me questions about the government's attitude to Labor's amendment, will he please in future tell me which amendment he is referring to? Is he referring to the amendment that he outlined on Tuesday and which has been branded by five departments of state as unworkable? It has been rejected by the Director General of Intellectual Property. It has been rejected by the IP Owners Association. It has been branded by anybody who understands the operation of patent law in this country as completely unworkable. Or is he talking about some other amendment? Would the Leader of the Opposition please enlighten the Australian public.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dickson for his question. I inform the House that on Wednesday of this week world oil prices reached an all-time record of $44.15 per barrel. Since then, the world oil price has come off a little to $43. But that is a 35 per cent increase in price since this time last year and oil prices have increased by 12 per cent in the last month alone.The increase in the world oil price has been a result of both supply and demand factors. In relation to demand, the recovery of the US economy has had an effect and so has the emergence of China. Between 1997 and 2003, world demand increased by 5.8 million barrels per day and China accounted for around 40 per cent of that increase. The estimates of additional capacity in the world are that there is only about one per cent of global consumption as spare capacity, indicating that there is little room for manoeuvre in the face of this very strong demand for oil. As the House would be aware, events in the Middle East, unrest in Nigeria and speculation on Russia's largest oil exporters are also contributing to price pressures.The IMF and the OECD estimate that a sustained $US10 per barrel increase in the price of oil results in the OECD area as a whole losing 0.4 per cent of GDP. So the rise of $12 per barrel over the last year alone would lead us to believe that maybe half a percentage point of global GDP could have been lost. Undoubtedly, that will have an effect on Australia. If the world grows slower, then our exports will be affected and that would have an effect back in Australia.I should also comment on the revenue effects in relation to this. The Commonwealth's tax on petrol is a flat excise. It does not move as the petrol price moves. It is 38c a litre. It was actually 44c a litre before this government cut it and if the indexation arrangements had continued it would be substantially more than that. -  - But 38c a litre -  - It was the member for Hotham who actually criticised the abolition of indexation. I just thought he was perhaps renewing his objection to the abolition of indexation. I can assure you that, if the member for Hotham had had his way, the excise on petrol would be around 5c a litre higher than it is today. I think the people of Australia would like to know where the Australian Labor Party stands in relation to this. I will say this: the Leader of the Opposition promised Labor's tax policy 12 weeks ago, on the Thursday after the budget. He said that there would be a tax policy, and it has not been released as yet.  - As I pointed out, the excise does not move and in fact is considerably lower than the Australian Labor Party would like it. I also indicate that, because GST is a value added tax, GST does move in relation to value. But every last dollar of GST goes to the eight state and territory Labor governments, who now have a windfall of $1.6 billion.I was a bit surprised that there is at least one Labor member calling for a variable GST. The member for Bass believes that the rate of GST on petrol should move up and down in relation to the petrol price. So it would be 10 per cent on everything else, and it could be nine per cent or eight per cent on petrol. It would vary presumably from day to day or month to month, massively complicating the system. The last person to call for variable GST rates was the member for Werriwa, who wanted a geographic GST, which would be one rate on one side of the road and another on the other. I point out that not only would that be a massively complicated system to introduce but, of course, the people who would receive less under such a system would have to be the state Labor governments and territories. If the state Labor governments and territories are prepared to vary the GST rate downwards on petrol, they may not be getting the windfall of $1.6 billion, but there would be no effect whatsoever in relation to the Commonwealth, which does not collect any of that revenue.I advise the member for Bass to look a little more carefully at the taxation system. And I advise the member for Werriwa not to hide from the Australian people his tax policy, which is now 12 weeks late, but to come clean with the Australian people and let them in on the secret so that they can adequately scrutinise Labor's plans, which invariably will amount to a detraction from the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - The question of whether the free trade agreement passes through the parliament by the end of either this week or next week is not in my hands. It is not in the hands of the parliamentary secretary; it is in the hands of the parliament and, indeed, in the hands of the Senate. I simply say to the Leader of the Opposition that he raised on Tuesday a proposal that there should be an amendment purportedly to protect the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We do not believe that such an amendment is necessary but, furthermore, we believe the particular amendment he canvassed on Tuesday, which was to introduce penalties for failed patent applications, would undermine the intellectual property system of this country.We have demonstrated that today with the letter from the Director General of Intellectual Property, the statement I referred to from the IP Owners Association and the reference to numerous statements by intellectual property lawyers. Even the nominated academic of the Leader of the Opposition in relation to these matters, Professor Drahos, has indicated that the proposal that the Leader of the Opposition put forward on Tuesday is doubly objectionable: it is unnecessary and unworkable and, in addition to that, it would be positively harmful. We are not prepared to accept an amendment that has both of those defects. We are not prepared to accept an amendment that is not only unnecessary and unworkable but also positively harmful. This morning the Leader of the Opposition, perhaps recognising the mistake he made, had begun to shift his ground. He was no longer talking about bodgie patent applications; he was talking about court proceedings. - The Leader of the Opposition interjects. The Leader of the Opposition ought to be reminded of what he said. He said:Protect the PBS by preventing and penalising drug companies that try to stop cheaper generic drugs coming onto the market by lodging dodgy patent claims. - I will read the next sentence:The validity of patent claims would be determined by a court ...What? You are going to have 24,000 claims a year determined by a court! The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition knew absolutely nothing about the operations of the patent law of this country, and that is why five departments of state - that is, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet; the Attorney-General's Department; the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources; the Department of Health and Ageing; and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade - have jointly said to the government: `We do not believe a legislative amendment to deliver on the opposition's stated policy can be drafted.' That was the advice of five departments.What the Leader of the Opposition has to do, when he gets up on his feet in this House and talks about amendments, is that he has to tell the Australian people what amendment he has in mind. Does he have in mind Tuesday's amendment or does he have in mind some other kind of amendment? Tuesday's amendment, according to five departments of state, cannot be drafted on the basis of the opposition's stated policy. They are not my words; they are the words of five departments of state. Perhaps that is why the Leader of the Opposition has so dramatically shifted his ground to today's position, because what he was saying on Tuesday is quite different to what he is saying today. I simply say to Leader of the Opposition: what amendment is he talking about? Is he talking about an amendment that is going to clobber the working of the intellectual property system or is he talking about some other amendment? If he is, could he please give us the amendment?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question. Of course, it is a very important question, and it has been a very important case that the government has been running on behalf of Australia's sugar producers in the WTO. Yes, I am aware of media reports overnight that an interim report has been released by the panel with regard to Australia's challenge, along with a number of other countries, to the European Union's export subsidies that are applied to their exports of sugar. I can confirm that we have received information in terms of the interim report that has come out overnight. We should acknowledge that that is a draft report. The final report will be due out in September. In answer to the member's question, it would be a significant and very important win for our sugar producers. A win would require the European Union to remove four million tonnes of its current sugar exports from the world market - that is, four million tonnes of heavily subsidised sugar from the world market. That would result in increasing the world price for sugar in the longer term and raising the income of Australia's hard-working sugar farmers, who rely very heavily on exports for their income. In fact, about 80 per cent of their returns come from exports.This is going to be a very important case coming at a crucial time in the history of the multilateral process. Only last week, we resolved in the WTO an agreement on a framework to go ahead in the Doha Round which included a negotiation to eliminate export subsidies - the ultimate elimination of the most distorting mechanism that is used by exporting countries. We achieved three key areas of further negotiation as a result of the efforts over the last couple of years, particularly last week in Geneva. Firstly, there was a historic commitment to eliminate agricultural export subsidies. These are the export subsidies that we have just challenged in the WTO, and the interim report indicates we may very well be successful in that challenge which will deliver significant benefits to Australia's sugarcane farmers. The second area of success is that we have achieved agreement to go ahead and negotiate significant cuts by rich developed countries in domestic support provided to farmers in those wealthy countries. Thirdly, we have agreed to go ahead and negotiate substantial improvements in market access for all agricultural products.In answer to the member's question, in terms of the government prosecuting the case in the international forums on behalf of Australian sugar producers, it seems that there may be an imminent and very positive outcome in this case for Australia's sugar producers by removing some of the inequities from the global marketplace. In the longer term, we have established a framework to go ahead and negotiate, once and for all, the elimination of these iniquitous export subsidies from the global trading regime, which will, over the longer term, deliver significant benefits to Australia's sugar producers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and I appreciate his interest as well. Obviously, being a representative for Townsville, he has a particular focus on security given the presence of the Australia Defence Force there. I will be visiting North Korea on 17-18 August and will meet with senior North Korean leaders to obviously talk about our bilateral relationship, but in particular to discuss concerns about North Korea's nuclear activities. I think the visit is particularly timely because it reinforces proposals that were made in June to the North Koreans during the six-party talks. Given that these proposals were only finalised in June, I think Australia can play a particular role in assisting the process of eventually dismantling North Korea's nuclear programs but also potentially providing other assistance as well.I will take the opportunity while in North Korea to urge its leaders to take the opportunity they now have to re-engage with the international community and to give the North Korean people the opportunity to see their own living standards - and hopefully, too, their human rights - improve. This visit comes on the back of discussions that we have had at the officials' level with the Chinese, the South Koreans, the Japanese and also, importantly, the Americans. During the last month I was over in Washington with Senator Hill for AUSMIN. During the course of AUSMIN there was, needless to say, quite substantial discussion about the issue of North Korea. I think it is probably worth making this point: countries around the region know that we are close to the United States, and we make no secret of that. And the Labor Party makes no secret of the fact that they think we are close to the United States - though they think it is a mistake. But within the region they do not think it is a mistake. Within the region there is a view that Australia's close relationship with the United States is advantageous to the region. We can bring perspectives to bear that others cannot. We can handle diplomacy in ways others are not able to do.I notice that in a doorstop this morning the sometimes loquacious member for Griffith was asked by a journalist about this visit to North Korea:Doesn't this show that Labor's position that Australian ties with Asia have been jeopardised due to our closer ties with Washington - doesn't that reject, repudiate your position?The member for Griffith said:When have I ever said that?The journalist went on to ask the next question, and the member for Griffiths said:No. I think you're verballing me enormously on that question. I never said that.The member for Griffith is one of those who always call people liars. Do you know what they say about people who do that? They say with those sorts of people you always need to look very carefully at what they themselves say. Laurie Oakes asked him on Anzac Day this year:Where does the fact that we have been invited - this was, to an Australia-ASEAN summit - leave Labor's claim that Australia is being shunned in Asia because we are too close to the Americans?The member for Griffith - a different day, a different month, a different thought and a different doorstop - said:It leaves our claims in fundamentally good shape, Laurie.So it was in good shape back then in April and now he says, `When did I ever say that? I never said that.' It is all part of the Leader of the Opposition's team and style, carried on by his lieutenants, that you just make stuff up as you go along. You do not think anything through. You do not try to work through an argument. You do not try to think out a serious policy. You just play politics and play politics endlessly. Needless to say, those sorts of cheapskate remarks do not get any run in the media because they do not deserve any run.</DOC>

 - The answer to the bulk of the question - in fact, to all of the question - is no. But I might take the opportunity while I am on my feet to point out that, in the rare morsels that we have received in relation to the Labor Party's economic and tax policy, there is no guarantee that you will not cancel the $600 in the second year of the forward estimates period. You have only guaranteed them for this coming year; you have not guaranteed them thereafter. The man with the largest claw in this House is the member for Lilley. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question and his ongoing support for business, particularly in his electorate and generally throughout Australia. There has been some interesting analysis of workplace relations policy recently - on some occasions in the media and on some occasions by other organisations. In the media a couple of weeks ago on radio in Sydney, the Leader of the Opposition was asked by Alan Jones:So would you keep the award though to the current 20 allowable matters?The response from the Leader of the Opposition was:Well, we've got no policy to expand those matters ... - The Leader of the Opposition quite clearly does not understand his own policy. - The Leader of the Opposition is, once again, not across the detail of matters before him - and, in this case, it is his own policy, which calls for the re-introduction of `a system of comprehensive, contemporary and relevant awards'. In fact, the member for Rankin went on the radio in Newcastle on the same day and - contrary to what the Leader of the Opposition told Alan Jones that morning - he said:There's no numerical limits on the matters that can be included in awards.So we have a situation here, a bit like we have today, where the Leader of the Opposition does not have a grasp of the detail of policy. In relation to his own industrial relations policy, the Leader of the Opposition does not understand it; in fact, he was corrected on the same day by the member for Rankin - on the same day.But that is not the worst of it, because this shows that, so far as awards are concerned, if the Labor Party is elected to government the sky is the limit - the sky is the limit for the number of awards and the matters in them. We would have a return to this: hundreds of pages of awards that seek to regulate every minute of workers' lives in Australia. We know for sure that this will be sought by the unions because we have already been told so. The CFMEU mining secretary, Tony Meagher, left us in absolutely no doubt about this when he promised that his union - and you can bet the others will do this as well - will pursue everything that was taken out and then some more. So what we would have is not 20 allowable matters but `the sky's the limit' under the Labor Party's industrial relations system.Why would the CFMEU be pursuing it? For four million good reasons - the $4 million that the CFMEU has donated to the Labor Party since 1996. We are not the only ones saying this. I read with interest an article in the Australian Financial Review on Tuesday under the heading `Labor heads back to the bad old days'. This was not written by me or by someone from business; this was written by John Edwards. Who is John Edwards? John Edwards was the former senior economic adviser to Paul Keating when the Labor Party was in government. What does John Edwards say in his article in the Australian Financial Review? Amongst other things, he says: ... the Australian industrial relations system could thus leap back to the 1960s and 1970s - a backward leap to the 1960s and 1970s under the proposals of the Latham Labor Party. Professor Edwards continues:... it reinvokes the very worst element of the old system.So here you see someone who was one of the architects of Labor's industrial relations policy under Prime Minister Keating canning it and saying that Labor is heading back to the bad old days. When asked about this, we had the member for Rankin come in here a day or so ago and say, `This won't lead to paid rates awards.' That is like saying, `We're going to put a huge hole in the dam wall and we are not going to expect the flood to come through.' You bet it is. That is what the CFMEU is saying and that is what other leaders of unions around Australia are saying. I heard the Leader of the Opposition quoting the Business Council earlier. I bet we do not hear him quoting their recent report on the Labor Party's industrial relations policy, which was commissioned from Access Economics, which I note in passing was, at one stage at least, the economist of choice of the Labor Party. In their analysis of the ALP's industrial relations policy, the Business Council and Access Economics say this in part of their conclusion:The overall direction of the ALP platform appears to be towards more regulation, a broadening of the factors and parties involved in the determination of wages and conditions and that workplace relations system and structures will increasingly be used to deliver non-market outcomes and objectives.They go on and say:Such policies are unlikely to deliver on the four goals espoused by the ALP, high growth, low incomes, low unemployment and a fairer Australia. For the reasons outlined above and earlier, the ALP workplace relations policy platform runs the risk of moving Australia further from these goals.In other words, that means fewer jobs, higher unemployment, lower productivity and lower growth in Australia. That would be a disaster for the Australian economy and a disaster for Australian workers. A vote for Labor is a vote for fewer jobs. A vote for Latham is a vote for lower living standards.</DOC>

 - The best proof of the bona fides of the government on this issue is that the benefits announced in the budget are flowing. They are flowing to the great satisfaction of Australian families. - I had the opportunity over the five weeks of the winter recess to travel extensively around the Australian nation and I can assure the member for Lilley that families of Australia like the family benefits contained in the last budget. What is more, they would like them to stay. Most of them are quite insulted by this line being run by the Labor Party that average Australian parents are not capable of knowing how to spend $600.  - This idea that they are all too uneducated and too foolish, that you cannot really trust them, is good old Labor Party paternalism: do not trust the parents of Australia. For heaven's sake, do not give them $600; that is too much to manage. I think the best people in Australia to know how to spend money for their children are the parents of those children. I think they are better than any social security minister. I think they are better than any politically correct adviser. I simply say to the member for Lilley and to all those sitting opposite: the Australian people know where they stand with their family benefits under this government. They have actually gone up by more than 100 per cent in real terms in the 8½ years that this government has been in power. - As a result of the changes that were made in the budget, there is a $600 lump sum supplement. The value of that supplement will be maintained in real terms and legislation has been passed making that perfectly plain. There will be no clawing back. The only claws are the claws of the person who asked me the question, because his party has failed to guarantee that they are going to keep the family tax benefit supplement increase. All they have said is that they are going to guarantee it for a year or two. That is an added reason why I think the families of Australia should see the taxation policies of the alternative government. They could see whether their $600 is safe or whether, under a Labor government, not only they would receive less but be given less discretion as to how to spend it. I will always put my faith in the parents of Australia ahead of the governments of Australia. They know what is best for their children and it is an insult to say that they do not know how to spend $600 for the benefit of their children. On that note, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - The short answer to the question is no. The slightly longer answer to the question is as follows. On behalf of the government, I reject the claims that have been made by the 43 people. I completely reject the claims that have been made. Could I just take the House back to the basis of the claim. The basis of the claim of dishonesty and deception is that the government deliberately misled the Australian people regarding the existence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction when the decision was taken to involve this country in the military conflict.Let me point out to the House that it been found by not only the Flood inquiry but also the Jull committee inquiry - which included in its membership the current shadow minister for defence; a former defence minister in the Keating government, Senator Robert Ray; as well as government members - that there was absolutely no evidence that the government had put any pressure on the intelligence agencies. The debate in March last year was not about whether Iraq had weapons of mass destruction but, indeed, about how we should deal as a nation and as a world with the possession of those weapons of mass destruction.It is interesting, in the light of the comments that have been made by General Gration, that General Gration himself, in November 2002, in an article published by the Australian National University, had this to say:I think we can accept that Iraq has numbers of weapons of mass destruction and has programs to develop them further.They were, in fact, the words. I do not criticise General Gration for those remarks. I merely point out -  - that, in November 2002, General Gration himself said that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. I think it is instructive that a few months earlier the shadow minister for foreign affairs had said that it was an empirical fact - and you do not get any tougher than that - that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. May I say to the 43 people who penned that letter that in order to establish a charge of deception you have to prove that the government deliberately set out to mislead the Australian people, and they have not done that. In fact, their principal spokesman has acknowledged that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. But if you do not want to rely on General Gration's remarks and you do not want to rely on the shadow minister for foreign affairs, may I draw your attention to an interview on Lateline between Tony Jones and Robert Ray on 1 March this year on the Jull committee report. This is what Tony Jones asked:Robert Ray, what do you think about that? Were the Australian people effectively misled by the Government's reliance on flawed intelligence to justify the war?Robert Ray replied:Well, the key question is were they deliberately misled. And his answer was:I believe not.That is what Robert Ray said. So you have General Gration, you have the shadow minister for foreign affairs and you have a former Labor Party defence minister all saying that, of course, there was no deception. In fact, both General Gration and the shadow minister for foreign affairs argued that Iraq did possess weapons of mass destruction. I repeat: the debate last year was not about whether Iraq had weapons of mass destruction; the debate was about how you dealt with it. It remains the case that if the coalition of the willing had not acted Saddam Hussein would still be in power in Iraq, with all the horrific human rights consequences that that would have entailed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flinders for his question. The reason we have had a strong economy over the last 8½ years is that we have had a good government that has managed the economy well, we have had a Treasurer who knows how to keep a budget in surplus and we have had a succession of industrial relations ministers who have been prepared to carry the fight with the trade union movement of Australia and to make sure that productivity, and not the power of union officials, is the dominant consideration in industrial relations.That is why I greet - and I know that those who believe in economic progress will greet - with total disdain the industrial relations policies released over the past few days by the Australian Labor Party. They do not take us back 8½ years; they in fact take us back about 25 years. At a time when the percentage of the private sector work force in this country who belong to trade unions has fallen to 17½ per cent - that is, 17½ per cent of people employed in the private sector now choose to belong to a trade union - the opposition want to hand over 100 per cent of the industrial relations laws of this country to the trade union movement.We have seen over the last 8½ years the growth of the Australian economy. We have seen it put in a stellar performance in relation to employment growth, low inflation and productivity improvement. The productivity of the average worker in the market sector has increased by 23 per cent since 1996. Reforms to the waterfront have resulted in a 75 per cent improvement in the crane rates at our major ports. Industrial disputes have fallen from an average of 198 days lost per 1,000 employees under Labor to an average of 71 days lost under the coalition. This productivity performance has flowed through to real wages in the form of a 14 per cent increase in real wages since 1996, compared with a miserable 2.9 per cent in 13 years under the former government.What is the response of the Labor Party to all of this? The response of the Labor Party to all of this is to say, `We may only represent 17½ per cent of the private sector work force who are trade unionists, but we're going to hand over 100 per cent of the industrial relations system to the trade union movement.' Under Labor's policy, they are going to abolish AWAs, give unions greater powers of entry, allow unlimited strike action without secret ballots, restrict the use of casual employment by attacking holiday and sick pay, remove the secondary boycott provisions from the Trade Practices Act, abolish junior rates of pay leading to the potential loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs for young Australians, expand the content and the role of awards, re-regulate the bargaining process and return to a system of industry wide pattern bargaining, introduce a federal payroll tax, drag independent contractors back into the industrial relations system, and give preference in awarding government contracts to firms that are union friendly. It was best summarised by Access Economics, which has sometimes given economic advice to the Australian Labor Party. This is what Access Economics had to say:At best, these changes could slow the pace of progress observed over the past decade. At worst, the policy changes proposed could undermine Australia's ability to sustain strong productivity, jobs and economic growth.Let me finish by reminding the House that one of the highlights of Australia's international economic performance over the last two or three years was the signing of the giant 25-year $25 billion LNG contract with the Guangdong Province in China. This is an example of what we can do for the future and in the future. If there is one sector of the Australian economy that will be threatened perhaps more than any other by the return of an outdated industrial relations system, it is the resource sector. The growth of the resource sector has been underpinned by the expansion of individual contracts. The abolition of AWAs and a return to a union dominated industrial relations system at a federal level will do enormous damage to the international competitiveness of the Australian resource sector. I cannot understand the mentality of a political party that says it is interested in the future yet it wants to take us back 25 years when it comes to industrial relations.</DOC>

 - In reply to the Leader of the Opposition, it is not unprecedented. I thought it happened in both Britain and America in the past 18 months. I would have thought the inspiration for this was as much what occurred in those two countries as elsewhere. Can I say on this issue generally that I respect fully the right of any Australian to disagree with the government, to attack the government, to attack the opposition. - All of these people are now retired from service, as I understand it, and they have a perfect right to make this statement. I am happy to engage the statement on the merits. I dealt previously with the issue of deception. I pointed out that somebody as authoritative as a former Labor defence minister - who I think, with respect, knows more about security matters than the Leader of the Opposition does - had pointed out that there had been no deception by the government. I reminded the House, and I remind the Leader of the Opposition, that 18 months ago the debate was not about whether Iraq had WMD; it was about what we were going to do about Iraq's possession of the WMD. That was the debate 18 months ago. The Leader of the Opposition has asked me about the question of accepting responsibility. I accept responsibility for all of the decisions taken by the government I lead - of course I do. I am ultimately accountable, as the Leader of the Opposition well knows, to the Australian people. And the Australian people, at some time in the not too distant future, will have an opportunity to decide who is better to be placed in charge of the nation's affairs, be they economic or matters relating to national security. I will be very happy to answer before the bar of public opinion for what I have done in the position I have occupied over the last 8½ years.I will take the opportunity of reminding the Leader of the Opposition that we will never allow the foreign policy of this country to be determined by terrorists. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that the world has changed a great deal since 11 September 2001. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that the first criticism specifically made of Australia by the al-Qaeda movement was in relation to Australia's action to liberate the people of East Timor. That was the first criticism that was made. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that ASIO provided information to the government, which I have disclosed to the House before, that Australia was looked upon as a potential terrorist target long before the attack that took place in New York and Washington on 11 September 2001. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that the terrible attack that claimed 88 lives in Bali took place before Australia's involvement in the military action against Iraq. Not only would I remind him of that but I would also remind those who penned that letter of those realities. With great respect to them, I would point out that 42 out of the 43 people who penned that letter had in fact retired from service long before 11 September 2001, and many of them had retired from service years before that particular event took place. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell, and I acknowledge all of the wonderful work that he does for his constituents in that electorate. Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the housing finance commitments data for the month of June, which showed that the total value of housing finance fell 4.7 per cent and is 9.5 per cent lower over the course of the year. This is the fifth decline in the last eight months, and total housing finance is now 20 per cent lower than the peak in October 2003. In particular, the figures were led by a fall in housing finance for investor financing, which was down 8.8 per cent in June and is now 30.4 per cent lower than its peak in October last year. As a consequence, we are beginning to see something show up in those figures that I have been warning of for some time - that unsustainable rises, particularly in investor financing, could not be continued. For the last 12 to 18 months the government has been warning that, as supply exceeds demand, you would see a correction in relation to that market. Indeed, as I have also said in the House, the government welcomes the fact that finance appears to be stabilising on a more sustainable base. The government has also indicated that it welcomes the fact that prices may well be plateauing. All of the available indicators show that house price growth in the first half of 2004 either moderated or declined slightly. Auction clearance rates have fallen sharply, and building approvals have fallen by around 13 per cent.A consequence of all of this is that the proportion of first home buyers is rising. The number of loans to first home buyers has increased around 30 per cent since the trough of January 2004. From a low of 12.8 per cent, the finance data shows that first home buyers accounted for 14.4 per cent in June. So we are seeing first home buyers come back into the market and that proportion rising again. It still has quite a way to go to get back to historical levels, but it is rising from the trough.In a situation where finance is turning down - particularly turning down in the investor area - one of the worst economic responses that you could possibly introduce would be a new tax on investor financing. Who would introduce a new tax on investor financing right at the time when investor financing has declined by 30.4 per cent from its peak in October? Who would introduce it? None other than the state Labor government of New South Wales under Premier Carr and Treasurer Egan, who blundered into this market precisely at the wrong time with a new exit tax on investors who are in the housing market in New South Wales. It illustrates the damage you can do if you are an incompetent government that does not understand an economic cycle.Why do I raise that? I raise it for another reason. To my knowledge, the only person in this House who has previously advocated a capital gains tax on the family home is the member for Werriwa. I regret to inform the House that the member for Werriwa was, to my knowledge, the only person who has ever advocated the introduction of a capital gains tax on the family home. It was also the member for Werriwa in his celebrated first interview on the Lateline program who advocated revisiting negative gearing in the property market. It is true that it was the policy that lasted from Lateline to lunchtime, but it did actually take its place on that Lateline program.The government has been saying for quite some time that it is important to bear in mind that a market that is growing at 20 or 30 per cent is unsustainable and that what we needed was some sustainable plateauing of prices and development in relation to the housing cycle. We are now seeing the evidence of that come through. We are seeing it in market clearance, we are seeing it in loan approvals, we are seeing it in credit and we are seeing it in relation to construction. But this will take very careful management, and certainly not the kind of incompetent management we have seen practised by the New South Wales Labor government and advocated by the member for Werriwa. The economy is poised at a very delicate position. The Australia economy cannot afford mismanagement as it goes forward into these challenges. </DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, can I just repeat -  -  - I have already indicated the reasons why I regard the proposition put by the Leader of the Opposition and, indeed, the proposition put by the 43 signatories in relation to the terrorist threat as one that I do not support and I reject. In further support of that, let me quote a source that I do not always quote, but nonetheless he has had direct experience in relation to these matters. I refer in particular to a former head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and former chief of staff of the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Michael Costello. Writing in the Australian in March of this year, Mr Costello called the debate suggesting that Iraq had made us a greater terrorist target absurd. He went on to say:Our alliance with the US, indeed the very fact we are a western nation, made us one....	...	...War has been declared on us by religious fanatics who are prepared to wage that war without limit.The reality is that we are a target because of who we are and what we believe in, not for what we have done. That is the weakness in the reasoning of the Leader of the Opposition. It is the weakness in the reasoning, with great respect, of the 43 people whose signatures appended the declaration. By all means there will continue to be a debate in this country about the impact of our involvement in Iraq and the reasons for and against it. That is a proper part of the democratic process, but anybody who imagines that by some kind of weakness or nuancing of our foreign policy we can buy immunity from the wrath of terrorists in the future is completing deluding themselves. That seems to be the mentality that is advanced by the Leader of the Opposition. Many decades of history over the last 100 years have taught the world that if you seek some kind of immunity and some kind of solace in weakness and appeasement you end up paying an infinitely greater price for your weakness.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I can inform the House that today the Reserve Bank released its quarterly statement on monetary policy, setting out its view of Australia's economic outlook and providing insight into monetary policy deliberations. Members of the House will know that, for eight consecutive months, monetary policy has been unchanged in Australia and the official cash rate is at 5 per cent. Today in its statement on monetary policy the Reserve Bank says: Economic developments over recent months point to continued good growth of the Australian economy. The global upswing has maintained its momentum since the early part of the year and should provide an improving environment for Australian exporters. Business and consumer confidence are at high levels. At the same time, adjustment is occurring in the Australian housing market, which is no longer in the overheated condition seen at the end of last year.As I indicated in response to the member for Dobell, we are now seeing the heat come out of the housing market - we are seeing it in clearance rates, in approvals, in construction and in credit. The Reserve Bank agrees with the government's assessment that, as the global economy picks up, Australia's exports should strengthen and that Australian consumer and business confidence remains strong in a growing economy based on low inflation. In fact, the Reserve Bank assesses the underlying inflation rate at around two per cent and actually forecasts that remaining at around 2½ per cent - the middle of the target band - until the end of 2005.Over the last eight years, considerable progress has been made in relation to the Australian economy. Let me inform the House as to what some of that progress has been. Over the last eight years, inflation has averaged 2.4 per cent. That compares with inflation under 13 years of Labor government averaging 5.2 per cent - more than double. - Over the last eight years, the home mortgage interest rate has been around seven per cent, compared with Labor's average of 12 per cent, peaking at 17 per cent. If the home mortgage interest rate were to return to the Labor average, then people who are on the average new interest loan in Australia would be paying $960 per month extra. The risk of a return to Labor government would be another $960 a month. Let me make this point: that is post tax income, so that if you are on the top marginal rate you would have to be earning another $2,000 a month to be able to pay that in after-tax terms.People often say to me: `Why was it that the Australian Labor Party averaged home mortgage interest rates at 12 per cent? Were they trying to have high mortgage interest rates? Was it some kind of policy?' It was not that they deliberately targeted high interest rates; it was that Labor could not manage the Australian economy so as to keep interest rates low, and that was when they were led by people who had a modicum of economic responsibility - much more than the current member for Werriwa, if I may say so.The risks to Australia's economic management lie squarely in the election of a Labor government, and every Australian ought to know this. Labor stands for higher interest rates. Labor stood for 12 per cent average interest rates in the 13 years to 1996. Labor has $9.5 billion of spending promises on the table as we speak, and Labor has still not released its tax policy. Labor promised its tax policy in the week of the budget - now three months ago. Every week that goes by is just another week where Labor attempts to con the Australian public without releasing the policy it has promised of tax cuts for all, more spending, an intergenerational fund and more left over at the end of it. That is not even a trifecta; it is a quaddie. They now have a quaddie of commitments going out there: less tax, take in more; more spending, pay out more; intergenerational fund, invest more; and larger surplus, have more left over at the end of it. It is not even a trifecta: a quaddie of unbelievable promises, now coming in 13 weeks late. The reason, of course, that the quaddie has not come in yet is that this quaddie is unbelievable. It is an unbelievable series of promises which the Leader of the Opposition hides from the Australian public because he cannot take the scrutiny of the government and the press in relation to this matter. It is about time that he came clean.</DOC>

 - The flaw, if I may say so with the greatest of respect to those who penned the statement, in their reasoning, and therefore the flaw in the reasoning put forward by the Leader of the Opposition in his question, is that in relation to Iraq they have not established their case, because, to quote the words of Robert Ray - hardly a Liberal - the key question in relation to Iraq is whether the government deliberately set out to mislead the Australian people. I know the Labor Party may find this a bit awkward, but he in fact said in that interview that I quoted:Well, the key question is were they deliberately misled. I believe not.You may go on to say that the intelligence was flawed, with the benefit of hindsight. You may go on to say that some of the intelligence was limited and ambiguous, but on the key question of deceit, of dishonesty, you have Senator Ray saying the Australian public were not misled.I accept fully the right of these 43 people to express their views. They represent a range of people of different experiences. A number of them are habitual critics of the government, but I would not say that in relation to numbers of the others. I do not seek in any way to attack them personally. I am dealing with the merits, and on the merits they are wrong. I am not going to cop a charge of dishonesty against me or against my government and I am not going to cop lectures from the Leader of the Opposition about ethics and truth in government unless the Leader of the Opposition establishes a case. He is basing his question on the claim made by these 43 people. I say to them, through you, Mr Speaker: where is the evidence of the government having deliberately misled the Australian people? There is none. To quote the words of the British Prime Minister, who faced a similar charge in the House of Commons after he had his inquiry: there were no lies and there was no deceit. The argument that I took this country to war based on a lie is itself a lie. There has been no evidence produced. The Leader of the Opposition, quite frankly, today has not been able to produce any evidence to support the claim. The Flood inquiry exonerated the government of heavying the intelligence agency, and the Jull inquiry exonerated the government. The shadow foreign minister - the bloke sitting next to the member for Lilley at the present time - was the very person who put it on the line before the Iraq invasion began when he declared, addressing the State Zionist Council of Victoria, that it was an empirical fact that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. That was Rudd's view. Indeed, Flood pointed out that there was only one government in the world that believed at the time that Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction, and that was the government of Saddam Hussein. The argument 18 months ago was not whether Iraq had WMD; the argument 18 months ago was what you were going to do about it. There were those in the Labor Party who wanted to do something and there were those in the Labor Party who wanted to sit on their hands and do nothing. If action had not been taken by the coalition of the willing, then Saddam Hussein would still be running Iraq. Let me return the fire to the Leader of the Opposition and say to him -  - is he prepared to accept responsibility for the fact that, if his party's policy had been followed, Saddam Hussein would still be the dictator of Iraq? That is the burden of the responsibility that he carries. I will answer questions about independent Speakers if the Leader of the Opposition can establish a case that we misled the Australian people in relation to Iraq. The 43 have not done so, nor has the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. I respond by asking a rhetorical question: what was the penultimate example of Australia's industrial relations weaknesses when we came to government in the mid-1990s? It was the waterfront. It was held up here and internationally as a laughing stock, something that held Australia back and was symptomatic of a deep industrial relations malaise. Between the end of the war and 1995 or so, there were an astonishing 39 inquiries into waterfront productivity in Australia and no-one had succeeded in fixing it.Of course, the greatest failure to fix it was in fact WIRA, the Labor government's attempt to fix it cooperatively. It resulted in nothing but the lining of the pockets of some well-known Labor mates who got some expensive consultancies out of it. We as a government have delivered in this area where the Labor Party not only said we could not deliver but also failed so abysmally themselves. They said that it was un-Australian to expect us to be able to move 25 containers an hour across our major ports on average when we were stuck, under their regime, at something around 15. We have exceeded our own target for 13 quarters in a row. We now know beyond all doubt, thanks to the member for Rankin, that the claim that I have often made about the member for Batman - that he wants to give control of the waterfront back to the MUA - is undoubtedly the case. How do we know that it is the case? It is because of the sleight of hand that the Labor Party uses. On the one hand they profess to oppose secondary boycott activity but then, on the other hand, they say that they are going to pull it out of the Trade Practices Act and put it back into the industrial relations legislation. That is a sleight of hand. It hides their real objective, which, amongst other things, is to give the Australian waterfront - which has been so improved, has so helped our exports and has so undergirded more and better paid jobs, not just on the waterfront but also in the export sector - back to the MUA. Employers, the Labor Party, the Leader of the Opposition and the unions all know that the major deterrent preventing secondary boycotts in this country is the power that the ACCC has both to discover boycott activity and to impose hefty fines on it. The Industrial Relations Commission has no such powers - and the member for Rankin knows that - nor does it have the capacity to impose the sorts of fines that the ACCC can impose.It ought to be remembered by industry and exporters that, without those powers being exercised by the ACCC, we would not have got waterfront reform in this country to the great benefit of the nation. It ought to be remembered that it was not the national interest that stopped the MUA imposing secondary boycotts during that difficult reform process. The member for Rankin naively would have us believe that somehow the unions are only interested in cooperation and mediation. That is not what they are paid for. They are paid to be advocates. The fact is that it was not the national interest that stopped the MUA imposing secondary boycotts when we were going through that reform process, and it will not be in the future either; it was then the threat of being slapped with $750,000 fines by the ACCC, just as it needs to be in the future.The Labor Party says that it opposes secondary boycotts and that it will retain protection for businesses from boycott action, but it is going to remove the regulator and the deterrent. The outcome is quite obvious. What the Labor Party is really doing, of course, is the bidding of its union masters. The question has to be asked: why does the Labor Party want to give the waterfront back to the MUA? The answer is: because the union movement wants it. The only assertion that can be drawn out of this is that the Labor Party wants fewer Australian jobs and lower paid Australian jobs so that it can restore the power of the unions. That is not only naive; it is a disgrace.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question, and indicate to him and to the House that last Friday the member for Rankin released the Australian Labor Party's industrial relations policy. One person was missing from the release of that important policy. The person who was nowhere to be seen when this important economic policy for Australia was released was, of course, the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition misleads the Australian public when he says that this policy will not affect flexibility and productivity in Australia, as he claimed yesterday. As business and many Australians know, this policy would be a disaster for job creation and productivity. What we have in this policy is a plan to do a number of things, including the reintroduction of comprehensive and prescriptive awards in Australia, returning us to 500-page awards and awards that seek to regulate every minute of every day of workers in Australia.Let me take an example, because the member for Rankin says, `This policy would be based on what we have in New South Wales and Queensland.' I was looking through some awards in New South Wales and Queensland and I came across the New South Wales pastoral employees state award. This award contains, in part of its minutiae, such detail for the menu for pastoral workers as items including peas - split and blue - tapioca or sago, suet, cream of tartar and dripping. This is the menu for pastoral workers in New South Wales. It has the sort of detail - the mind-numbing, productivity sapping detail - that the member for Rankin and the Leader of the Opposition want to return to all awards in Australia. Then there is the provision about smoko lunches. It says that where the shearing shed is within 229 metres walking distance from the kitchen, smoko lunches are to be held in the shed. What we are going to have right around Australia is managers of farms measuring out whether the shearing shed is 229 metres or 230 metres from the kitchen. - This is the sort of mind-numbing, productivity sapping detail which the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party want returned to awards throughout Australia. There is a deception at the heart of the Labor Party's policy, because the member for Rankin says, `Oh, but the Labor Party in government would not introduce these provisions into awards.' - No, it does not have to, as the Deputy Prime Minister says. It just puts the provisions in place so that trade unions around Australia can do what we have see in the pastoral award - that is, introduce all this sort of minute detail into awards. - On top of that, we know the member for Rankin and the Labor Party say that the sky is the limit as far as allowable matters in awards in Australia are concerned. No wonder there has been commentary in the newspapers in the last couple of days about these policies. The editorial in the Weekend Australian on Saturday stated:... the overall impact of Dr Emerson's plan would be alarming. His idea is to re-regulate the workforce by creating a system where the industrial courts can decide on all sorts of issues beyond the basics of wages and conditions and to give unions the chance to represent workers, regardless of whether their help is wanted or not. Dr Emerson says industrial courts would only get involved in intractable disputes, but - as the editorial writer points out - these are easily manufactured.In today's Financial Review, amongst other things, the editorial says:Jobless people are virtually airbrushed from Labor's policy, which pretends that labour market regulation exists in isolation from other policies.The editorial goes on to say:And Labor hasn't explained why we should put any of our gains in workplace flexibility at risk at a time when competitiveness is only going to intensify ... unless it's to keep faith with the unions, which pay most of Labor's bills.Why do we have this job-destroying, regressive, centralised policy from the Australian Labor Party? There are 40 million reasons why - that is, this is a policy written by the union bosses for the union bosses in repayment of the $40 million which they have donated to the Australian Labor Party over the last eight years. This is a job-destroying policy which adds up to the same economic credentials of the Leader of the Opposition, who will not release his economic policy but who, as far as workplace relations is concerned, is not interested in the jobs of ordinary Australians.</DOC>

 - I do not have the advantage -  - I do not have the advantage of having the Hansard with me, but, as always when I am asked a question of this kind, I will check the recollection of the interrogator before I commit myself finally. But my recollection was that that was in the context of HECS funded places and that nobody was going to be forced to pay. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is running around this country deliberately spreading the proposition that a normal university degree is going to cost $100,000. She wants everybody to believe that. She is dishonestly representing to the Australian public that an ordinary degree will cost $100,000. Is there any person on this side of the House who doubts that that is the purpose of what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is doing? Yet she knows that, hand in glove with the changes that we have made to allow people to pay full fees, we are going to increase the number of HECS places. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and indeed the Leader of the Opposition, know full well that the charge that normal degrees are going to become $100,000 is itself a misrepresentation of the position. So, far from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition bringing me to account for misleading the Australian people, I bring the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to account for misleading the Australian people.The changes that we have introduced are sensible reforms to the university system in this country. There will be more HECS funded places. There will be the same opportunities given to Australians to have fully funded degrees. There will be loans available. If the policies announced so far by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition are introduced, they will impose very severe financial constraints on quite a number of Australia's universities, a fact already attested to by the vice-chancellors of the universities. I reject the false, dishonest claim contained in the question of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It is she who is being dishonest with the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question, noting that she ran a very successful small business before coming into this place, employing many young Australians in particular. The member for Gilmore has real experience and understands how important it is to have a flexible workplace relations system. The initiatives of the Liberal-National government in initiating simplified awards, introducing Australian workplace agreements, putting in place secondary boycott protection in the Trade Practices Act and introducing freedom of association have all contributed to a stronger economy, better profits and, significantly, greater flexibility in the workplace, particularly for small business.I am asked about concerns. I did become a little concerned when the member for Rankin released a policy on Friday. It was good enough for the Leader of the Opposition to turn up to a book launch last week, but he did not turn up to the launch of his own industrial relations policy. I asked myself: why would he do that? Why would he go to a book launch but not go to the launch of one of his key policies? When we started to peel away the Labor Party's industrial relations policy, we got a better feel for what it means for small business. For example, casual employees will have the right to demand a permanent position. It is still unclear in the Labor Party's policy after how many weeks a casual employee will be able to demand a permanent position. The ACTU says two weeks. The Labor Party had no detail in their policy, surprisingly enough.The Labor Party say small businesses will have to keep a position for parents returning to the workplace on a part-time basis for up to five years. They are taking out the secondary boycott protection in the Trade Practices Act. The Labor Party's policy says that union officials will have a right to enter all businesses. Of course, overarching all this, the Labor Party's policy is bringing to the table the trade union movement in any negotiation between an employer and an employee. The member for Hotham - the very well tanned member for Hotham, who has perhaps been on holidays, maybe to St Helena -   - The member for Hotham says it is sensible policy to send any dispute between an employer and an employee off to the Industrial Relations Commission. Let us look at what it is going to cost every small business to resolve a dispute with an employee if they go to the Industrial Relations Commission. Step 1: lodging paperwork seeking an exemption will cost at least $500 to $1,000. If they are going to seek further advice in relation to any initial conference it could cost up to a further $2,000. If they have full arbitration it could cost up to between $3,000 and $5,000 per day at the IRC. So, any small business that wants to resolve a dispute in relation to casual employment versus permanent part-time or in relation to the role of a union entering the workplace, goes off to the IRC and it costs $2,000.The catch in all of this is that the Labor Party knows that whenever there is an unfair dismissal dispute many small businesses are paying `go away' money to the employee rather than having to carry the enormous cost of legal representation and taking the matter to the IRC or even beyond that. So in a very sneaky way the Labor Party is hoping that this will go under the radar of 1.1 million small businesses. Between now and polling day, we are going to do everything we can to bring to the attention of Australia's small businesses the Labor Party's industrial relations policy. That policy takes away flexibility; it reduces the real wages of employees. Significantly, the Labor Party's industrial relations policy is bad for employees and it is bad for business.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for raising this issue. I have three comments to make. The first is that I have not seen the amendments yet. I do not think anybody has. Let me say that I will be very happy, when I do see the amendments, to have a look at them and to communicate to the parliament what the government's attitude might be. - Hello! He's getting a bit interjectory. - Yes, he is, just a little bit. This is interesting. This is very interesting. Secondly, and more importantly, the basis of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition is wrong. At no stage have we agreed to anything with the Americans that will in any way weaken the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. At no stage have we agreed to anything with the Americans that would make it harder for generic drugs to come onto the market. The whole of the argument put forward by the Leader of the Opposition over the last week has been a complete smokescreen. The third thing is that it appears that Tuesday's child has been abandoned. When he announced that he needed these amendments, what the Leader of the Opposition said was that he wanted to stop dodgy patent claims. Bodgie, dodgy, shonky, sporadic or invalid - whatever you like - a patent claim speaks of a claim which is made to register a patent. I search in vain in this document entitled `ALP News Statements', which purportedly describes the amendments to be put forward by the opposition but does not contain the text of those amendments -  - Interjecting again! This is an amendment, is it? This is `ALP News Statements'. It says:The three amendments Labor will move in the Senate are to - Not `this is the text of the amendments'. I search in vain. -  - Oh, they have amendments and amendments. What I am saying to the Leader of the Opposition is that when we see the text of the amendments in the Senate then we will give a reaction. But from the description that has been given by the Leader of the Opposition, Tuesday's child has been abandoned and Thursday's child has been adopted. Tuesday's child was all about penalising shonky patent claims. On the Today show, with Tracy Grimshaw, we stopped talking about dodgy patent claims because we had been told that that was said in ignorance of how the law operated, and we are now talking about imposing penalties on companies that take out improper litigation in order to stop generic drugs coming onto the market - a vastly different proposition. At least we are making progress. We are making a little bit of progress and along the way the Leader of the Opposition is learning a little bit about the patent law of this country.We will have a look at the amendment when we finally see it. I point out that it is now 3.05 on Monday afternoon and we were told about this amendment at about 12.30 last Tuesday. We still do not have the text of the amendment, but at least we have an outline. That outline indicates that the Leader of the Opposition has shifted his ground big time since Tuesday. I welcome that, because it is in everybody's interest to have the free trade agreement passed. As I said on Friday, getting this free trade agreement passed is more important than any temporary political advantage for me or for the Leader of the Opposition.I would simply say this: this government have fought long and hard for this free trade agreement. We are very proud of what has been done by this government to get the free trade agreement. I place on record my great thanks to the Minister for Trade in particular for the tremendous work that he has done in order to secure the free trade agreement. Everybody who is the least bit objective in observing this debate knows that there is only one side of politics that could have negotiated a free trade agreement with the United States, and that is the Liberal and National parties. It would never have happened under a Labor government led by the current Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. The honourable member for Boothby does an excellent job and, like all members on this side of the House, he wanted to see the back of Saddam Hussein's regime. Whatever some former military officers and diplomats may say - and I am aware of a statement that the Prime Minister has been talking about that has been signed by some of these people, a number of whom are well-known and trenchant critics of the government, and have been since 1996 -  - the fact is that we do not regret for one minute the decision we took to contribute to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime. It was absolutely the right thing for Australia to do and for the coalition to do. You can stack up on one side of the ledger the opinions of the Leader of the Opposition and of the 43 people who signed some letter and of whoever it may be, but I put it to the House that, on the other side of the ledger, you should have another group of people: the people of Iraq. The people of Iraq do not agree with those people in Australia who think they would be better off under Saddam Hussein's regime. The people of Iraq do not think that. Whatever differences they may have and whatever problems there may be in Iraq, the people of Iraq are very glad that Saddam Hussein's regime has gone. - We have not cut and run. We still have some ADF personnel there. We on this side of the House are proud of the fact that an Australian C130 flew 48 Iraqi athletes out of Baghdad on their way to the Athens Olympics. Iraq had a team at the last Olympics, in Sydney. There were four members in that team, all of whom were, of course, answerable to Saddam Hussein's son, Uday. Iraqis are delighted that Saddam Hussein's regime has gone.There was no argument before the war in Iraq about whether Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. -  - After all, if the international community - and I do not just mean the British, the Americans and the Australians - did not think, before the war began on 17 March 2003, that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, why would the Security Council have passed unanimously resolution 1441? Why would the United Nations have sent inspectors back into Iraq? They did not send inspectors back to Iraq because they did not think Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. They are not threatening to send inspectors into Samoa or Fiji. They sent them into Iraq for a perfectly good reason.Another former diplomat, Phillip Flood, produced a report after going through all the evidence. In his case, it was not just an opinion; he went through all the evidence. In his report, Mr Flood said:... the only government in the world that claimed Iraq was not working on, and did not have, biological and chemical weapons or prohibited missile systems was the Government of Saddam Hussein.That is what Mr Flood said after he had been through all the information. He went on to say that proving the obverse conclusion - in other words, that Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction - `would have been a much more difficult conclusion to substantiate'.The Prime Minister quoted Michael Costello, another former secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Mr Costello was chief of staff to the Leader of the Opposition, and he stood for Labor Party preselection for the seat of Lowe, I think. It is not as though he is a fellow traveller of the Liberal Party; he often attacks the Liberal Party. On radio this morning, Mr Costello said, `It is not sustainable to say the government deceived people over the question of weapons of mass destruction.' The Prime Minister has quoted General Gration saying in 2002 that the world would be a better place if Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction. I will quote two other sources. The first is the former United Nations inspector and former diplomat, Mr Richard Butler, now Governor of Tasmania. He is somebody who, I believe, is a close friend of the Leader of the Opposition. I understand that Mr Butler and the Leader of the Opposition are very close friends. There is no point in laughing. You cannot get away from it: he is a close friend of yours. On 15 April 2003, Mr Butler said: `Do weapons of mass destruction exist in Iraq? No question.' Mr Butler was one of the primary advocates of the fact that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. - The member for Griffith interjects, as usual. He has been warned, by the way. The Labor Party's basic charge is that, before the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime, we had said that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and, in doing so, we misled the Australian people and therefore we are somehow culpable. But the Labor Party, I am sorry to reveal to the House, did exactly the same thing. On 15 October 2002, the member for Griffith told the Zionist Council of Victoria:Saddam Hussein possesses weapons of mass destruction. That is a matter of empirical fact.You cannot have the argument both ways. You cannot argue that we are being dishonest for saying that, having said it yourself. The member for Griffith, the Leader of the Opposition and all their fellow travellers made the argument that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction but that it was not worth getting rid of Saddam Hussein; it was not worth the effort. We disagreed on that point. Not only do we think that it was worth the effort; the Iraqis also agree with us - the Iraqis themselves are very glad that someone came to the party, had the courage to stand up to Saddam Hussein's regime and threw it out.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. There has been a lot of discussion and commentary in the media about the whole process of how well the government have protected the PBS in the free trade agreement. - In making that abundantly clear to the Australian people, we have identified a very salient point - that is, as part of the enabling legislation, there was no need to change any aspect of the PBS legislation, to add extra belts and braces to it, because it had been protected as far as the free trade agreement was concerned. The Leader of the Opposition has gone off on this issue of evergreening, which does take place in the United States, but it does not take place in Australia. I note that a press release has come out today in terms of the amendments that the Labor Party is proposing, which we are going to have a look at. But the legislation that the government have presented to this House - and it has been voted on by this House and is currently being debated in the Senate - will implement the free trade agreement. Also, the government are clearly of the view that this legislation absolutely protects the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson for his question. All along the member for Paterson has taken a very keen interest in the whole process of the free trade agreement. -  - He just wants to be able to reassure his constituents that they are going to receive the benefits of this agreement when it enters into force on 1 January 2005. All things being equal, it should pass the Senate this week, so it will be approved by the parliament. Last week, after five months of debate in the public arena and in this parliament, we saw the Labor Party finally acknowledge that this agreement is in the national interest. Following the caucus meeting last week, the Leader of the Opposition and his trade spokesman issued a press statement. Attachment C of that release was headed: `How the Australia-US free trade agreement passes the national interest test'. It listed subheadings: `Lowering manufacturing tariffs', meaning in the United States; `Improved agricultural access'; `Access to government procurement contracts'; `Greater service skills recognition'; and `More foreign investment'. That is from a Labor Party document, not a government document. That was released last week. That is exactly what we have been saying since we negotiated and concluded this agreement in January-February this year.When that statement was made, the Leader of the Opposition put qualifications on the Labor Party's support for the agreement going through the parliament. He foreshadowed that the Labor Party would be moving amendments to seek certain assurances from the government with regard to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the audiovisual sector. We have dealt with one of those, and today we see by press release the Labor Party's suggested amendments - we have not seen the actual amendments yet - to make safer, in their view, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. In our view, the legislation does not need anything more than what is already in it to secure the future of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.A very important point to make is that from Tuesday until today the position of the Labor Party has shifted. Last Tuesday they wanted amendments to patent law so that someone lodging a patent application that was regarded as spurious or dodgy could automatically be hit with a heavy penalty, and today - and I am reading from the press release - the Labor Party's amendments would:Require patent holding companies to issue a certificate when they seek to use the courts to block cheaper generic drugs coming to market. Patent companies will be required to certify that the legal action has been commenced in good faith ... That is not about applying for a patent; that is not about getting into a position where a patent is pending; that is not about a patent application that might be used to block a generic drug; that is not about spurious patent applications; it is about the certification process when you get to the courts to take out an injunction against a generic drug company. We welcome the fact that at last the Labor Party has sought legal advice and has drafted these amendments. We will have a look at them and respond in due course.In response to the Leader of the Opposition's questions about the access of generic drugs to the market, Mr Elmo de Alwis, the CEO of Australia's largest generic drug manufacturer, Sigma, said on the Business Sunday program that the FTA strengthens the PBS. He said:I don't think that there is a big downside to the PBS, I think it strengthens the PBS.That is the industry - the largest generic drug manufacturer in Australia - saying that. In conclusion, we have argued long and hard that this agreement is in the national interest. It is good to see that the Labor Party has now agreed that it is in the national interest, and we look forward to their support for it.</DOC>

 - I certainly do not concede that the certification proposals in the free trade agreement are a problem. I do not concede that at all. It is only today that the Labor Party seem to have a problem with these. Before, it was always about dodgy patent applications. It is only now that they have suddenly started to talk about the notification provision. Let me quote - as did my distinguished colleague the Minister for Trade - the chief executive of Sigma, the largest generic company in Australia, who said that he did not believe that the trade deal would: ... make it easier for drug companies to create bodgy patent applications. Any amendments that are brought in to close off loopholes are a good thing - and now he is talking about Labor - but, in this particular case, I do not necessarily know that this is a loophole. Evergreening is really nothing to do with the free trade agreement. Sigma's view is that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is not going to be impacted negatively as a result of this.The free trade agreement negotiated by this government is a good agreement. It is good for our economy, it is good for our consumers, and it is good for our PBS.Let me make it very clear to members opposite who have been spreading misleading statements, misinformation and downright lies about the PBS for the best part of six months: prices to consumers will not go up; the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme legislation will not change; the mechanisms for getting drugs onto the PBS are not affected at all; and cost-effectiveness remains the test for the listing of drugs. The PBS is a great scheme. It is being fully protected by this government as part of the free trade agreement and the sooner the legislation is passed the better for everyone.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question and I want to say that it is a particularly good one. May she ask questions of this quality every day. I point out to the member for Makin, and indeed to members opposite, that the Howard government's new Medicare safety net is the biggest structural improvement to Medicare since it was first brought in 20 years ago. Thanks to the MedicarePlus safety net, in a full year, more than one million Australians will receive higher Medicare benefits. More than one million Australians who face significant out-of-hospital, out-of-pocket expenses will receive higher Medicare benefits. That is 7,000 people on average in every single electorate around this country. Already more than half a million people are eligible for higher Medicare rebates thanks to the Howard government's brand new Medicare safety net. That is, on average, 3,000 people in every electorate around this country who are benefiting now thanks to the Howard government's safety net. They would lose that benefit - it would be ripped off them - if members opposite ever got into government.Let me give you some examples of real people who are enjoying benefits under the Howard government's safety net that would be ripped off them if there were a change of government. One patient with terminal bone cancer has received an additional $520 thanks to the Howard government's safety net. That would be gone under Labor. Another patient with chronic diabetes received an additional $385 thanks to the Howard government's safety net. That would be gone under Labor. A patient with a heart condition, who has a pacemaker, has received an extra $330 thanks to the Howard government's safety net. That would be gone under Labor. The Howard government's safety net is good policy. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition of something that he said in this House when he was mere member for Werriwa. He said:The methodology of good health reform is to get effective public safety net provisions in place ...That is what he said when he was a thinker and not just a political brawler. It is precisely what the Howard government has done. It is precisely what the Leader of the Opposition has forgotten because he needed to do a deal with the Left to assume the leadership. Let me make it very clear: the only political party in this parliament and the only political party in Australia which is promising to cut any health program is the Australian Labor Party. What that proves is that, when it comes to health, you can't trust Labor. The message from this side of the House to the other side of the House is: do whatever you want, but one thing don't do - don't mess with Medicare.</DOC>

 - I do not intend to add to the answer that I gave a moment ago. I have made my views very clear and I have dealt quite explicitly with the merits of the arguments that have been advanced by the 43 people. The 43 people comprise a mixture of people who have over the years been, in some cases, regular critics of this government. They include one person who accused the Royal Australian Navy and the Australian Federal Police of complicity in the drowning of 353 refugees. To expect for a moment that I am going to treat that person with the sort of reverence that is asked of me by the Leader of the Opposition - as far as I am concerned I have dealt with the merits of their arguments and, as far as the Leader of the Opposition is concerned, let me repeat: he is the last person in this building who has any moral authority to demand apologies in relation to personal insults.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question and acknowledge the wonderful work that he does for the electors in North Queensland. Today the National Australia Bank released its business survey for the month of July, showing business confidence increased for the third consecutive month. According to the bank's chief executive, Alan Oster:... the Australian economy started the second half of 2004 on a strong note. Indeed, the survey confirms that the recent re-acceleration of growth seems to have continued into July - with a positive spillover on business confidence.That is good news for the Australian economy. Business is confident, consumers are confident, interest rates are low, inflation is low and consumer confidence is driving great gains in employment. None of this happens by accident or by chance. Over the last eight years, the government has put in place a number of economic measures - which were opposed by the Australian Labor Party - which have built strength and resilience in our economy. The Australian Labor Party opposed the balancing of the budget. The Australian Labor Party opposed the pay-down of Australia's debt. It opposed our new monetary policy agreement. It opposed taxation reform. It opposed industrial relations reform. It opposed our privatisation. It opposed us on competition. If the Australian Labor Party had had its way, all of those things would have been at risk. I am asked what risks there are to the economic outlook in Australia. The biggest risk to the economic outlook in Australia would be the election of a Latham government. This is a Leader of the Opposition who has form, because the last time he got in control of an organ of government he engaged in unfunded spending, he drove up council rates, he left the budget in deficit, he engaged in developments which eventually sent the Liverpool City Council into bankruptcy, and he walked away.I reminded the House yesterday that the average interest rate under the Labor Party was 12 per cent. Interest rates are going up around the world at the moment. The United States lifted them in June. It may well lift them again overnight. The Bank of England lifted them a couple of weeks ago. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand lifted them a couple of weeks ago. There is a rising interest rate climate around the world and the last thing that Australia needs as its economic manager is the failed mayor of the Liverpool council. If Mr Latham were elected as Prime Minister, all Australian home buyers would wake up the next morning with a Liverpool kiss - the kiss of the management of the Liverpool council! Home buyers in Australia cannot afford another Liverpool kiss from another Liverpool mayor; they need good economic management and they need the return of a coalition government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question. I was rather interested in a report in today's Financial Review headed `Labor flags new research tax breaks'. It said: Opposition Leader Mark Latham has flagged major new incentives for private and public sector research and development, along with a return to the 150 per cent tax concession.I was rather interested in that proposal because I do recall reading an article in the Financial Review back in November 2000 headlined `Tax breaks don't lift R&amp;D: Forget industry welfare, says Mark Latham'.A government member - It must be a different bloke! - No, no. I am going to table this article from the Financial Review dated 27 November 2000. It said:Old economy incentives, such as the R&amp;D concessions, are aimed at the scale of research expenditure, rather than the formation of research partnerships. ... their effectiveness is highly questionable. With the reduction in the R&amp;D tax break from 150 to 125 per cent ... the Federal Government saved $450 million a year. The ... fall in business expenditure on research and development has been just $255 million ...Proposals to increase the concession can't be justified.So said Mr Mark Latham, `Tax breaks don't lift R&amp;D'. He also said:Every dollar of tax expenditure generates just 56c of additional private-sector effort.So there is a comprehensive repudiation of the Australian Labor Party policy, written by none other than the Leader of the Opposition himself.Can I just have another word in relation to this policy that comes from the authoritative source of Alan Ramsey in the Sydney Morning Herald. When the member for Werriwa supported the reduction of the 150 per cent R&amp;D tax concession, the member for Griffith, who smiles knowingly, was rather critical of him. This was written up in the Sydney Morning Herald on 4 November 2000. Alan Ramsey said:Kevin Rudd is .... from Queensland widely regarded amongst his colleagues as having an excellent opinion of himself ... Rudd made a learned speech in Parliament three days ago on what he described as the 'two classical measures', GERD and BERD.GERD is gross expenditure on research and development and BERD is business expenditure on research and development. In the course of that, he criticised the member for Werriwa, who supported the reduction of the tax concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent as a bad investment in business welfare, as I have already said. Alan Ramsey records as follows:So what did Latham do when he learnt that Rudd had given him a flick? He opened up his new gee-whiz laptop computer issued to all MPs over the past year ... and sent a blistering email to his colleague down the corridor which began, 'Hey, knucklehead!'Seeing as we are in the business of apologies today, maybe the member for Werriwa would like to apologise for calling the member for Griffith `knucklehead'. Labor's policy of returning to the 150 per cent R&amp;D tax concession is the revenge of the knucklehead! The knucklehead was the person who criticised the member for Werriwa for taking it out, and he must be laughing all the way - to the egg over the face of the member for Werriwa - that he has now seen his own position endorsed.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question and acknowledge his support for the free trade agreement for the duration of the time we have been negotiating it. He raises a very important aspect of the free trade agreement - that is, improved market access for dairy products into that incredibly valuable American market. I am sure he is aware that just recently the Australian Dairy Farmers announced that they wanted to see the free trade agreement pass through the parliament as quickly as possible so they could prepare for that increased market access and get tooled up in terms of exporting there. In their press release they said: Until this legislation passes through the Parliament there will continue to be uncertainty about the 3-fold increase in dairy product access to the USA.They are concerned about the uncertainty that still exists here, notwithstanding that the agreement has passed all the legislative processes in the Congress in the United States. They went on to say in their release:The industry has estimated the trade will be worth between $2,000 and $3,000 per farmer in the first year but this will only be realized if dairy companies can start now to develop the relationships they need to maximize the value of the new quota access to the US market.Mr Speaker, we have continually said that this deal is a good deal for Australia's agricultural producers, particularly the dairy farmers across Australia, who so badly need this extra access and that extra income per farm per year to help their circumstances.For the information of the member for Eden-Monaro, Bega Cheese, a company in his electorate, in 1996 employed around 100 people. Today it employs over 500 people, with an increasing focus on exports. The FTA will support that and give the company opportunities to expand and generate more jobs in that regional part of the member's electorate.As we have continued to say, the free trade agreement provides the opportunity to generate 30,000 new jobs in the Australian economy and add $6 billion to the GDP of this country after 10 years. That is certainly worth pursuing. The government have pursued it because we believe that it is in the national interest. The FTA will deepen our trade and investment relationship with the largest economy in the world. The US is the world's largest market. It has a GDP of almost $US11 trillion. It is the world's largest importer. It is the world's largest investor and the world's largest purchaser of goods and services.For the first time, this agreement gives Australian industry access to the $200 billion US federal government procurement market but also to a further $200 billion state government procurement market. In recent weeks, two more states of the United States, Michigan and Illinois, have signed on to the government procurement chapter - very important markets for Australian manufacturing industries.Two-thirds of US tariffs on agricultural products will be eliminated on day one and after four years 75 per cent of agricultural tariffs will be eliminated. That will provide the much needed market access that I spoke about for the dairy industry, which will also accrue to other industries like lamb, beef and tuna. Over 97 per cent of US tariffs on Australia's manufacturing exports will be eliminated on day one, with the automotive, metals, minerals, seafood, paper and chemical sectors receiving an immediate boost and new opportunities for new business.Most importantly, as our services sector grows in terms of its value to the Australian economy, as of 1 January next year under the US free trade agreement the United States will not be able to discriminate against Australian service providers competing in their market in favour of their service providers. We will be provided with national treatment in that market. That is the growth sector of our exporting industries and it is important that we know that.It is little wonder the government unanimously support this agreement. In the last couple of weeks we have seen the Labor Party coming very, very slowly - almost being dragged to the box - to support this agreement. Then they put out their statement last week outlining why it is in the national interest. We accept that and we agree with everything that they say as to why it is in the national interest, just as I have outlined. The Labor Party have provided qualified support; we have outlined why it is in the national interest. The Labor Party themselves have outlined why it is in the national interest. We now need the Senate to get on and vote it through to deliver those 30,000 new jobs in the Australian economy and to grow our economy by $6 billion. </DOC>

 - I cannot from my own knowledge confirm; I can only assume that newspaper reports that appeared are correct. Do I intend to embrace Labor's policy? No. Do I think it is always a bad thing for a former minister to be engaged in working for a company which covers an area for which he previously had ministerial responsibility? No. It would depend on the circumstances and it would depend on the propriety of the minister. I have to say to the Leader of the Opposition that the adoption of an arbitrary time of 12 months is nothing more than what it is: an arbitrary period of time. If a former minister is a proper person, in my view there is no reason why that person cannot take up a position with a company, providing information that has come to the knowledge of that person is not disclosed. It matters not whether it is taken up within six months or, indeed, three years.I am quite sure that former communications ministers in Labor governments - now some 8½ years distant from their time in government - still retain inside knowledge. It is a question of personal behaviour and personal integrity. I am not casting any aspersions on individual ministers. I am certainly not casting any aspersions on Richard Alston, who I thought was an outstanding communications minister and a person of enormous integrity who has a great understanding.There is an old saying that you cannot legislate morality if there is no instinct for it. Rules in this area are nothing more than the setting of arbitrary periods of time. They cannot alter the character of people's behaviour. I do not think for a moment that the proposal put forward by the Leader of the Opposition is going to lead to more honourable and correct conduct if there is no instinct for that honourable and correct conduct. I believe in that very strongly, so the answer is: no, I will not be adopting Labor's 12-month policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Canning for his question, the interest he has in the free trade agreement and, indeed, more than that, the support he provides for that agreement because he knows it is good for Western Australia and for his particular constituents. This agreement is good for Australia because it links Australia more closely with the world's most dynamic economy. It will give us immediate duty-free access for over 97 per cent of our merchandise exports to the United States market. That is an enormous benefit for Australia. It eliminates nearly all United States tariffs on auto products, including the 25 per cent tariff on utes. Obviously General Motors Holden in Adelaide and Ford in Victoria are particularly pleased about that. The 50 per cent ship repair tariff will be eliminated as well. These are just examples of how industries in a number of our electorates and a number of our states will be specifically very much better off. Almost two-thirds of agricultural tariffs erected against, amongst others, Australian imports into the United States will go immediately and an additional nine per cent will go four years after the free trade agreement comes into force. That means, for example, tariffs on lamb and tuna exports will go altogether. That will give our farmers and our seafood industry very much better access to the American market. Obviously it means jobs; it means investment; and it means prosperity for those communities.It gives open access for Australian companies to the $200 billion market for United States federal government procurement. We do not have access to that market now, but we will have access to a market worth $200 billion. That obviously is an enormous benefit. I think about 30 states have also agreed to enter into this arrangement. The fact is that the benefits to Australia of this free trade agreement are simply enormous. I note other countries are desperately trying to negotiate a similar agreement with the United States. A handful have succeeded: obviously, Canada and Mexico; Chile has succeeded; and there are one or two other countries. But there are many on the waiting list. One of the arguments that perhaps those opposite, so many of whom oppose the free trade agreement with United States, have not reflected on is that those countries which do have free trade agreements with the United States have preferential access compared to Australia. If we knock this back, that means that the Chileans, the Canadians, the Mexicans and so on, in the same industry sectors, will have an advantage over Australian exporters. If the free trade agreement with the Americas comes into force then the whole of Latin America will have a better access arrangement to the US market than Australia, if we in the end do not support the free trade agreement.I was asked whether there are any alternative views on this issue. It is quite interesting. There was a question earlier about Liberal candidates. Labor candidates, interestingly enough, are running around the country telling people that they are opposed to the free trade agreement. I do not read the Blue Mountains Gazette every day or every week, whereas I am sure the member for Macquarie, the Chief Government Whip, does. In the Blue Mountains Gazette of Wednesday, 4 August, the Labor candidate for the seat of Macquarie made a desperate bid for populism. He was following on the lead, of course, of the Leader of the Opposition himself, who said on 9 February this year that he would oppose the free trade agreement - that was when he used to oppose the free trade agreement. The Labor candidate for Macquarie has come out and said that not only will he oppose the free trade agreement now and continue to campaign on the basis of being opposed to it but, in the event that he gets elected to parliament - frankly, if the excellent representation that Macquarie currently has is downgraded, and I do not believe this will happen - he will continue to campaign against the free trade agreement in parliament. This is what you have with the Labor Party: a leader who on 9 February set the tone - part of his old anti-American cry - saying that his gut reaction was to oppose the free trade agreement. That was his first position. He has had four positions on the free trade agreement since then, coupled, by the way, with his nine positions on troops out by Christmas -   - I will come back later in the day to some of his other positions, but the Leader of the Opposition has a lot of positions. He sets the tone for the party and for the candidates: candidates are running around trying to get votes off government members by claiming that they are against the free trade agreement and they are campaigning on that basis. Labor should disendorse their candidate in Macquarie, if they believe so passionately in the free trade agreement. This is a big issue on which there is to be a vote in the Senate later this week. All I can say is that the confusion in the opposition on this issue is as a result of the tone set by their leader. The Leader of the Opposition himself is erratic and unpredictable, and I think Australians are increasingly becoming aware of that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hotham for his question. Residential aged care, including aged care services and accommodation, is defined under the Aged Care Act as GST free. For example, for residents in nursing homes, their nursing services, accommodation and meals are GST free. Retirement village residents in serviced apartments and independent living units are not GST free. That is the legislation and that is the policy which the government announced. The ruling in relation to the applicable act turns on whether or not a person is living in a retirement village or independent living as opposed to living in residential aged care. The tax office and, indeed, the law look at numbers of indicia to decide the difference in relation to those matters. Various rulings have been given and the legislation has been drawn accordingly. Those taxpayers who wish clarification from the tax office of course are entitled to seek it, and the tax office is willing to give assistance in relation to those definitions.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question. He does an excellent job up there in the Northern Territory, and he is a strong believer in the government's border security policies. The government ratified the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime and its Protocol Against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air on 27 May, and once the new anti-trafficking offences have been enacted the government will ratify the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. What these treaties do is build on the international framework that we are contributing to the development of to combat the transnational crime of people-smuggling and to facilitate greater regional cooperation in this area. What we have done through the Bali process, cohosted by Australia and Indonesia, has been frankly extraordinary in terms of taking steps to address people-smuggling.We as a government have also taken steps to strengthen our aerial security capability. The Prime Minister announced last month, very recently, a $135 million package to do that and a week or so earlier a $102 million package on maritime security. The fact is that the government's policy of improved border security, deterrence and regional cooperation has worked. Not a single boat with illegal migrants has arrived in Australia since March 2004 and only three have come to Australia since December 2001. Some of these policies have been tough and some of them have been controversial, but the point is that they have been extraordinarily successful and I think the public recognise that.Are there any alternative approaches? Yes, the Labor Party have several alternative approaches. The first of their approaches is to take the Navy off the job. The Navy have been doing an excellent job, and the Labor Party's policy is to take the Navy off the job and to create something which is euphemistically called a coastguard. We know what the coastguard really is: the coastguard is Labor's coast guide. It is called a coast guide because they do not want to stop anyone coming to Australia; they want to meet them and bring them into Australia. That is the plan. A coastguard is to stop; a coast guide is to welcome, and that is what the Labor Party have in mind. It would be all very well if the Labor Party had just one policy on this issue, but under the frankly erratic and unpredictable leadership of the Leader of the Opposition - phrases I think you will hear a little more of over the next few weeks - they have had nine policies on troops out by Christmas, five policies on the US free trade agreement but so far only three policies on the coast guide, on the so-called protection of Australia, through the scrapping of the Navy's role in guarding our borders. Policy No. 1, which was announced by the Labor Party in November 2002, was to buy three motorboats, call them a coastguard and have them replace the Navy's role. Then they decided that was not good enough, so back in March this year the member for Barton - and he will remember all of this - had policy No. 2, which was to add to the three motorboats 10 other boats without additional funding. Honourable members may recall that these boats were to be so small we dubbed them the water taxis. The strength of these boats was that they were to have helicopters and that in the helicopters were to be snipers, and the snipers were going to shoot the engines of the people smugglers' boats and stop those boats so that the water taxis could then go, pick the people up and take them off the boats. That was policy No. 2. By the way, on 30 June - the last day of the financial year - this policy was scrapped and a new policy was developed. Two hundred million dollars was to be saved in the new policy. Labor introduced their new cut-price coast guide policy, where they would cut the number of boats down to eight and just rent some boats. They are going to rent a few boats and - surprise, surprise! - the Labor Party have abandoned the armed snipers. There are to be no armed snipers. -  - I know; it would have been great for cartoons, it would have been great for our constituents. The Labor armed sniper policy has been abandoned. It is, if I may say so, surely a sign of weakness that you have abandoned your armed sniper policy. Now we have a heap of little motorboats buzzing around in order to guide people in, but there are not as many as before; we have gone down to eight rented boats. There is to be no Navy, just eight rented boats patrolling 37,000 kilometres of coastline. You scrap the Navy's role, and that is called doubling. If I may say so, Labor's cut-price coast guide policy will be a failed policy. All it is is one giant invitation to the people smugglers to reopen business.</DOC>

 - In the last federal budget the government made a commitment to continue our funding to the financial counselling services. We recognise the valuable role that they play in many rural communities, particularly in times of drought and when there is trouble in particular industries. There have been no cutbacks in Commonwealth funding for the financial counselling services. Whether there are particular difficulties in an individual service is a matter I am not aware of, but if the honourable member cares to give me more details about the circumstances of that particular service I will follow it up. I can assure the House that the Commonwealth is committed to the financial counselling services and that funding is in place for the term of the forward estimates. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. I know that he is very interested in this matter, as are all members. The government's desire is quite clear: it is to protect the institution of marriage. Our position is unequivocal on that. The Marriage Amendment Bill 2004 reflects fundamental concerns in the community that the institution of marriage is being eroded. These are not matters of hypothetical concern, as has been suggested in some quarters. - These are not matters of hypothetical concern; let me just say that. We know of at least two applications currently before our courts seeking the validation in Australia of same-sex marriages performed in Canada. The government believes that these matters should be made clear, that the parliament should put the matters beyond doubt. The bill that has been passed by this chamber and is now in another place awaiting consideration simply reinforces what is commonly accepted as the definition of marriage - that is, the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life. One would believe that this is the view of the Labor Party, because the shadow Attorney-General, the member for Gellibrand, had this to say at a forum here in Canberra last week:Let me make it clear. Labor does not support gay marriage. Labor supports the institution of marriage as an important social, and for many a religious, union between a man and a woman.That did not seem to me to be ambiguous, but, when you weigh it up against what others seem to be saying and when you weigh it up against the actions that they have taken, you might well have some doubts. I read a report in the Australian today that there was some discussion about this at a Labor caucus yesterday - An opposition member - There wasn't a Labor caucus yesterday. - On Monday. - We might have heard a wider spectrum of views if it had been the caucus, but I stand corrected; it was the shadow cabinet, in what we are told was an escalated 90-minute fight over Labor's support for the ban on gay marriage. The report mentions the member for Grayndler, the member for Bruce, the member for Melbourne and Senator Kate Lundy. What I find interesting in relation to these comments is that it is asserted on the other side that `all candidates should support our policies'. There appears to be a variety of views in relation to this matter. If you read the same article further on, you find that some people are holding out to others that the Labor Party has another position. The same article refers to a Labor MP, who would not be named, who said that Ms Roxon deserved a dressing-down for her comments. He said: She didn't need to go that far. We had convinced the gay and lesbian community that we were on their side and she went and insulted them.I do not know where the Labor Party stand on these matters, but it seems to me that they are trying to walk both sides of the street. What I think we need to see from the Leader of the Opposition is leadership on this issue.I found another quote from the honourable member for Gellibrand. The honourable member for Gellibrand, speaking about the bill going to the Senate, on radio station 2CC here in Canberra on 5 August, had this to say:So when it gets presented to us, we will vote for it. We have never said anything otherwise to the gay community or to the broader community.What we know is that, when the bill went from this chamber and was presented to the Senate, at the first available opportunity the Labor Party voted against the first reading. - If they were serious and were going to deal with it at the first opportunity they would have dealt with it then. You will have another opportunity to do so, and we will see where you stand then.</DOC>

 - For the benefit of the member for Lalor, let me just remind her that this government has an absolutely outstanding record on immunisation. When members opposite were in power, child immunisation rates had fallen as low as 50 per cent. We had Third World level child immunisation rates. Now we are the best of the best, with our child immunisation rates at over 90 per cent. - Back in 1996, just $13 million was spent on vaccination. This year, $143 million will be spent on vaccination, and next year over $250 million will be spent on vaccination, thanks to the policies of the Howard government. I have written to ATAGI. I have asked them to reconsider their recommendation on the polio vaccine. Let me say that children are vaccinated against polio. It is not that people are not vaccinated against polio; the big issue that the member for Lalor has cottoned onto is whether it is one type of polio vaccine or another type of polio vaccine. - I have written, on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer, asking for ATAGI to reconsider in the light of the decision by several countries not to change from one polio vaccine to the other polio vaccine -  - until we have made more progress in eliminating polio in the wild.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question and, in response to him, recall that when this government came to office in 1996 it inherited a complex and complicated award system that hindered jobs and wages in Australia. The government set about bringing about flexibility and choice in the workplace, which has resulted in 1.3 million extra jobs and higher real wages for Australians. This means greater security for Australians and their families. Part of the government's record on award simplification includes setting aside some 1,480 awards and seeing 1,220 awards being simplified since 1997. Indeed, the number of employees who rely primarily on awards has fallen from 67.6 per cent in May 1990 to just over 20 per cent in May 2002.The member for Cowper asked me about proposals to reregulate the system in Australia. What we have from the Leader of the Opposition is a policy proposition to reintroduce the comprehensive award system by removing the cap on 20 allowable matters for awards. What this means for the member for Cowper includes things like the commercial travellers award in New South Wales, which requires employers to notify the union if they want to employ someone. To take another example of the complexity of awards, the plumbers and gasfitters state consolidated award - again in New South Wales - refers to conveniences and says:The employer shall provide on each place of work sanitary conveniences ......	...	...They shall be at least one metre wide and one and a half metres long and two metres high internal measurement and shall have a hinge door capable of being fastened both inside and on the outside.So it is not good enough if it is 1.4 metres long; it has to be 1.5 metres. You cannot have a sliding door; you have to have a hinged door. It is these sorts of absurd minutiae in awards that I am talking about. - I hear the honourable member for Melbourne interjecting. I was reading a book recently. This book was described on its back cover by former Prime Minister Paul Keating as a sharp analysis and by the former National President of the Labor Party, Barry Jones, as a thoughtful analysis. I was looking through this book last night and I came across this section. It says:Awards contain detailed prescriptions covering most issues of the employment contract, down to matters such as bicycle allowances and the provision of boiling water. - It is interesting how the member for Melbourne is interjecting, because the author of this book went on to say:In the one-dimensional world of the industrial age, this comprehensive prescription was sustainable. He then went on to say:This is no longer acceptable today and it's something which we have to change.The author is Lindsay Tanner, the member for Melbourne. So it is not just the government, John Edwards, the Business Council and the ACCI complaining about the regressive policy of the Leader of the Opposition. Even the member for Melbourne says that this is an absurd situation to go back to.I read that the Leader of the Opposition yesterday said to the Australian Industry Group forum:I talk around the business community with trade unions. I don't detect any extremism or any desire that there's going to be an outbreak of industrial agitation and action.That once again demonstrates his lack of attention to detail. If he were more experienced, he would know what the unions are actually saying. For example, the union bosses at the CFMEU have been reported two or three times in the media over the last few days. One said, `My members will have everything that was taken out and then some.' So whether you are a hairdresser employing people or whether you are an employee of a hairdresser in Australia, your job prospects, your wages and your income in the future are under threat from this massive reregulation of the award system under the Labor Party policy. -  - They always make a lot of noise when they know that it is actually hurting them. - There is a stark contrast between what the Australian Labor Party would do in government and what this coalition government is doing. You have a Leader of the Opposition who has produced a job-destroying workplace relations policy. That compares to the policies of this government, which have produced more jobs, higher wages for Australians and lower interest rates, and that means security for Australians and their families. That is what we remain committed to and it is what the Labor Party would destroy.</DOC>

I am advised that, at that July meeting, ATAGI laid down a program under which it will reconsider its recommendations in respect of the polio vaccine and the chickenpox vaccine. I expect to have ATAGI's new advice before the end of the year.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson for his question. He is an indefatigable fighter for small businesses in the Hunter region, in stark contrast to the member for Hunter, who has been involved with small businesses from time to time. But we are not going to go there. There is great news from a Dun and Bradstreet survey today. Australian businesses are very optimistic regarding the sales and profit outlook for the December quarter of 2004. That is a positive story. It is an example of what freeing up the workplace does. It creates flexibility that allows people to focus on making money, improving real wages and delivering real profits. That is what we are about. We believe in the capitalist system. We believe that people who work hard should be properly rewarded. That is why we introduced AWAs. More than 500,000 AWAs have been issued since we introduced the policy. The Labor Party is going to abolish AWAs. -  - `Hear, hear,' they say - my goodness! In their stealth policy released on Friday, which they were hoping would get underneath the radar, they said that Labor would provide for effective, workable streams of union and non-union collective agreements. I ask myself: what is a non-union collective agreement? The member for Rankin, that wise old soul over there, claims that, basically, Latham Labor are going to copy the New South Wales system and adopt non-union collective agreements. Under the New South Wales Industrial Relations Act, in that state the unions have to be involved in non-union agreements. - Yes. Can you believe that, Mr Speaker? - In New South Wales the unions must be invited as a third party with a right to object to agreements reached between employees and employers. So, if a baker wants to have a non-union agreement with his staff, he has to ask the unions for their opinion on it. If a real estate agent wants to negotiate an agreement with his or her staff, they have to bring in the unions and seek their approval, even if it is a non-union agreement. -  - It is absolutely true! And guess what? In New South Wales, of the 40,000 certified agreements, only 40 are non-union. What a surprise! It must have been union picnic day that day. How did 40 get through? This is the Labor Party's idea of industrial relations: in every small business, be it a real estate agency, a bakery, a coffee shop or a plumbing firm, the union movement will be at the table. They will be right in there in hand-to-hand combat with employers and employees. The losers out of that will be the workers because they will not be getting the real wage increases that are delivered by a flexible workplace, which can be delivered only by the Howard government.</DOC>

 - In relation to James Hardie, let me make it quite clear that any company which has been found to have reorganised its affairs to prevent the fulfilment of its obligations to former employees has behaved reprehensibly, and I have no qualification or equivocation in saying that. I have indicated that. The Treasurer has indicated that. But I also point out that there is a process under way, and that process is a commission of inquiry established by the New South Wales government. I also point out to the Leader of the Opposition that the rearrangement which has been spoken of was approved by the Supreme Court of New South Wales, and the appropriate thing is to wait until we get the findings of the commission. Then - and then only - I believe there should be an appropriate response. But let me make it clear as a general principle that we will have no truck with any corporation in this country that is found to have rearranged its affairs to frustrate its legal obligation to its former employees. But, equally, we have no truck with political parties that rort rents to enrich themselves. If the Leader of the Opposition wanted a bit of high ground on political donations he would learn how to spell Centenary House.</DOC>

 - First of all, I notice the Labor Party says there are not any weapons of mass destruction. I wish I lived in that world. I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question and for asking about a serious issue. Ever since we came to office, the government have taken strong and even, one could say, enthusiastic steps to deal with the issue of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It was our government that brought the comprehensive test ban treaty to the United Nations General Assembly in September 1996 and had it passed by a massive majority in the General Assembly to become part of the international non-proliferation regime. We did help to rid the world of Saddam Hussein, the only head of government in office at that time who had used weapons of mass destruction and the only one in history who has used weapons of mass destruction against his own people. We have been a core member of the Proliferation Security Initiative, designed to interdict so that countries are not able to trade in illicit weapons of mass destruction materials. We have supported Security Council resolution 1540 to criminalise the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction materials, and we have been a very high profile member of the international community in other ways in promoting weapons of mass destruction related export controls, especially in our capacity as the chair of the Australia Group. Next week I will be going to North Korea, and I will do what I can to try to encourage the North Koreans to abandon their nuclear programs along the lines that have been put forward by five members of the six-party talks. Today I have here in Canberra the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council - the chief foreign policy maker of Iran, I suppose you could say. We have already had one round of talks, and we will be meeting again this evening. On our agenda, amongst other issues, is Iran's nuclear program. Obviously we want to see Iran fully cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency and fulfil all of its obligations under the International Atomic Energy Agency. I do not think even the government's worst critics - and most of them are sitting across from me - would say that this government has not been highly active in dealing with the issue of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.Are there any alternative policies? Yes, there are alternative policies. There are the policies of the opposition. The member for Griffith said back in February of last year that the Labor Party would produce a foreign policy white paper before the next election so we could see what Labor's approach to these issues would be. The foreign policy white paper is apparently somewhat delayed, so we await its appearance. In any case, short of the white paper appearing, there are a couple of Labor policies on non-proliferation that I have detected. First of all, apparently the Labor Party opposes the Proliferation Security Initiative. There are 60 countries that now support it, but the Labor Party apparently opposes it - presumably because the Proliferation Security Initiative was originally an American idea and therefore it is a bit suspicious.However, the Labor Party does have another policy, which it announced three years ago. I have checked the web site, and it has not been changed. It said that on the election of a Labor government it would establish a new equivalent of the Canberra Commission - that is, a commission of distinguished people who would look into how the weapons of mass destruction agenda can be taken forward. I thought to myself: that is quite an interesting initiative, because the Keating government had the Canberra Commission. I had another look at this Labor Party initiative - and it is still its policy today - and who is the Labor Party going to appoint as the chairman of its committee of inquiry? Richard Butler, the former governor, is the man whom it has identified as the chairman of its new Canberra Commission. The former opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, the member for Kingsford Smith, who announced this policy, said that Richard Butler is the right person because he has the track record and the form. He has a bit of money as well, so I hope he will do this job gratis. I think $650,000 should cover him for this job as well.The member for Kingsford Smith also noted that Mr Butler `indicated that he would have the time and all the commitment to give this initiative of ours a good deal of endeavour'. So it brings to light something. It brings to light the secret meeting in Hobart, I think it was in March, between the Leader of the Opposition and Richard Butler, all officials pushed out of the room, just Mark and Richard together, just the two of them obviously - it is obvious what was happening - confirming the Canberra Commission job. It is obvious. But I just ask the Labor Party, when they do become the government: please do not pay him; he has enough money already. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dickson for his question. In the increasing debate about the opposing industrial relations policies of the two sides of politics in Australia, it is relevant to ask the question: what is the track record of the policies that have been applied over the last 8½ years? Those who advocate a radical departure from the last 8½ years have the burden of demonstrating that their policies would produce a better outcome than the policies that we have followed.Over the last 8½ years we have seen 1.3 million new jobs; we have seen unemployment fall from 8½ per cent to 5½ per cent; we have seen the number of federal electorates with double digit unemployment fall from 35 to only four; we have seen massive increases in real wages - 14 per cent increases in real wages over 8½ years compared with 2.9 per cent, miserably, over 13 years under the previous government. Also, interestingly - because we have been able to sustain real wage rises and, through the linkage of pension adjustments to male total average weekly earnings, have been able to sustain those increases - one of the by-products of this has been not only the increase in real wages but also a greater increase sustainably in the old age pension than would otherwise have been the case. Over the last years, as a result of that linkage, the old age pension is $40 a fortnight higher than would otherwise have been the case.It is all very well for critics of that comment to say, `Well, that's the result of the increase in nominal wages.' The point is that if you can sustain increases in nominal wages - and that is through containing inflation, which we have been able to do because of the rises in productivity - you can therefore sustainably see rises in the pension. So not only do you have 1.3 million new jobs, not only do you have a 14 per cent increase in real wages, not only do you have significant reductions in interest rates, not only do you have a significant reduction in the number of electorates with double-digit unemployment but, because of the success of this policy, you have also been able to sustain significant increases in the old age pension.The member for Dickson asks me, `Is that at risk?' Yes, it is at risk. It is at risk if Labor's policy is introduced. Labor's policy would undo the productivity gains of the last 8½ years. You cannot deny the fact that in 13 years real wages rose by 2.9 per cent under Labor; in 8½ years under us real wages have risen by 14 per cent. Why has that happened? It has happened because we have had higher productivity. It is because we cleaned up the waterfront; it is because we stared down the MUA and cleaned up the waterfront. It is because we have seen a significant rise in labour productivity in the market sector. That will be threatened by the abolition of Australian workplace agreements. It will be threatened if you give unions greater power of entry. Why, I ask, at a time when 17½ per cent of the private sector work force of this country chooses to belong to a union should you hand back control of industrial relations to the organised trade union movement? That is the question that defies logic. Perhaps if 50.1 per cent of the work force belonged to a trade union you could justify handing back 100 per cent of control over the industrial relations system to the unions; but how on earth can you justify doing it with only 17½ per cent? What the Australian people have been saying to the trade unions of this country over the years is: `Yes, we choose to join or not to join your ranks. We no longer think you are relevant to our future. We are prepared to live in an industrial relations environment that gives us the opportunity of higher wages, lower interest rates, more jobs, better pensions.' These are all benefits of our industrial relations policy, and Labor would undo it all in the name of something that was the subject of the first two questions asked by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is talking about the donations from a particular company; I remind him of the $40 million of donations from the trade union movement - the $40 million which has bought an industrial relations policy that will destroy the magnificent performance of this economy over the last 8½ years.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. As expected - as I informed the House yesterday - the US Federal Reserve overnight increased interest rates again. That followed a move by the Bank of England last week to increase interest rates. Central banks in Switzerland and New Zealand have also recently increased interest rates. It confirms that global interest rates will be rising through the course of the next 12 months. That being the case, it is very important that economic management in Australia be strong. It is very important that experienced economic management continues, because the last thing that Australia would want would be a return to the interest rates of the Labor government between 1983 and 1996.If you think of the worst-run council in Australia and the mayor who presided over the worst-run council in Australia, what would you think of a proposition to make that mayor Prime Minister? That would be a Liverpool kiss to the economic prospects of Australia. Today consumer sentiment data was released that shows, according to the Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey, that consumer confidence continued at another decade high in the last month. Most components of the consumer sentiment index rose, including perceptions of family finances, economic conditions and economic conditions over the next five years.It was noted that probably one of the main reasons why perceptions of family finances have risen so strongly is because of the number of Australian families who have recently received an additional $600 per child in order to help with the bills. We recognise that many families have bills which are much greater than that. I point out to the House that the $600 per child is not the total amount of assistance. For low-income families the annual assistance is $4,000 per child, and for others it is around $1,600 - that is the minimum rate. So the $600 is just a component that was added into already existing family assistance by way of an annual bonus, as it were. That has really helped Australian families. As far as the government is concerned, we think it is appropriate that Australian families be helped. But there has been an ominous silence from the Australian Labor Party about that $600 payment.  - The member for Ballarat interjects, but she is part of a political party which will not guarantee that $600 if it is elected. The Australian Labor Party has guaranteed that $600 for as long as the coalition is in office, and it is holding back the prospect of taking it away. Why would a political party want to take $600 away from the families of Australia? Why would they want to make family life harder for the families of Australia? We call on the Australian Labor Party, which is now three months overdue on its tax policy, having promised it in budget week, to come out and to match this government on its commitment of that $600 per child per annum whilst ever it should get into office. Until such time as it can match the coalition in relation to that, Labor stands condemned as the party which will not look after Australian families and will not give them the support that they deserve.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the article in the Bulletin magazine today. I point out that a number of the matters in that article have been raised before and more current information is, in fact, available. All four of the current aged care homes cited by the Bulletin are now fully compliant with all 44 outcomes required under the accreditation process introduced by this government. On coming to office, because there was nothing in place under Labor, this government put in place a comprehensive regulatory framework to ensure that the highest standard quality care would be delivered in aged care homes. We introduced an accreditation system. This was the first national legislated quality assurance program this country had seen. In its 13 years in government, Labor did not address a national quality assurance program. We introduced certification to ensure that aged care homes reached specific building standards. That was not introduced under Labor. We introduced a complaints resolution scheme and a freecall number so that if any resident, family member or staff member had a concern or complaint it could be raised, even anonymously. We introduced the position of a commissioner for complaints, who has a role in mediating and negotiating outcomes as a result of complaints. We introduced a charter of residents' rights and responsibilities. None of this existed under Labor. Aged care providers are required to meet these high standards at law. Aged care is now well supervised, well monitored and very well subsidised. In the last budget, over $2.2 billion was allocated to residential aged care, the largest single funding package for aged care by any government at any time. This means that from today until 2008 over $30 billion of taxpayers' funds will be invested in the aged care sector. That funding was designed to ensure that more funds are available by way of care subsidies to meet the cost of care, more funds are available for education and training, more funds are available for capital and more places are available to meet the needs of older Australians.Instances of poor care are never acceptable but, under the system this government has introduced, instances of poor care are detected and acted upon. Poor compliance is worked on until it becomes good compliance. Instead of Labor always knocking the aged care sector and, by inference, casting aspersions on the aged care work force - the skilled and dedicated workers who provide the love, care and support for older Australians - it ought to release an aged care policy. This government is delivering on a world-class system of aged care that is high-quality, affordable and accessible, and we will keep on getting on with the job of caring for older Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. We have always held that opening up opportunities in the markets of the world through bilateral negotiations, such as the free trade agreement we have concluded with the United States, would help the economy of Australia and generate more jobs. It has been forecast that the United States free trade agreement, when in full force, will generate 30,000 new jobs in the Australian economy. That certainly is a worthwhile objective for any government and country to pursue. If you add that to our government's track record over the last eight years of adding 1.3 million jobs to the Australian economy, it is a very important objective. And that goes for the other bilateral negotiations that we have pursued. Of course, it has been a hallmark of the government's trade policy to pursue our bilateral agenda as well as maintaining energy and focus on multilateral arrangements through the World Trade Organisation. When our government was elected in 1996, we had to start repairing the damage to our relationship with Malaysia that had been done by the Keating government. It has taken a number of years, but the success of that work was evident the week before last, when I announced that Australia and Malaysia will conduct parallel scoping studies on a possible free trade agreement between our two countries. Malaysia is a very important trading partner of Australia in South-East Asia, and at last we are getting that relationship moving seriously forward. This would not have been possible under a Labor government. This comes just months after the ASEAN economic ministers proposed a possible free trade agreement between the ASEAN countries, Australia and New Zealand. In July this year we signed a free trade agreement with Thailand which is scheduled to enter into force early in 2005. Given union opposition, this would not have been possible under a Labor government.In July 2003 Australia's free trade agreement with Singapore came into force and it was the second only free trade agreement in Australia's history. Already that agreement is delivering benefits to many exporting businesses in Australia. In July 2003 we concluded a trade and economic framework with Japan, our largest export market. In October 2003 we began the scoping study on a free trade agreement with China, the fastest-growing economy in the world. In June this year the United Arab Emirates agreed to pursue a free trade agreement with Australia.What has the Labor Party done for trade? Labor's policy remains with an absolute focus on the multilateral system. None of those achievements would have been possible under a Labor government in Australia. Labor has never negotiated a bilateral free trade agreement. Labor's trade policy is dictated to it by the union movement, as its division over the US free trade agreement clearly indicates. Job creation through trade liberalisation is a hallmark of the coalition government in the eight years we have been in office. The union opposition to trade liberalisation is a hallmark of Labor's policy in this area. The ALP is bought and paid for by the union movement. The ALP could never have negotiated the bilateral agreements that the coalition in government has done over the course of the last eight years and will continue to do in the next term in office.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and acknowledge her enthusiasm for seeing a vibrant Australian car industry. After people's houses, the biggest purchase in most Australians' lives is a motor car, and Australians have been buying an awful lot of them. Federal Chamber of Automotive Industry figures show that Australian vehicle sales reached an all-time record of 473,516 in the first half of this year. That is an increase of nearly six per cent on the previous record set only last year. Indeed, one manufacturer has for the first time ever in Australia sold more than 100,000 cars in a six-month period, in the last six months. The chamber estimates that for the full sales year this year it is likely that some 960,000 vehicles will be sold. All sectors are up, passenger cars by two per cent, sports utility vehicles by 14 per cent, light trucks by 16 per cent and heavy trucks by 20 per cent. These figures reflect the confidence of new car buyers, and the truck figures reflect the very strong economy and the health of the Australian transport sector.The industry reports an overall growth of some 15 per cent over the last four years in sales volumes, and industry are quite laudatory in saying that their outstanding figures are the result of very good economic management. They refer to industrial relations reforms and improved productivity and product quality. Of course, the industrial relations reforms effects, coupled with the other aspects of good economic management - good fiscal policy and so forth - have produced more jobs and better paying jobs. As the Prime Minister said, average income levels are up by 14 per cent. All of this has resulted in Australians being able to afford more motor cars and better motor cars. So our policies are indeed making cars more affordable.I thought it might be interesting to record the cost of vehicles under us compared with their cost when the Labor Party was in power. The standard Australian motor car might be seen as being a Commodore. When the Hawke government came to power in the early 1980s the price of a Commodore was $6,500. By the time they left office it was $26,700 - a rise of 300 per cent in 13 years. There was a 300 per cent rise in the price of the Australian family car, a Commodore, in the 13 years of Labor. In 8½ years under us it has risen by just 25 per cent. That is 300 per cent versus 25 per cent. Indeed, when they left office the price of a Commodore represented around 77 per cent of average full-time annual earnings. Under us that figure has come down to 67 per cent. A Toyota LandCruiser is a very popular vehicle in regional Australia. During the years that the Labor Party was in power, a LandCruiser increased in price by 200 per cent. In our 8½ years in government, the figure is just three per cent. That is 200 per cent versus three per cent. Our policies have made owning a car much more affordable. When you consider interest rates, under Keating, for small business in particular, interest rates were running at 20 per cent plus. Today they are 10 per cent or, if you do it on your housing mortgage, a lot less. In addition to that, the motorist ought to remember that when Labor came to power in 1983 fuel excise was just 7c a litre but when they left office it had increased by 500 per cent to 35c a litre. In the last few years it has risen by just 4c. It has been frozen because we abolished indexation some four years ago. The message is very clear: home owners cannot afford a Labor government and Australia's motorists cannot either.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question, and I congratulate him on the way he is representing the people of Dobell. As the member for Dobell well knows, and as all members on this side of the House well know, the Howard government's brand new safety net is the biggest single structural improvement to our Medicare system in the 20 years that it has been operating. Thanks to the Howard government's safety net more than half a million Australians are now enjoying higher Medicare rebates. Half a million Australians who are older and sicker, who are facing higher costs, are enjoying higher Medicare rebates thanks to the Howard government. That is more than 3,000 people per electorate who are enjoying higher Medicare rebates thanks to the Howard government's safety net - a safety net which members opposite want to take away from them. These are real people with real problems who are receiving real benefits thanks to the government.For instance, there is a patient with lung cancer. This patient has received an additional $1,080 thanks to the Howard government's safety net. Members opposite like to parade their compassion credentials. I ask the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Lalor: what is compassionate about taking $1,000 from someone with lung cancer? There is an elderly woman suffering from incontinence. She is receiving an additional $415 thanks to the Howard government's safety net. What is compassionate about the Labor Party wanting to take $400 from an old woman suffering health problems? An elderly man with septic ulcers has received an additional $240 thanks to the Howard government's safety net. That man will lose $240 if members opposite get into government. Let it be very clear to the people of Australia that the only political party in this country which is proposing to actually cut any health program is the Australian Labor Party. They are the only ones in this country who are proposing to cut a health program. It was not always that way. I have here the words of the member for Werriwa when he was just the plain old member for Werriwa in this parliament in 1994 - `once was Werriwa'. He said:... egalitarian values should always be reflected in the maintenance of a compassionate and effective safety net ...That is precisely what the Howard government has done. That is precisely what the member for Werriwa has forgotten. These days, he has changed. These days, he is inspired by Whitlam, he is advised by Keating, but I have got to say that I think secretly he was cloned by Doc Evatt. If Ben Chifley and John Curtin were around today, they would be supporting the John Howard Liberal Party, not the Mark Latham Labor Party.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition asks me about fairness in education funding. There is fairness in education funding - 68 per cent of Australian schoolchildren attend government schools and 76 per cent of all federal government funding goes to government schools. This is about aggregate government funding - that is, federal and state - and bear in mind that 44.5 per cent of all state revenue for their responsibilities comes from the goods and services tax or from Commonwealth payments to the states. So every time a state spends a dollar on a state school, over 40 per cent of that - close to 44 per cent of that - has come from the Commonwealth government. This is something which is conveniently left out of every analysis. I know the teacher unions of this country hate state aid. - I note incidentally that we are yet to hear a denunciation from the member for Jagajaga of the challenge by the New South Wales Teachers Federation -  - I repeat that the New South Wales Teachers Federation has planned a challenge to the 1981 High Court ruling that there is no constitutional barrier to federal government funding of religious schools. - The executive director of Catholic education in Victoria has said that the state's 485 Catholic schools would be devastated if this legal action were successful. Why therefore doesn't the member for Jagajaga denounce the Teachers Federation, or doesn't she care whether the Catholic education system in Victoria is devastated?The reality is that the Labor Party have failed to provide certainty to those parents who contribute over $4 billion to the education of their children in the non-government sector. When will the Labor Party get it into their collective heads that every time a parent in this country decides to send a child to an independent school - be it a Catholic school, a school like the King's School or a school like Bethel Christian School - they save the Australian taxpayer, on average, $3,000 per child per year. There is no justice -  - No, no, no, I have not. I warm to the task every time the member for Brand makes a point of order - because he tried to run this envy argument three years ago and he fell on his face. You fell on your face in the western suburbs of Sydney, because the reality is that the folk out there on the periphery of the cities of Australia want to have the choice of sending their children to independent schools. There is only one party in Australia that is threatening choice, and that is the Australian Labor Party. The parents in those aspirational suburbs know that their choice and their educational aspirations are guaranteed by the coalition. They know that their choice and their educational aspirations are threatened by Labor because Labor is still driven by a union ideology which, when stripped of all the rhetoric, has a deep prejudice against independent schools. Labor has a deep aversion to parental choice, and it has a deep hostility to the aspirations of parents who want to exercise a right of choice. This government stand for a dual system of education. We stand for a strong government sector. We stand for a government sector that continues to be preferentially financed. We stand for a government sector that says the 68 per cent of the children of this country that go to government schools should get 76 per cent of all government funding. But we also stand for a system that says that, if you exercise the right to send your child to an independent school and you are a taxpayer of this country, you are entitled to some support from the government in the exercise of that choice. That level of support will vary according to the need of the school. I simply say to the Labor Party: give us your hit list. Name the schools that you are going to take money from. Let us have a look at the list, and let us stack it up and see how fair it is. Then the parents of Australia will have further proof that, when it comes to choice in education, their real friends are the Liberal and National parties.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for giving me an opportunity to given an update about some of the developments that have occurred in relation to this matter in the last 24 hours. Let me first affirm that the vast majority of Australians agree that marriage is the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life. For this reason, and to remove any concern, the government is determined that amendments shall be passed which will enshrine this definition in legislation.I am aware of multiple commitments that seem to have been emerging from the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party seeks to assure the Australian public that its policy is one and the same with the government's policy - that is, to protect the sanctity of marriage. I will not repeat again the statement made to the National Marriage Forum by the shadow minister, save to say that one would have thought that it was an unambiguous and clear position. But a day is a long time in the Australian Labor Party, and when the pressure is on out come the weasel words and the backdoor deals. From today's media reports, it is clear that the Labor Party has been promising one thing to one audience while leaving the door open to review policy after an election. According to the Australian today, in the face of the backlash - as we are told it is - from the Left, the opposition leader has promised a review of gay relations. The article in the Australian says:... Labor will examine 'options to achieve more consistent national treatment of all de facto relationships'.Labor Left MPs said the amendment moved by the Labor leader 'opened the door' for gay unions to be registered officially if Labor won government.What we have is a new commitment - one that I think is ill conceived - wheeled out on the run to deal with the heat of this argument in caucus. The leader obviously has little knowledge of the nature of our Constitution and where powers are contained in relation to these matters. The one question the leader ought to have asked is where he would get the power to set up such a national register. Where would the power come from? It certainly would not come from the marriage power, because what we are saying is that the marriage power relates to unions between a man and a woman. It could not come from the matters that have been referred to the Commonwealth by the states - and there have been some matters referred to the Commonwealth by the states. The Commonwealth has received powers to deal with issues relating to the regulation of de facto relationships - that is, where there are children of a de facto relationship or property in relation to a de facto relationship - but that certainly does not go to giving the Commonwealth powers to establish a national register.All I can assume is that there must have been something in the statement issued yesterday by Mr Rodney Croome, when he said that Nicola Roxon broke Labor's promise not to vote on the Howard government's marriage bill before the Senate inquiry had reported and he called for stronger commitments to reform in other areas. That seems to be the genesis of this. It is an ill-conceived, ill thought out proposal - where there is no power. It certainly indicates what the Labor Party has been about to date, and that is deliberately delaying this matter so that it would not be dealt with by the Senate in a timely way.</DOC>

 - I will tell you what is fair about the government's funding system. Firstly, it is generically fair for the reasons that I outlined in the earlier answer -  - Mr Speaker, I repeat: it is generically fair because 68 per cent of children in government schools receive 76 per cent of all government funding. It is also generically fair because every time parents choose to send a child to the non-government sector, they save the taxpayers of this country, on average, $3,000 a head. Specifically, it is fair in relation to the Bethel Christian School and the King's School because the aggregate of government funding to Bethel is 61 per cent of the cost of educating a child in a public school, whereas the funding for the King's School is half of that, 31 per cent of the cost of educating a child in a government school - thus fulfilling the principle that I enunciated that, no matter what the independent school is, if you choose to send your child out of the state system, thereby relieving the taxpayers of Australia of the full cost of educating your child in a government school, as a matter of ordinary equity, you are entitled to some help from the government on a graduated scale according to need. And when you compare King's and Bethel, that principle is met. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - The answer is no. But let me point out to the Leader of the Opposition that what we have always recognised is that, unless the Labor Party votes for the free trade agreement legislation in the Senate, the legislation will be defeated. We have known from the very beginning. I know there are a lot of people who sit behind him who would like that to be the outcome; I know that and he knows that. What I say to him is that there is nothing in the free trade agreement as negotiated by the government that would in any way undermine the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. You do not need Labor's amendment to protect the PBS. The PBS is already fully protected. The PBS has been strengthened by the government. No Prime Minister of this country in his or her right mind would seek to undermine the PBS. It is a total and an elaborate political smokescreen in order to hide the fact that there remain divisions in the Australian Labor Party on the free trade agreement. He says that I am being untruthful by suggesting that there is some kind of theoretical conflict. It is not theoretical when drawing attention to articles 17-11-17 and 17-11-18 of the free trade agreement, which I did shortly before question time. One of them speaks of the imposition on unreasonable deterrents on patent holders from protecting their intellect property and one imposes an obligation on the contracting parties - that is both Australia and the United States - to respect the rebuttable presumption that a patent has been validly granted. They are the provisions of the free trade agreement. What I have done in good faith, having got the opposition amendment, is to point out to them ways in which those amendments might be altered so as not to undermine the thrust of the amendments but merely to reduce the possibility that there may be some conflict with the free trade agreement - knowing at the end of the day that, unless the Labor Party were to agree, the free trade legislation would not go through.I am not embarrassed to acknowledge the reality that the Labor Party has the numbers in the Senate to defeat this legislation; I am aware of that. But what I have striven to do from the very beginning is to get a free trade agreement that is good for Australia. What I have endeavoured to do - and I have achieved it - is to get a free trade agreement that protects the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. If the ultimate price of getting the free trade agreement, albeit with some risk in relation to ultimate acceptance for the reasons that I have outlined, is to accept a clumsy, unnecessary and undesirable Labor amendment, I will do so in the national interest, not in my own political interest. That is the difference between what I have done in relation to this and what the Leader of the Opposition has done.From the very beginning the Leader of the Opposition has played an opportunistic political game. From the very beginning I have sought - and I have achieved it to the best that I can - a historic understanding with the most powerful economy in the world that will be to the enormous longterm future benefit of this country. Every Australian knows that there is only one side of politics that could have negotiated a free trade agree-ment with the United States and protect the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and that is the government that I am proud to lead.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. Of course, the member for Hinkler is a supporter of the free trade agreement with the United States because he recognises that it is in the national interest and that the government, in negotiating this agreement, has defended the national interest in Australia in terms of those very important public policy areas that have been the subject of much debate recently. He also recognises its importance to the horticultural industries in his electorate in terms of exporting into the largest and most dynamic market in the world. This free trade agreement with the United States is the largest bilateral free trade agreement ever negotiated by Australia and should be endorsed by this parliament this week. The US FTA will lead to the creation of 30,000 jobs and deliver a $6 billion benefit to the bottom line in Australia. It will link Australia's economy to the largest and most dynamic economy in the world. A once in a generation opportunity has been seized by the coalition government, and we have delivered for the Australian people - and that is beyond doubt.Our government have now negotiated free trade agreements with Singapore, Thailand and the United States. All these agreements - I repeat: all these agreements - are in the national interest and will significantly contribute to economic growth and job creation in Australia in the future. It should be clearly noted that the Australian Labor Party have never negotiated a bilateral free trade agreement. They have never negotiated one. They sit there and criticise the government in terms of our negotiating strategies and the outcomes, but they have never achieved a negotiated outcome in their terms in office. They have no experience when it comes to dealing with significant economic issues, and their reckless behaviour on the US FTA is a case in point.A very important point that the Prime Minister has been making is that when bilateral agreements are negotiated both parties agree that they will not change their domestic law in a way that impacts upon the agreement being negotiated - a very important point to understand when negotiating international treaties. By insisting on legislation that is unnecessary, the Labor Party have left the door open for the US to challenge the amendment. By refusing to listen to the government's reasonable suggestions to ameliorate that impact, we are now faced with the possibility that the US might not exchange letters to bring the agreement into force. We know that there are many on the Labor Party side that would like that outcome. They do not want that benefit; they do not want 30,000 new jobs in the Australian economy. If this happens, it will be on the head of the Leader of the Opposition. He has used this smokescreen to cover up the divisions within his political party and his support base in the union movement.We have come to the point in this country where we are making a decision about 30,000 new jobs in the future in Australia and a $6 billion benefit to our economy. Let us just hope that the amendments that have been moved by the Australian Labor Party - providing that smokescreen - do not cost those 30,000 jobs.</DOC>

 - The answer to the last part of the question is no. The answer to the rest of the question is that I have outlined - both in answer to the first question from the Leader of the Opposition and at a news conference shortly before question time - those two provisions. There was nothing `spiritual' about that outline. It was entirely factual and it made the obvious point that it is a longstanding principle of international law that, if you alter the provisions of your domestic law after a treaty has been signed and that has the effect in some way of frustrating the impact of the treaty, then that treaty is called into question.The Leader of the Opposition knows, or he ought to know, that the government received in-confidence legal advice - and he will acknowledge, surely, that the thrust of that advice was briefed to him in the discussions that he had with government officials - and it does not serve Australia's interests for written advice to government regarding the impact of particular amendments to be made public, because if -  - The member for Hotham, in his usual fashion, interjects and says, `Oh yeah'. Let me explain seriously why that is not in Australia's interests. Supposing there is a dispute in the future and an American drug company seeks to use legal advice given to the government to support its own case. That basically is why I am not going to make that particular material public, but what I have made public is the amendment, the second amendment, that we asked the Labor Party to accept. They have said they are not going to accept that amendment, and I acknowledge that they have the numbers to determine this and therefore, reluctantly, for the reasons I have outlined, we will accept the Labor amendment. And I feel no embarrassment about that at all, because in the long run it is better for Australia to have the legislation passed and to run whatever risk there is than to say no and to see the thing certainly fall over - and I am not going to do that.But what I have sought to do ever since we got the Labor Party amendment was to suggest ways in which that amendment could be changed to reduce the possibility of conflict with the two provisions of the free trade agreement to which I drew attention. That is all I have tried to do. I have tried to do that in good faith, because I think it is the right thing to do for Australia. It has got nothing to do with misleading the Australian public; it has got everything to do with minimising the possibility of difficulty.So I want this parliament and the Australian public to understand that if a difficulty does arise in the future it will be 100 per cent upon the heads of the Australian Labor Party. It will not be because we have not tried in good faith. The Leader of the Opposition can puff his chest out and ask all sorts of political questions, and I will be very happy to answer them. But I have tried all along, since getting the Labor amendment, to negotiate a change that would diminish the possibility, however remote it may be in some people's eyes, of these amendments being in conflict with the free trade agreement. I have tried to do that, but the opposition has said no. I recognise the reality that the government has to accept their amendment to get the legislation through.Let me finish by saying again: none of this is necessary on the merits of the issue, because there is nothing in the free trade agreement that has betrayed the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, there is nothing in the free trade agreement that gives an unreasonable advantage to drug companies, there is nothing in the free trade agreement that will prevent generics coming onto the market and there is nothing in the free trade agreement that will drive up the price of medicines. Those allegations are a political invention of the Leader of the Opposition. </DOC>

 - My attention has been drawn to those remarks made by Mrs Judith Wheeldon, the well-known and well-respected principal of Abbotsleigh girls school in Sydney. Can I say that she is right. I think she is absolutely right in what she said. I think there should have been, particularly over the last few years, more money made available to government schools. I am very happy to support Judith Wheeldon in making that remark. The truth of the matter is that one area of funding to government schools over the last few years has gone up at a very steady rate - that is, the money that has come from the federal government for government schools. In fact, last year the percentage increase in federal government funding for government schools was 5.5 per cent, whereas the funding increase from state governments was, let me put it bluntly, a lousy 2.1 per cent - less than half the rate of increase.If the Labor governments of Australia in the states had matched what we had done for government schools last year then the government schools of Australia would have had $668 million more from their state governments. That could have made an enormous difference to those many government schools that need more resources. The truth is that for decades in this country we have had an arrangement where something like 88 per cent of the cost of running government schools is borne by the states, with top-up funding of about 12 per cent from the federal government.Historically, by contrast, the bulk of the responsibility for funding independent schools and Catholic schools has been in the hands of the federal government. That has been the case whether you have had a Labor government under Bob Hawke or a Liberal government under me. It has been exactly the same principle. Therefore, this device whereby the critics of the federal government only focus on the overall amount of federal government direct funding to government schools versus overall direct funding to private schools is intellectually dishonest. The intellectual dishonesty of it is exposed by these figures that I have just read out. The fact is that we have been increasing our share of funding for government schools at a much faster rate than have the states, yet they have aided and abetted a dishonest campaign - including through many of the teachers in government schools - saying that in some way we in the federal government are favouring independent schools over government schools.Not only have we kept up our end of the bargain more generously than the states but on top of that we have provided funding arrangements to the states which have given them untold resources, and I am talking about the GST. I carry around with me what I call a `truth laminate'. What it does is speak of the benefits of the goods and services tax for all of the states, and what it shows is that 43 per cent of all the money that the states of Australia and the territories of Australia have available to spend on their various responsibilities comes from the GST and Commonwealth government payments. So not only have we given more money directly to state government schools at a faster rate than have the states but on top of that, through the GST, we have given them access to untied money that they have asked for for years and have finally got. Could I say that over the next five years the cumulative additional benefit that the states Australia will have as a result of the GST - this is over and above the old funding formula that we inherited from the Keating government - will be $8.954 billion. That is $8.95 billion more that they can spend on public schools and on public hospitals. I will go through the states: New South Wales, $1.144 billion; Victoria, $1.435 billion; Queensland, $3.188 billion; Western Australia, $1.166 billion; South Australia, $750 million; Tasmania, $449 million; the ACT, $249 million; and the Northern Territory - with a population of fewer than 200,000 - $573 million more.It may be of interest for members of the House to know that, when they hear a state premier bleating about Canberra not giving him enough money - just remember - in New South Wales almost 40 per cent comes from the federal sources I have mentioned, and Victoria is the same. In Queensland it is almost 45 per cent; in Western Australia, 45 per cent; and in South Australia, 47 per cent. In Tasmania, 60.4 per cent of all of the money that the Tasmanian government has available comes from the GST and from other federal government sources. So let me say, in final comment on what Judith Wheeldon had to say: she was sending a very strong signal that there is an interest in lifting state government funding for their own state government schools. We have lifted our funding for state government schools. We have been fair to state schools; it is about time the states, with all of their resources, start being fair to their own schools.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. The big policy difference is that the Labor Party has an ideological objection to freedom of parental choice. Let me back this up by reminding those opposite that the very device which has allowed the significant growth in parents choosing low-fee independent schools in recent years - namely, the government's new schools policy - was opposed by the Labor Party in 1996. It passed through this parliament only with the support of the government and Senator Harradine in the Senate. If it had not been for the Liberal and National parties and Senator Harradine, we would never have had hundreds of thousands of modest-income parents in this country exercising their right to choose the type of education they wanted for their children. This is the core of the argument. You will always have wealthy schools, whether you have state aid or not. But what you will not have, if you do not have state aid, is the opportunity for parents on modest incomes to choose an independent education. And that is what the Labor Party is against. That is the secret agenda.The member for Jagajaga has got a hit list. Let me warn the parents of independent school students around Australia that that hit list is the thin edge of the wedge. It is the beginning, if Labor wins, of a reorientation of education funding away from supporting parental choice. How else can you explain the deafening silence of the spokesman on education for the Labor Party in relation to the challenge against state aid by the teachers unions - that strikes fear into the hearts of every director of Catholic education around Australia?The real agenda, particularly of the member for Jagajaga, is to cripple parental choice when it comes to education. The great philosophical divide is that we are for affordable choice, because unless it is affordable it is no choice. It will always be possible for some people to send their children to certain private schools, but it will not be possible for parents on modest incomes to send their children to independent schools or Catholic schools which are charging fees of $2,500, $3,000, $4,500 or $5,000 a year. It has been the growth in schools in that fee area which has followed the introduction of the new schools policy that the Labor Party voted against. They can go back to the Hansard and remind themselves that it was Liberal and National parties and Brian Harradine - and all credit to him - that resulted in the introduction of the new schools policy. No amount of contortion from the Labor Party can absolve them from the fact that when it came to that great moment - are you for or against parental choice for average income earners in Australia? - the Labor Party delivered a deafening `no'.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question and again acknowledge the wonderful work he does for the people of Townsville. Today's labour force figures show that in the month of July another 21,600 jobs were created in Australia. Whilst most of those jobs were in the part-time sector, over the last year 236,000 new jobs have been created and 202,000 of them have been full-time jobs. That shows that job creation is continuing in the Australian economy. The participation rate edged up in the month of July, and with it the unemployment rate edged up slightly to 5.7 per cent. But I ask the House to take note of this: with an unemployment rate of 5.7 per cent it was the 11th consecutive month when unemployment has been below six per cent. That is the longest run since monthly records began in 1978. It is a milestone for Australia - the longest run of low unemployment since we began collecting monthly data. It is, of course, the longest run since the damage that was done to the Australian economy by the Whitlam government between 1972 and 1975. What alternative policies are there on the employment front? Labor has a policy to restore lawlessness to the building sites of Australia, reintroduce compulsory unionism, abolish secondary boycotts, abolish Australian workplace agreements, add on-costs for casual labour and make unfair dismissal laws more complicated. They have a proposal - wait for it - for a new payroll tax and a new 4c a litre tax on diesel used in the mining industry. When you put all these together, the Labor Party has a proposal for Australian labour markets which is going to throw people out of work. We might as well be honest about it: a vote for Labor means a vote for throwing people out of work in Australia. That is the upshot. What we need to do is get the Australian economy growing. We need to get flexible industrial relations, we need seasoned economic management, we need strong budgetary policy and we need more job opportunities for the young people of Australia.We had Joan Kirner here in the gallery visiting us a couple of days ago. After what happened to Victoria under Joan Kirner, would you put her in charge of the Australian economy? After what happened in South Australia under John Bannon, would you put him in charge of the Australian economy? After what happened in Western Australia under Brian Burke, would you put him in charge of the Australian economy? Why would you put the failed mayor of a failed council in charge of the Australian economy? In the fine tradition of Bannon, Kirner and Burke, Labor have found another one. They have pulled him out of the worst council in the whole of Australia, where he has a record of failure, and they say: `Take that! Put him in charge of the Australian economy.' With a vote for a Latham government, the next day every Australian would wake up with a Liverpool kiss. They would be suffering for many months and years thereafter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. I am advised that Catholic schools in Queensland received an increase over the last year of $63 million, which is a very significant increase in the federal government's allocation. I remind the member for Jagajaga that I announced a few months ago in Sydney a very significant increase in federal government funding for Catholic schools.Let me remind the member for Jagajaga, if you are getting into real policy divides and a little bit of history in relation to this, that the great breakthrough that occurred in relation to supporting Catholic schools in this country came from the Menzies led coalition government. That was the beginning of the great breakthrough and it will always be to the credit of my side of politics that we broke a century of discrimination in this area.The member for Jagajaga says, `Isn't this the great policy difference?' - in other words, funding of different independent schools. No. I would remind the opposition that the great philosophical difference between the two sides on this is that we genuinely believe in parental choice. We do not just believe in affordable parental choice. There will always be some parents, whether they get state aid or not, who can afford to send their children to certain schools. Our approach in relation to those schools is that every time an Australian parent relieves the taxpayer of an average of $3,000 a year by sending their child to an independent school they are entitled to get some help and some recognition. We will always support that principle. Then over and above that you give more assistance based on needs according to an accepted and recognised formula. I remind the House that under this government about 300 non-government schools which charge on average less than $2,000 in fees have been established. Let me repeat that: about 300 non-government schools which charge on average less than $2,000 in fees have been established by this government. You are not talking here about King's, Abbotsleigh or Riverview; you are talking here about schools for the battlers who want a bit of choice.If Labor's old new schools policy had been in existence, about 200 of those schools would not have been established. Two-thirds of those new low fee schools would not have been possible under the schools policy that the Labor Party operated, which basically said that if you wanted to open an independent school in an area already serviced by a government school or a Catholic school you were not allowed to do so. That was wrong, but the Labor Party maintained it for 13 years, and if they win the election they will go back to that policy because they are against freedom of choice. - The facts demonstrate it. You are talking here about 200 low fee schools. You are not talking about Scotch, Wesley, Riverview or any of these schools -  - We are talking about low fee schools for people who can gather together $2,000 or $3,000 a year. I have been to many of them and they are on the outskirts of the cities of this country. You are seeing every day people exercising choice - a golden commodity in our free society and something that we believe in, and we demonstrated our belief when we brought in the new schools policy. What did Labor do? Labor opposed it. They said it was helping the elite, helping the privileged. What, $2,000 a year in fees? I invite the member for Jagajaga to go and visit one of these schools. This is the real agenda of Labor on independent schools. The real agenda of Labor is to take freedom of choice away from the battlers. Let me say to the Labor Party: you ran this argument three years ago and you fell flat on your face and you are going to do the same thing again. All I can say to you is, `Keep doing it,' because you are way out of touch with the aspirations of the battlers of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question -  -  - and for the baaing of the animals on the other side. I thank the member for his interest. Obviously he is a very strong representative of the Darwin area as the member for Solomon and he has done a wonderful job in representing the interests of those people. - The member for Lingiari laughs. He wasted taxpayers' money on VIP flights to dog shows in Tennant Creek, I seem to recall. But, coming from the party that pays an outgoing governor $650,000, it is not surprising. - Let me make the point that yesterday Jose Ramos Horta, my counterpart and friend from East Timor, was here and we followed up a meeting that we had in Jakarta at the end of June with further talks about the Timor Sea negotiations. To put this into some perspective, at the time of East Timor's independence - to which this government contributed mightily - we negotiated the Timor Sea Treaty arrangements for the Joint Petroleum Development Area, which provided East Timor with 90 per cent of the revenue from the Joint Petroleum Development Area. That obviously has been of substantial benefit. Secondly, we negotiated an international unitisation agreement in relation to Greater Sunrise, and we signed off on that during last year. The third phase of this process is the phase that we are in now.During our discussions yesterday, building on the discussions at the end of June, Jose Ramos Horta and I agreed on a framework for concluding these negotiations. Whilst we both agreed that we would not conduct the negotiations in public and go through the details in public, I can say that the important thing to understand about the framework is that from Australia's point of view as a wealthy country the integrity of our legal system and our boundaries is a very important issue. Of course, it is an important issue for every country, including East Timor. For East Timor the really important issue above all is for a new, fledgling country to have secure sources of revenue. Both Jose Ramos Horta and I agree that from here on it is not going to be too difficult to reconcile the interests of our respective countries. I very much hope, as does the East Timor foreign minister, that we can conclude these negotiations by the end of the year. If we can then it is obviously going to be very good for East Timor, but it is also going to be very good for Darwin. The member for Solomon, I think it is fair to say, has been an aggressive supporter of the development of Darwin. He has done a wonderful job. I hope people in Darwin recognise and appreciate that.Are there any alternative views? On 22 July the Leader of the Opposition, knowing nothing about this issue at all, said in a radio interview that if Labor were elected he would restart or recommence the negotiations. In other words, there we were, going through a difficult negotiation and the Leader of the Opposition, knowing nothing about it, never having had a briefing on it, was just making stuff up as he went along - as he did on `troops out by Christmas' and as he has done on the free trade agreement with the United States. He just makes it up, day by day, as he goes along, trying to make some smart little political point. He knew nothing about it and came out and said that he would restart the negotiations. If it were true - if Labor were to win the election and they restarted the negotiations after the election - that would be a massive setback in the time frame for concluding these negotiations.It is not often that I thank the Labor Party. It is not often that I could ever be accused of doing that. But I do thank the member for Kingsford Smith, the member for Griffith and, I believe, others who have quietly gone to the Leader of the Opposition and explained to him his gaffe of 22 July. I am delighted to hear, through back channels, that the Labor Party's position -  -  - We look forward to hearing from the Leader of the Opposition what his position really is. Through back channels I am delighted to hear that the Leader of the Opposition's articulated policy of restarting the negotiations has been abandoned. I appreciate that. But the fact that the Leader of the Opposition made this loose comment is yet another illustration of what an erratic and unpredictable man he is - and of his crass recklessness. This is going to be a very big theme over the next few weeks. The cockiness of the opposition, I suspect, is not going to go down well with a public which is concerned about their erratic and unpredictable leader.</DOC>

 - Yes, I am aware of both those comments. I say, as I did yesterday, that I have absolutely no truck with any company that is found to have set out in an improper way to avoid its responsibilities. People who are suffering from asbestos related illness in this country deserve the sympathy of everybody, irrespective of their political views. Given that we do have a commission of inquiry in operation in New South Wales, I have taken the position that the right thing to do is to wait until that commission has reported. I think it is an entirely sensible and proper thing to do. I again remind the Leader of the Opposition that if he really wants some moral high ground it is to be found in Centenary House.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question and his strong advocacy for public, Catholic and independent education in Australia. The Prime Minister has set out today the government's very strongly held philosophical commitment to choice in education, both public and independent. There are a number of things that Australians know to be true. The first is: if they choose to send their child to any one of the 2,600 Catholic and independent schools throughout Australia they will have to pay fees and they will have to make sacrifices to send their children to those schools. They do so because they know that, if all of those schools closed down and the one million kids had to go back to the public education system, the taxpayer would have to pay another $4 billion a year to educate the same children; $4 billion a year is what the parents of the 1.1 million children in Catholic and independent schools throughout Australia are paying in fees to educate their children, having forgone a much larger public subsidy were they to be educated in one of Australia's excellent public state schools.I am asked about alternative policies. At a press conference on 26 March this year the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Jagajaga made some statements about Labor's approach to school funding. The member for Jagajaga was asked about the resourcing of a school, and she said:Well, as I was just mentioning, the number one issue is fees. There's a massive difference between the level of fees paid by parents at this school - the school they were at - compared to the fees paid at the King's school - which, as we know, has been demonised by the Labor Party. The reporter then asked the member for Jagajaga:Is it just a handful of schools such as King's and Trinity that will be affected?The reply is quite instructive. The member for Jagajaga said:It's more than a handful because once you go into Melbourne as well as Sydney, there's many ... there are a number of schools that are very wealthy. King's school, Trinity Grammar in Melbourne, of course, Geelong Grammar ... Scotch College, those sort of schools. They are very, very wealthy.The next day, 27 March this year, the Australian Financial Review reported this press conference. The Financial Review reported that the press release from Mr Latham, the Leader of the Opposition, had specifically mentioned a number of schools but that Labor had previously targeted a number of schools, one of which was listed as the Bunbury Cathedral Grammar School. We understand that Labor's approach is fees. In other words, the greater the sacrifice the parent makes the less public resourcing that will be delivered to those parents to support the education of those children. So I phoned the Bunbury Cathedral Grammar School. I thought: how much do they charge, if fees are the issue? The Bunbury Cathedral Grammar School charges $9,200 a year. Reasonably, we on this side of the House assume - as do the parents of Australian children - that if a school is charging more than $9,200 year a Latham Labor government will cut its funding. We have identified at least 127 schools, educating 123,000 Australian children, that would under those circumstances be cut. It is even more instructive that two days ago Steve Price, on radio 2UE in Sydney on the drive time program - Steve Price does very good interviews - in talking to the member for Jagajaga said:Let's get real about this. I mean, I've got two girls at a school where I pay about $10,000 each for them.Then the member for Jagajaga said:That's right, which is heck of a lot of money too. You choose to do it and Labor will certainly make sure that we provide a basic level of funding.What she did not say to Steve Price was: `Your children will have their funding cut by a Labor government.' It is very interesting if you go into Melbourne and you are armed with $9,200 and you are looking at the schools on the hit list and you go, for example, to the Mount Scopus Memorial College in the electorate of Chisholm. There are 1,300 children there. They are charging $15,000. They are going to be cut. I would like to see the member for Chisholm front up to the school and talk to the families. Gandel Besen House in east St Kilda is educating 255 children of Jewish families. Keep in mind that we have heard in this House and publicly that, come hell or high water, what the Labor Party is determined to do is cut the funding that goes to the King's School in Sydney, ignoring the fact that those kids are getting one-quarter of what they would get at a public school. The member for Melbourne Ports must be quite concerned, because the 255 Jewish children at Gandel Besen House Mount Scopus in east St Kilda are paying fees higher than those at the King's School in Sydney. The member for Melbourne Ports has left the chamber. He is obviously quite embarrassed about this, if not ashamed. The member for Melbourne Ports has been to the school and he has said that under Labor they will not be cut. This is a very interesting muddle that the Labor Party has got itself into. Somebody is misleading somebody. I would not use the word `lie'. The member for Jagajaga -  -  - and the Leader of the Opposition have been invited on a number of occasions to rule out the hit list, and they have not. How on earth can the Labor Party cut the funding to the King's School, which it so despises, and guarantee the funding to another school which charges higher fees? The reality here is that an attack on one child in one school is an attack on all of the children in all of the Catholic and independent schools throughout Australia. The Labor Party may not appreciate this. -  - As the Prime Minister said earlier, every time a parent in this country, having paid their federal and state taxes, chooses to send their child to a Catholic, Christian, Adventist, Islamic community, Aboriginal community, Lutheran or Anglican school, or any one of a number of independent schools throughout Australia, they make a commitment. They sit around their kitchen table, look at their budget and work out how much they are earning. Often a wife will take not just a first job but a second job. They make enormous sacrifices to send their children to any one of these schools.There are members opposite, whom I will not make more uncomfortable than they already are, who already know that within these schools are parents, unlike us here, who have taken on second mortgages and third or even fourth jobs; parents who do not have a holiday, who drive a 15-year old car and who make enormous sacrifices. If a Latham Labor government cuts the public funding to any one of these schools throughout the country and forces those children back into the public system, it will have to explain to those children and their families why they are hated so much and then explain to the taxpayer why he has to pay five times more to educate the same children. Labor on schools is a policy of punishment - punishment of sacrifice and idealism.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Rankin for his question and the opportunity to discuss proposals for workplace relations in Australia. - The reality is -  - that since Australian workplace agreements have been introduced by this government more than half a million such agreements have been entered into. Not only have we had some 500,000 of these agreements entered into, but on average workers in Australia under Australian workplace agreements are being paid 30 per cent more than those under other federal awards. So workers in Australia are voting with their feet to take up Australian workplace agreements.One must ask why the Australian Labor Party have it as part of their regressive policy for workplace relations to abolish Australian workplace agreements. Why are they saying to the workers of Australia who choose to take up workplace agreements and be paid up to 30 per cent more on average that they should not have the opportunity to do that? What we hear today from the Labor Party, both in relation to schools and in relation to the work force, is an authoritarian stance that says you should not have flexibility and choice - that you should not have choice in relation to the school you wish to send your children to and that you should not have choice in relation to the industrial relations system.  - It is no wonder that almost every business organisation in Australia - ranging from the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Australian Industry Group to the Australian Mines and Metals Association and myriad small business associations - has condemned the Labor Party's workplace relations policy and their attempt to abolish Australian workplace agreements. - Those business organisations have condemned the Australian Labor Party's workplace proposals because of one unifying principle. That one unifying principle is that those proposals will destroy jobs in Australia, will destroy opportunities for small business and will lead to a worse economic situation for this country. The range of workplace proposals - destroying the Australian workplace agreements, centralising the wage-fixing system by giving the Australian Industrial Relations Commission more power, increasing the right of unions to enter the work force, abolishing the secondary boycott provisions in the Trade Practices Act, and even going so far as saying that $3.8 billion worth of Commonwealth government agreements will be given to those businesses that employ unionists - are destructive and regressive for the Australian economy. No wonder business and other independent observers have condemned this policy. It will be bad for small business, it will be bad for workers and it will be bad for Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I can inform him that, under the recent AusLink proposal, the government announced $1.4 billion for land transport under the new AusLink national network for Victoria. Included in that $1.4 billion are a number of projects, but there is one in particular that is the largest project that the Commonwealth has committed itself to, and it is the Scoresby Freeway. I want to acknowledge the work that has been done on the Scoresby Freeway by the member for Deakin, the member for Dunkley, the member for Aston, the member for Casey and the member for La Trobe. Any assistance on the Scoresby Freeway that could be rendered by the member for Chisholm would be more than welcome.  - The Scoresby Freeway not only is a joint Commonwealth-state freeway, which the Labor Party before the last state election promised to build as a `free' way -  - but also represents a wonderful new transport link for the people of the outer east of Melbourne. - As I said earlier, we would welcome help on the Scoresby Freeway from the member for Chisholm - but there you go; she is not in the chamber any longer.Every now and then somebody on the Labor side of the parliament tells the truth about the Scoresby Freeway. I think it is well known now that I have a soft spot for the member for Batman. I have always felt sentimental about old lefties. Every now and then the member for Batman comes out and tells the truth. I just want to say in his defence that we really found offensive the personal attack that the member for Werriwa launched on the member for Batman and his brother, and we want to repudiate that kind of vicious crudity in its entirety.We have heard about a lot of breakfasts that have been happening out on the Scoresby Freeway. We had my breakfast, where I addressed the topic `What part of the word 'freeway' don't you understand?' We had the Labor members' breakfast, where they addressed the topic `Tolls are good - prove us wrong.' -  - You got it in one! The member for Batman has identified another breakfast that is occurring out there - it is the dog's breakfast. In the Melbourne Herald Sun on 20 July 2004, being told that the project had blown out from $1.8 billion to $2.3 billion, he said, `It seems the whole process is a dog's breakfast.' Asked how the freeway would affect the federal ALP electoral chances in the Scoresby corridor, Mr Ferguson said, `Federal Labor is hardly assisted by the Scoresby debacle, and it is unfair for voters to take it out on federal Labor.' Why would voters take a broken promise out on federal Labor?I have got an idea for federal Labor. If federal Labor all this time has been committed to the Scoresby Freeway, why doesn't it say so? All it takes is for the member for Werriwa to say, `Federal Labor will build the Scoresby Freeway. But, listen as we will for that quiet little voice, for that solemn commitment, he goes out to the eastern suburbs of Melbourne - which has signs all over it, and has had now for 20 years, saying `Reserved for the Scoresby Freeway' - and they say to him, `What's your position on the Scoresby Freeway?' and he says, `What freeway?' He cannot see it. Back in March on 3AW, he was asked by someone who rang in: Mark, the state government and the federal government have signed a memorandum of understanding in relation to the Scoresby Freeway that it will be built without a toll. If you were to become Prime Minister, will you make sure the state adheres to that and the road is built without a toll?Answer:That is a decision the state government has made in its own right. It is not one that I am seeking to interfere with.This is not a matter for the state government; this is a signed agreement. This is $421 million in the forward estimates. There are two parties to a contract and, if one of them walks away from the contract, the other party has the right to demand that it be performed.We want to hear one set of words out of federal Labor. We want to hear federal Labor say, `Federal Labor support the Scoresby Freeway.' And we want to hear that $421 million, which is in the federal budget for the Scoresby Freeway, will be spent on the Scoresby Freeway. What we do not want to hear until we hear those words are statements like, `It's unfair for voters to take it out on federal Labor.' It is absolutely fair for people to take it out on federal Labor. If federal Labor will not stand up for the people of the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, it is absolutely fair to hold them responsible. It is absolutely fair to hold responsible the member for Chisholm. It is absolutely fair to hold responsible the candidate in La Trobe. It is absolutely fair to hold responsible the putative member for McMillan, who has said nothing on this issue and is strangely silent. He will speak on anything, but say the word `Scoresby' and he is struck by a dumb silence.What we want to hear and what we have never heard are these words: `Labor is interested in the people of the eastern suburbs of Melbourne.' Because I tell you what: the members for Aston and Deakin and Dunkley and Flinders and Casey and our candidates in La Trobe and McMillan are interested in the people of the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, and they have every right to hold Labor accountable for a broken promise. Since we are going to have an MPI on the need to restore public trust, I expect it will be led off by the member for Werriwa telling us that he will restore public trust in promises that were made to the people of the eastern suburbs of Melbourne and that Labor will commit itself to the Scoresby Freeway.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and note her very real interest, particularly in some of the more dangerous sections of the Hume Highway and in AusLink, because it promises to relieve that problem. AusLink is a historic agreement in the sense that not only is it large but it represents a new and much more sophisticated way of defining the national transport corridors, which will certainly produce better benefits for the Australian economy. Over the next five years we will spend just a touch under $12 billion on road and rail. To put that into some perspective, in today's money the Snowy Mountains Scheme cost $6 billion. So it is roughly twice the expenditure in today's money of the Snowy Mountains Scheme.It has been very widely welcomed, particularly by the transport industry, because it is an integrated plan to address our present and future transport needs so that we can direct spending to the best possible outcomes. It is in many ways a very large increase over what has been committed in the past. In the case of Victoria, for example, it is a 118 per cent increase to the construction budget for the next five years. In the case of New South Wales, it is an increase in the order of 76 per cent. In the case of Queensland, it is some 61 per cent more. It will see a much more effective linking of the major capital cities across the nation both in terms of rail and also in terms of road.One important aspect of this that has been overlooked is that Senator Ian Campbell and I announced back in January that the Roads to Recovery program would continue - that was, if you like, a down payment on AusLink - and that with it we would boost spending on outer metropolitan, regional and remote roads by $270 million. What has been overlooked about that and forgotten - and I want to remind regional Australians of this, and there are a lot of their members and representatives in this place - is that Labor immediately made it plain that they would be diverting that $270 million elsewhere. We ought not to forget that. They have made it quite plain that the $270 million that we committed back in January will not be committed to roads. It will be diverted elsewhere.We would like to note something about Labor's transport policy, because it is a bit like their transport security policy in that it is about five lines of small print that mean nothing. When you download it, it is just a motherhood statement on top of a piece of paper. With the transport policy, they say they will have some sort of national council and that is about it. But voters of Australia are entitled to know where the cutbacks in road funding that we know are coming - because they have said they are - are coming from. Where are they going to come from? Are they going to come from the duplication of the Hume Highway or the Pacific Highway? Are they going to come perhaps from rail or are they going to come directly out of other regional programs? We are entitled to know. - Indeed. I will come to Scoresby in a moment. The Australian Labor Party have a tendency to say one thing one day and something else another. We often see this. They also have a tendency, as we have seen with the Marriage Act, to narrowcast to one group one message and narrowcast to another group another message.On Roads to Recovery, though, it should be noted that the member for Batman told the Australian Local Government Association's congress last month that he was committed to it. It is no longer a boondoggle. It is no longer trivial and unnecessary. He is committed to it. But it is interesting to note that in the very next breath he said that he had already agreed with the New South Wales government that if Labor came to power part of the money would be directed away to a bridge on a road that is not part of the national corridor system. So in the one breath he says he supports it and 30 seconds later the member for Batman goes out and says he is going to lift some of it at a ministerial whim. He cannot be believed on this stuff. I will give this undertaking on behalf of the government to local government across Australia: as long as I am minister and as long as this government is here every cent of the Roads to Recovery money will go direct to local government. It will not be diverted by his slippery mates in the states so that they can put it into their projects and it will not be directed at the whim of the minister of the day in the way that the member for Batman has already made evident he is going to do. I make this point: we will not spirit any of it away. It will go, including that strategic proportion, on a fair and equitable basis to local government across the nation - as we have always said it would.Let me come to Scoresby, where the Leader of the Opposition has displayed an extraordinary and very dangerous penchant for sitting on a barbed wire fence and where the member for Batman has displayed a little bit of regard for integrity - just a little - down in Melbourne, where he intimated that it really had been a complete mess, a dog's breakfast, and that the people who relied on the building of that freeway were being dudded. Very interestingly, I have it on good authority that he gave a slightly different message to the tourism and transport task force last week. He said that he believed - and, as I say, I have this on good authority; if it is wrong we would love to hear something concrete on transport policy from the member for Batman - that the Scoresby project should have been done like the WSO.What is the WSO? It is the Western Sydney Orbital. What is the WSO? It is a toll road. It is not a freeway. So now the policy is that we ought to tear up the agreement, just as the Bracks government has said we ought to do. They have shifted, you see. The message to everybody outside Melbourne is: `No, it shouldn't have been a freeway. The Bracks government is right. They ought to tear up the MOU.' They talk about integrity. The Leader of the Opposition talked a lot about it once. He stopped recently. It is a bit like family values. He has nowhere to go, because his original commitment to these things has been shown to be pretty superficial. But on this one I think it is time that we heard and had a restoration of confidence. We signed an MOU for a freeway. You have intimated it should have been honoured in Melbourne, but in Canberra last week you said it ought to be done the Bracks way as a tollway.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question and note his deep concern for the people hurt in this derailment in his electorate. He rang me very early yesterday morning and, I think, he rang the Prime Minister as well, to inform us. I do place on record his very real interest and concern. I take the opportunity as well to express my sympathy - and, I am sure, that of all members - to the passengers and crew injured in this incident. As members will know, at around 12 o'clock the evening before last some seven of the nine carriages of the City of Townsville derailed 70 kilometres north of Bundaberg. I am informed that 120 of the 164 passengers and crew were injured, five of them seriously, including the two drivers. I know that everyone here would wish them a speedy recovery.The Queensland government has requested the assistance of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the ATSB, in the investigation of this derailment. The ATSB is an operationally independent body within my department, the Department of Transport and Regional Services. It is Australia's prime agency for transport safety investigations. It dispatched a team of transport safety investigators to the site yesterday, and they returned early this morning. The ATSB will chair this investigation. It will be conducted under Queensland legislation according to the cooperative model that has been established by the Australian Transport Council.The ATSB will also work with an officer of the Queensland Rail safety regulator, a representative of the manufacturer, EDI Rail, and other technical experts. I am informed that the ATSB has witnessed the downloading of the train's black box. The train had a black box and that information has been downloaded and will be analysed over coming days. I take the opportunity to reassure Australians that we always seek to learn from such incidents and to apply the relevant lessons in the pursuit of the greatest possible safety for the travelling public. </DOC>

 - I congratulate the honourable member for Lilley on his maiden question as shadow Treasurer. I will take up the last part of his question. The implication is that the Labor Party believes that the government should have spent less when in fact the Labor Party's program during the election was to spend more. Oops! The most expensive election promise ever made in Australia was the Medicare Gold promise - the fool's gold promise. The Labor Party has apparently concluded that it lost the election because it had no economic credibility. With that we would agree, but, if it wants to generate economic credibility, it has to dispatch the policies that made it noncredible and it must begin with the fool's gold Medicare Gold policy.You cannot say, `We had no economic credibility; therefore, we will keep all of the policies that got us there.' These include - and who will forget it - the suggestion from the honourable member for Lilley himself that when families are eligible for another $600 per annum it is not real money. It looks like real money, it buys goods and services and it goes into bank accounts, but according to the member for Lilley it is not real money. As he develops the opposition's economic policy I ask him to recognise that real money is actual real money and it buys things.I come now to what the Reserve Bank governor said last night. He said that the surge in household borrowing had to slow and house prices stabilise or fall and that that is what has been happening over the past three quarters and it is entirely helpful. This is a point that I have been making now for 18 months to two years. The governor went on to say:It is important that this slowing be accepted by financial intermediaries - that is, that the banks themselves accept that the market is slowing. It is important that this be accepted by financial intermediaries as a fact of life even though it probably means the heady growth of profits from mortgage lending they have become accustomed to may not continue. There is a risk that, in attempting to resist the slowing in credit, financial intermediaries may be tempted to further lower lending standards.I completely agree with what the Reserve Bank governor said, which is that credit is slowing, the banks have to accept the fact that credit is slowing and it would be a wrong response from the banks, in order to try and bump up credit again, to reduce the conditions of their lending. With that I entirely agree. For the member for Lilley to suggest that the governor has done anything other than warn the banks not to try and gouge back what is in fact a positive development - which the government has been arguing for for a long period of time - would be to completely misrepresent that speech.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin and warmly congratulate him on his re-election. Last week the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the monthly labour force publication showing that unemployment for the month of October fell to 5.3 per cent - the lowest monthly unemployment ever recorded in Australia. The records for monthly unemployment began back in 1978 and, under those monthly figures, Australia has not recorded a lower unemployment rate than 5.3 per cent.Mr Speaker, if you go back to the quarterly figures, you can find a comparable unemployment rate back in 1977, which was some 27 years ago. When the government came to office unemployment stood at 8.2 per cent and under our old friend the member for Hotham, when he was the minister for employment, it peaked at 10.9 per cent. Today it is at 5.3 per cent. I think all members of the House, both government and opposition, would welcome the fall in unemployment to 27-year lows. I also indicate that over the course of the last year 243,000 new jobs have been created in Australia and 173,000 of those are full-time. The monthly labour force figures bounce around from month to month but the good thing about this is that for the 14th consecutive month unemployment in Australia has been below six per cent.If we want to keep unemployment low, we have to lock that in with good industrial relations reform. This should not be seen as some kind of end; this should be seen as a beginning for Australia. We ought to take the opportunity to pass the government's changes in relation to unfair dismissal. We ought to pass the government's changes to allow more flexibility and productivity in the labour market. We say to the opposition that if it wants to establish economic credibility after eight years, the best way to do it is by supporting this government's policies. That is the way the Labor Party will find economic credibility, and that is the way in which Australia's unemployment will be locked low and will continue to fall.</DOC>

 - This is the government that put in place the monetary policy arrangements which apply in Australia, and this is the government that appointed the Reserve Bank governor. We believe that it is important for the Reserve Bank to continue the excellent work that it has been doing over the last 8½ years, and the government will continue the excellent work that it has been doing. If one were worried about fiscal policy, the first thing one would do would be to support either a small deficit or a surplus budget. The second thing one would do, presumably, would be to retire debt rather than to run it up.In the last five budgets of the Australian Labor Party, there was not one balanced budget, and net debt increased by $80 billion. Under the nine budgets which this government has brought down, we have not borrowed in net terms, we have delivered seven surplus budgets, and we have now retired $73 billion of the Labor Party debt in net terms. When the Labor Party wants to engage in fiscal policy, it will begin seriously supporting this government's policies. We are now two years on from changes to the disability support pension - another test for the member for Lilley as to whether he can get the Labor Party to support those measures. We are the party that announced and fought for the financial sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which the Australian Labor Party said in this parliament it would support and, during the election campaign, walked away from - which is still its policy. If the Australian Labor Party wants to start engaging in credibility on fiscal policy or, indeed credibility on economic policy, I say: there is one test. The test is its ability to support coalition policy. Until that time, it will stand condemned, without the economic credibility which it has lacked over the last eight years. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question, and I must say that I am enormously relieved to know that he is keeping an eye on me. He is very interested in water, and I think a lot of people in Australia are. Per head of population, we use more water than anybody else in the OECD, and yet we are the driest inhabited continent on Earth with perhaps the most unreliable weather on Earth. While we have five per cent of the world's landmass, we have only one per cent of the world's water run-off in our river and water basins. So it is terribly important that, in partnership with the states and territories, scientists, environments, farmers and water users everywhere, we develop a proper strategy for using our water.We set out our commitment during the election campaign in Securing Australia's Water Future. That policy affirmed our commitment to the National Water Initiative. It is an outstandingly important and very good public policy, as is the establishment of the $2 billion Australian Water Fund. We have made good progress since the election. We have been very active on this. We have started work on implementing the National Water Commission. Ken Matthews, the former secretary of my department, has been appointed as the chief executive officer, and that has been very widely welcomed by stakeholders across the nation and I am very pleased about that. He has a personal background in irrigation, he is well known as a successful and skilled negotiator, and he has the trust and the goodwill of the many stakeholders in this very important area. He has been moving around the states and has picked up a lot of goodwill. In the end, we are dependent upon the chief ministers and the premiers to reaffirm their commitment to the National Water Initiative. I think it would be incomprehensible to all thinking Australians that they could stay away from such an important piece of public policy.The legislation to establish the National Water Commission as an independent statutory authority will be introduced into the parliament before the end of this week. The commission will have two key responsibilities. The first is to oversee and assess the implementation of the actions and outcomes of the NWI against the agreed goals of the NWI. That includes a nationally compatible system of property rights. The second responsibility is to advise on the financial assistance to be provided by the Commonwealth under the two programs of the Australian Water Fund - the $1.6 billion Water Smart Australia and the $200 million Raising National Water Standards. This is one of the great challenges - I do not think anyone disputes this - confronting the nation. Using our water wisely will be of astonishing importance to us, to future generations, and to the sustainability of our life systems and our ecosystems. I would like to think we can show the way, to the benefit not just of Australians but of other people around the world who will be able to draw on the expertise and the technical progress that we are rapidly developing. All we need is to pick up the goodwill and co-operation of the state premiers. The challenge is theirs.</DOC>

 - My recollection is that the Treasurer did not quite say what the Leader of the Opposition represents that he said. I simply say in reply to the Leader of the Opposition that all of the commitments we made were responsible. They are affordable on the basis of the advice we had. They will leave surpluses which are much greater than the surpluses that were announced in May of this year and they will leave behind by a country mile the surpluses that the Labor Party was unable to achieve when it was in government. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question. The IMF has recently conducted a scrutiny of all of its members - I think some 180-plus members, including Australia - and reported on their economic policy under what is called an article 4 consultation process. On concluding that consultation with Australia, on 27 October it released its assessment. Let me read to the House the assessment of the International Monetary Fund on Australia's economic performance:Executive Directors commended the authorities for Australia's strong performance, with six years of budget surpluses, falling public debt, low inflation, high and rising productivity, and a long period of uninterrupted growth that has underpinned a dynamic job market. They attributed this performance to the authorities' exemplary record of macroeconomic and financial management and implementation of structural reforms, carried out in a transparent economic policy formulation framework. Those are not the words of the government. Those are not the words of me or the Treasury. Those are the words of the IMF after its assessment of policy making in Australia. Having obtained a report like that which puts Australia at the forefront of the developed economies of the world it would be a mistake to sit back and to say, `There you go; there is the assessment. It is a strong assessment. We can give up the game.' The reason Australia got to where it is today is the policies that we have been pursuing of balanced budgets, reduction in debt, monetary policy agreements with the Reserve Bank, tax reform, productivity improvements and industrial relations changes. If we give up pursuing these challenges today we will not have the economic policy benefits of tomorrow. So it is important that we go on with economic policy.  The biggest challenge that we have got to confront in this country over the next 10, 20, 30 and 40 years is the ageing of the population. We have to make sure we get our pharmaceutical benefits scheme onto a sustainable basis and we have to lift productivity. There would be no one reform that would lift productivity more in this country than industrial relations reform. If we get industrial relations reform right, if we get that productivity boost in all of the factories and workplaces and shops of Australia, then we will boost our economic growth and that will go a major way to helping us deal with the ageing of the population. To the Australian Labor Party I say: give up this opposition to economic reform; get on board with the reforms which will set Australia up for the future; show that the Labor Party has changed and support this government's economic policy. </DOC>

 - We love questions about fiscal policy from the Australian Labor Party. Mr Speaker, you will have heard that sometimes there are questions asked in this place which are called dorothy dixers, because it is alleged that people know they are coming - although I am not sure that is absolutely true. There is another category, which is frequently asked by the opposition, and it is called `Kylies' - referring to Kylie Minogue's I Should Be So Lucky. Here is an Australian Labor Party which could not run a balanced budget, which in five deficits ran up $80 billion of accrued debt. Here is a government which has had seven surpluses, which has paid back $73 billion, and the Australian Labor Party says, `That is not enough. It's too soft. You have only paid back $73 billion of our $80 billion accrued deficits.' We now have the prospect, as I laid out in this year's budget, of adding to seven surpluses over the forward estimates another four surplus budgets. If that were to transpire, we would have a run of surpluses which would be greater than that of any other government in Australian history.In the election campaign, the Australian Labor Party came out with a policy not to spend less but to spend more. They still have those policies out there - Medicare Gold, pharmaceutical benefits. They are all out there. They have not gone away. The member for Lilley has not pulled them back. But he decides to attack this government on the basis of its fiscal record. You can compare the government's fiscal record to its predecessor or you can compare it to countries overseas. Which country overseas would the member for Lilley hold up as a country that is doing better on fiscal policy than Australia? It is not the United States; it is not the UK; it is not France; it is not Germany; it is not Japan. I suppose in his ferreting around he may find one somewhere, but it will not be a major industrialised economy. When the G20 meets in Berlin this weekend - as you sit around that table at the G20 - Australia will have the strongest fiscal position of any of those countries. If the Australian Labor Party wants to find newfound economic credibility by attacking this government on its fiscal policy, all we can say is `Bring on the Kylie Minogues', because we will be enjoying them over the next few years.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. It is great to have you back, Member for Makin. Let me stress that bulk-billing is not the be-all and end-all of Medicare, but it certainly is important. It should be widely available, particularly for pensioners and families. And bulk-billing rates are increasing significantly thanks to the policies of the Howard government.I can inform the House that, in the September quarter, the national GP bulk-billing rate increased to 71.8 per cent. That is a 5.3 per cent increase since December. The bulk-billing rate for people over 65 increased to 82.1 per cent - that is, more than eight out of 10 consultations for people over 65 are bulk-billed. That is an 8.1 per cent increase since December. I am sure that the new members for Bass and Braddon will be pleased to know that in Tasmania the bulk-billing rate has increased by 14.8 per cent since December. The new members for Kingston and Wakefield will be pleased to know that in South Australia the bulk-billing rating has increased by eight per cent since December. The new members for Bowman and Bonner will be pleased to know that in Queensland the bulk-billing rate has increased by 7.2 per cent since December.These are not flash-in-the-pan figures; this is the third successive quarter in which the nation's bulk-billing rates have increased. And copayments are going down as well, thanks to the MedicarePlus safety net which members opposite were so keen to oppose in the previous parliament. Australians trust Medicare and they can and do trust this government to make a good system even better.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question and I report to him and to the House that the Howard government's workplace relations reforms have provided outstanding benefits for Australian families. Since this government came to office in 1996, more than 1.4 million jobs have been created in addition to those that existed at that time in Australia. In fact, we now have record employment in Australia of  9.764 million people - that is, almost 10 million Australians are now in employment in this country. Indeed, over the last 12 months, we have seen the creation of almost a quarter of a million jobs, of which 173,000 were full-time jobs.We have also seen significant increases in wages. The most impressive wage growth has been achieved by workers on individual Australian workplace agreements. Workers on individual Australian workplace agreements earn, on average, 29 per cent more than employees on certified agreements and women on Australian workplace agreements earn, on average, 32 per cent more than those on certified agreements.We have an opportunity in this country to lock in low unemployment, not just for now but for generations to come. We can do that by further workplace relations reform, by passing the bills which the Labor Party has stood against in the Senate - in some cases, for many years - so that we can continue to grow the Australian economy for the benefit of Australian workers and their families.</DOC>

 - I think it is interesting that the ALP is now questioning us on the performance of Australia's waterfront; I really do. I think we had 49 investigations into the Australian waterfront between the end of the Second World War and our coming to government in 1996. We have seen such spectacular expenditure of public money as was involved in WIRA - the waterfront reform program that the previous government put in place - which resulted in no improvement whatsoever. Having been told by the ALP, at the behest of their union puppeteers, that you could not in the Australian context raise the productivity at Australia's major ports above 15 container movements an hour, on average, to achieve our target of 25 container movements per hour, we have today been over that figure for 13 - or is it 14? - consecutive quarters, and the number is still rising.I have been asked about exports. Not so long ago, I had the opportunity to talk to some Danish shippers. They told me they could not believe the improvement in performance on the Australian waterfront. They said that we, as exporters, ought to know what benefits it has brought to the nation in terms of their willingness to put their ships in here and the sorts of charges they impose on us. I do not think the ALP are in any position to lecture this government, which has successfully implemented waterfront reform in the face of the ALP's abysmal performance over many decades and their endless attempts to justify the inadequacies of the trade union movement's response to calls for reform.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question and for his commitment to standards in Australian education. As a result of this government's initiatives over the last nine years, we now know that one in 12 Australian children in year 3 cannot pass a basic year 3 reading benchmark. We know that in some parts of Australia one in five boys cannot pass it in year 5. In fact, in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and other cities, there are children who have spent five years in Australia's education system and cannot read a single word. The government's determination is to make sure that Australia's school education system is driven by standards. We see it as the No. 1 issue. Before the government hands over $33 billion of taxpayers' money for schooling over the next four years, it will require national consistency in teacher training standards, student commencement ages and leadership in schools.The government will also make sure that school reports are in plain language. Parents are sick and tired of getting school reports that are turgid, meaningless and written in politically correct jargon which is often computer-generated. One of the conditions of the government's school funding will be that school reports be written in plain language and that students be ranked from A to E so that parents will know whether their child is in the top 25 per cent of the class or the bottom 25 per cent of the class. A school's performance will be published at the local level so that parents know exactly how schools are performing.In addition, I have announced, on behalf of the government, that there will be a national inquiry into reading in Australian schools. We need to look at how reading is being taught to our children. I am quite concerned about the standard of teacher training in education in Australia. It is of great concern to me - as it should be to all members of the House - when a University of Queensland report finds that 50 per cent of early career teachers do not even know what a syllable is, and three-quarters of them cannot identify the sounds in words. It is time that intestinal fortitude was shown in Australian educational leadership. It will be shown by this government, and we are focused unashamedly on standards. </DOC>

 - I firstly want to congratulate the member for Solomon on his solid performance in being returned as the representative of the people of the northern part of the Northern Territory. In answer to his question, this government is very committed to the view that New Apprenticeships are very much equal in status to a university degree. We are keen to challenge this sense that they are second best. Under this government the number of new apprentices in training has grown from 141,000 in 1995 to around 400,000 today. Of course, since the coalition was elected in 1996 we have in fact seen a 223 per cent increase in the number of apprentices in the electorate of Solomon alone. In 1996 there were only 453 apprentices in training there; today there are 1,464 people in training in that electorate alone.This government is revolutionising vocational education and training through a $289 million investment over four years. We are going to establish 24 Australian technical colleges promoting pride and excellence in the teaching and acquiring of trade skills. The colleges will be based in a number of regions around Australia which have skills shortages, a strong industry base and a large youth population - areas such as the Hunter and in Dubbo, Bendigo, Geelong, Townsville, the Pilbara and Northern Tasmania, to name just a few. The honourable member for Solomon will be very pleased to know that an Australian technical college is also planned for Darwin.As identified by our Prime Minister, these colleges are amongst this government's highest priorities. They will provide tuition for up to 7,200 students in years 11 and 12. To keep our economy strong, each of these colleges is going to specialise in a particular trade but will offer at least four trades, including engineering, vehicle manufacture, construction, electrical and commercial cookery.</DOC>

 - One of the points the member for Hindmarsh, in asking that question, perhaps does not realise is that his own South Australian government increased TAFE fees by 50 per cent over the last couple of years, whereas this government - and Minister Nelson has been at the heart of this argument over the past couple of years - is determined to spend a record amount on vocational education and training - $2.1 billion. This includes $1.13 billion to the states and territories to support their own training systems - that is this year. And this morning of course we introduced legislation that guarantees that level of government funding, increasing it to $1.154 billion for 2005. This will provide certainty in the funding arrangements and delivery of training for the 2005 academic year.I have to say that on this side we are actually delighted and surprised that the Australian Labor Party have discovered vocational and technical education as an issue, because it is something that their arguments and question time approaches have been devoid of over a number of years. What we are determined to do is to continue our contribution to the cause, to provide the national leadership that is needed. The contribution to the states and territories has grown from $777.9 million in the years the Labor Party were last in power to well over $1 billion under this government. That is an increase of some 45 per cent.Our commitment is to restoring a sense of pride to young Australians who seek to go down the course of vocational skills. We want to make sure that they feel as proud of that particular outcome as they might feel about a university degree. It is about getting the practical skills that this strong economy needs more of. The economy is growing so strongly and performing so well it is demanding that more and more people are skilled and trained in the professions that the Labor Party turned their backs upon. I would have thought the so-called workers party would have been all for having a trained work force, but the sad reality is we have been repairing their mess over the last 8½ years. Our program for the next three years will further that particular task.</DOC>

 - I take the opportunity to thank the member for Forde for her question and to congratulate her on the great work she has done in her electorate. Since 1996, when she was elected, the unemployment rate in Forde has dropped by one-quarter and I think that is a testament not just to the great economy that this government has put in place but also to the hard work that the member for Forde has carried out over the last 8½ years. This government stands very proud of the fact that unemployment is at a 27-year low, now at 5.3 per cent. We are very proud of the fact that this government, since 1996, has put into work 1.4 million unemployed Australians; 1.4 million Australians who could not get a job under the Labor Party have now been employed under this government. This government has also introduced, and takes great credit for, the Work for the Dole program. That is something that has been opposed by the other side but that we are very much committed to. Since 1997 Work for the Dole activities have provided 315,000 work experience opportunities for eligible job seekers. It was the Howard government that created the Job Network, and it has provided considerable results. -  - Despite the interjections from the opposition, it stands as a matter of record that over 518,000 job placements for the unemployed were posted in the last financial year. In the days of the CES there were only 300 sites. Since this government came into being, that has grown to 2,800 sites - over nine times the number of sites that were made available by the Labor Party to those people who were desperately seeking work.Despite the low unemployment rates and our booming economy, this government realises and recognises that more is to be done. We have expressed on a number of occasions our concern about the increasing number of people on a disability support pension. This government remains committed during the rest of this term to helping those people who are able to work into work, whilst at the same time those people who are profoundly disabled - those people who are most in need - will be guaranteed the continued support of this government.I make the point today that this government stands very proud of its record in relation to the Job Network. We stand proud in relation to the support that we have provided to those people most in need on the disability support pension, but we say to those people who are able to work: look for a job and we will provide every assistance to you to find that job. We are determined to put more people back into work to keep the economy growing strongly so that we can keep interest rates low and provide for the next generation of Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. The Australian government is concerned to ensure that older Australians receive appropriate care in appropriate settings, whatever their care needs may be. For example, if they require hospital care, then a hospital place ought to be available to them. In order to facilitate the transition from a hospital stay to home, the Australian government has committed over $300 million in a number of programs, including the Pathways Home program and the innovative pool program, both of which fund a place to enable older Australians to convalesce and to assess the options available to them - for, of course, most older Australians want to and do return home after a hospital stay. A myth has arisen - a fallacy that has, regrettably, been perpetuated by the opposition - that older Australians are somehow inappropriately occupying hospital beds, thereby creating waiting lists. That myth has now been debunked well and truly. In a recent extensive study carried out by Professor Len Grey and others and published in the Medical Journal of Australia, the evidence shows that the proportion of people over the age of 65 who are occupying a hospital bed has remained the same since 1993, notwithstanding an 18 per cent increase in that age cohort. The Australian government is determined to ensure that appropriate care is available to older Australians. We have invested record levels of funding to ensure that services are available for their health and care needs, whether that be at home, in the community, in hospital or in residential aged care.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question. I regret to have to say to the House that every indication now is that Mrs Margaret Hassan has been murdered by some terrorist group in Iraq. Her family and the British and Irish governments have concluded that she is dead. The body found in Fallujah appears to have been Margaret's and the video of the execution of a Western woman appears, on all the available information, to have been genuine.This crime is a particularly shocking one because of Margaret Hassan's long commitment to helping the people of Iraq in an entirely political neutral fashion. She has worked in Iraq as an aid worker for more than 30 years and the last 12 as an employee of CARE Australia. Despite all of the hardships she endured over this period, she worked for the Iraqi people, for the poor and the children and the needy and the dispossessed of that country. She set a wonderful example of selfless commitment in a dangerous and very challenging environment and she rejected a number of offers to leave Iraq and to return to a safer environment. The fact that her murder has been mourned so feelingly around the world not only shows her personal commitment and devotion to assisting her fellow human beings but also reminds us very tragically of the wonderful work that aid workers do all around the world. I want to take this opportunity, prompted by very sad circumstances, to applaud the work of thousands of aid workers, including many thousands of young Australians, who undertake assistance and aid work overseas, often in very risky and very harsh circumstances. The inhumanity of Margaret Hassan's killers passes description. Such people are to be condemned without the slightest hesitation or qualification. This latest example of cruelty and brutality reminds us again that there can be only one answer to terrorism, and that is the completely uncompromising and unconditional one.One of the most heartening sights, if one can draw any heart or comfort from the events surrounding this outrage, was the sight of many Iraqis and obviously many people of moderate Islamic persuasion taking to the streets of Iraq with photographs of Margaret Hassan demonstrating for her release. That is a demonstration that the people who murdered her do not speak for the ordinary people of Iraq, they do not speak for the ordinary people of the Islamic world and they do not speak for decent people anywhere in the world. On behalf of the government and the House, I extend to her family and to her employers, CARE Australia, our very great sympathy and condolences at this tragic, outrageous, despicable and inhumane act.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for that question. I am very pleased to confirm to the House that formalities in relation to the agreement have now been completed. Notes have been exchanged and the United States-Australia free trade agreement will come into force as planned on 1 January 2005. This is a very significant development for Australia's long-term economic future. The benefits of this agreement are broad; they will grow as time goes by. For Australia it represents a once in a generation opportunity to link itself to the most powerful economy the world has ever seen. As the American economy inevitably grows over the years ahead Australia will share even more directly in the growth of that economy than would otherwise have been the case. It will provide unprecedented opportunities for Australia to integrate further with the United States. Independent economic analysis suggests that the free trade agreement with the United States will generate an annual $6 billion economic benefit after 10 years. Over the first 20 years, the aggregate GDP increase is expected to total almost $60 billion in today's dollars. The agreement will see the creation of over 30,000 jobs, and over 97 per cent of Australian exports to the United States will be duty free from 1 July 2005.This free trade agreement is the most important bilateral trade agreement this country has ever concluded. It represents the culmination of an enormous amount of work on both sides. In his absence - but, nonetheless, very genuinely - I record my thanks and the thanks of the entire government to Mark Vaile, the Minister for Trade, who has worked so very hard, and to all the people who negotiated on his behalf. It was not an easy task. All of these agreements involve a degree of give and take but, in the end, because of the immense goodwill that exists between our two nations and between the Bush administration and the Australian government it was possible to resolve difficulties. It really does represent a hugely significant day in the economic and trade history of this country and it will further underwrite the strength and resilience of and the opportunities and hope available to the Australian government, the Australian economy and the Australian people.</DOC>

 - My diary shows that I met with him and others on 4 June at the National Cutting Horse Association of Australia's 31st Futurity Show, at the Tamworth Showgrounds, and also on 21 September at the announcement of Tamworth's National Equine and Livestock Centre. I have no recollection of him reporting back on any meeting, but he certainly did not comment on any inducements, because none were made. None were made or offered - directly or indirectly. They should not have been, they were not, and they would not have been. That really is the substance of the issue.This matter has been the subject of an investigation by the Australian Federal Police. The AFP have not sought to interview Ms Armstrong, me or Senator Macdonald. I have to say - I make it very plain - that I believe I have nothing to answer for at all in this matter. I am not the sort of person who offers those sorts of inducements. I do not do it; I do not believe in it. I make the point that if there is something that I think is deeply regrettable in all of this it is that, given that there is a police investigation underway, the full, proper, decent and right thing to have done would have been to have allowed that process to be completed. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question. I congratulate her on a magnificent election and an inspiring maiden speech. The member for Greenway will tell you that if you go to the Metella Road Public School, in Sydney's west in her electorate, the P&amp;C there headed by David Clark has raised $31,000 to aircondition the classrooms in the school. But the New South Wales Department of Education is refusing to provide $60,000 to the parents so they can plug the airconditioners into the power grid to get the airconditioning working. The member for Dobell will tell you that as soon as you get outside of your car outside the Tuggerawong Primary School the first thing you can smell is the toilet block, which desperately needs upgrading. The parents have been working flat out with the New South Wales Department of Education, who will not go up there and fix it.Every member on this side if the House knows that right across Australia parents have had it up to here with constipated state education bureaucracies that are refusing to meet the priorities and needs of children and parents in Australian schools. In addition to the $1.1 billion that this government will provide over the next four years to state governments to support capital works in Australian state schools, this government will provide $700 million directly to Australian state schools. The principals, the school councils and the P&amp;Cs are the organisations which know what the priorities are at a local level.This government is determined to cut through the nonsense at the state education bureaucracy level. As far as the Labor Party is concerned, I see that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition told the Australian on 27 September this year in relation to this policy: `This policy is bureaucratic madness that places the onus on P&amp;C treasurers.' I say to the Labor Party - who are obviously very slow learners - have a talk to the truckie who is the treasurer of the Metella Road Public School and he will tell you, `If this is bureaucratic madness, bring it on.'</DOC>

 - Again, I thank the honourable member for his question. Yes, I was walking out of this place - I think it was probably during June on one of those 24 occasions when the House sat after this alleged bribery attempt was made, during which the member for New England, of course if he had been so concerned about these matters, could have raised them under parliamentary privilege - and on the way out he motioned me over and said, `I understand you might want to talk to me.' I said: `No. What? I don't know anything about it.' I have no understanding whatsoever as to why he thought I might want to talk to him about it. I still don't. I said to him: `No. If I want to talk to you at some point in the future, I'll get in contact.' </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fairfax for his question. I can report to him and to honourable members that October was a record month for the approval of individual Australian workplace agreements. In October, 24,810 AWAs were filed and 22,749 AWAs were approved - a record for a single month. Indeed, over the last three months there has been a record number of AWAs approved: some 51,980 over that period of time. That amounts to a total of 569,364 Australian workplace agreements which have been approved since their introduction in 1997. As I said yesterday to the House, workers on Australian workplace agreements earn on average 29 per cent more than those on certified agreements and, significantly, women are earning on average 32 per cent more than those on collective agreements.I recently attended the signing of the 500,000th Australian workplace agreement at the firm of MiniMovers in Brisbane. - I know that the Prime Minister visited MiniMovers recently. This is a great success story for the business and for the employees. Through the use of Australian workplace agreements, MiniMovers has been able to increase its productivity and, in doing that, it has put its workers under Australian workplace agreements on better terms and conditions. So it is a win for the firm and it is a win for those employees at MiniMovers in Queensland. AWAs are now part of the Australian economy. They have been part of the reason why more Australians are in work and are being paid more at the present time.I note that there was a very interesting article in the Age this morning, written by one Mr Rod Cameron. Mr Rod Cameron, of course, is well known to members opposite. I think it can be rightfully claimed that Mr Cameron has been the most successful pollster for the Australian Labor Party. I commend this article to all members of the House. Mr Cameron, amongst other things, said:The attack on AWAs - by the Australia Labor Party - was ... misguided.He described the Australian Labor Party's industrial relations policy as:...backward-looking and totally out of step with community and workforce trends.I commend this article to all members of the House, but particularly to those opposite and to the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I think it would be highly surprising if I did not discuss with Senator Macdonald strategies for winning back the seat of New England. I make the point that I respect entirely the right of the voters to determine who is the member for New England in the final analysis. It would be highly surprising, given that he was the campaign coordinator up there. It is the seat next door to me, and I would have loved to have had it back here, adding to the voice within the government for country Australia. But did I suggest to Senator Macdonald that we ought to try and find the member for New England a posting? Let me be absolutely frank: as I said during the campaign, I do not believe the member for New England would make a suitable diplomat overseas in the first place. In the second place, it would have been corrupt and wrong, and I would not have done it. </DOC>

 - I very much thank the member for Herbert for his question. I note that his margin has just gone up from 1.5 per cent to 6.2 per cent. If the opposition keeps carrying on like this, it will go up more at the next election. Let me inform the House that this government clearly understands that you cannot have a strong Medicare system unless it is complemented by a strong private health insurance system. Fifty-six per cent of all surgery now takes place in private hospitals, and every private hospital patient takes pressure off public hospital waiting lists.Thanks to the policies of this government, nearly nine million Australians now have the choice and the security that private health insurance provides, including one million Australians earning less than $20,000 a year. Back in 1996, private health insurance coverage was at about 30 per cent and falling. Now, thanks to this government, it is 43 per cent and stable. I can inform the House that in the September quarter 42,000 extra Australians were covered by private health insurance, including 17,000 people aged under 30. While private health insurance continues to expand thanks to the policies of this government, the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition is that the private health insurance rebate is the maddest piece of public policy ever to come through this parliament. It is attitudes like this which guarantee that nine million Australians will continue to know that you just cannot trust Labor with health policy.</DOC>

 - I share the honourable member for Riverina's concerns about calls by the Victorian Minister for Water, Mr Thwaites, that the federal government should drop the linkage between the Living Murray initiative and the National Water Initiative. That of course is a matter of very serious concern. The two are intrinsically linked. The states in fact put at risk the entire Living Murray initiative by their petulant withdrawal from the National Water Initiative during the election campaign.You simply cannot have a Living Murray initiative unless there is security to the water users to provide the water that is going to be required for this initiative. Indeed, you cannot give the environment the security of the water that is necessary to deliver the environmental outcomes. The Living Murray agreement itself in clause 6 of the preamble says:Implementation of this Agreement will be dependent upon agreement by the Parties to the National Water Initiative Intergovernmental Agreement.So the reality is clearly that the call by the states to drop this linkage is in clear breach of the Living Murray initiative, which was so enthusiastically received by all Australians, particularly those living in the Murray-Darling Basin. It is essential that these key environmental projects proceed. It is also essential that water users around Australia have the security of access that is so important to underpin investment and the security particularly of towns in rural and regional Australia.Now that the election is out of the way, I hope that the states will think again about their petulant withdrawal from the National Water Initiative. It is vital. It is one of the most historic agreements that our country has ever experienced. It is a rare example of cooperation between the federal and state governments to achieve worthwhile events for our nation, and now the states are walking away from it to the great peril of many rural and regional communities and, of course, also to the loss of the potential environmental benefits that it was going to deliver.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question. The co-contribution scheme introduced by the Howard government is simply the single most important element in securing the nation's retirement income into the future that has ever been introduced in this country. It means that low-paid Australians can add to their own superannuation by putting $1 in and getting $1.50 from the government to contribute. This is for low-income earners and contributions up to a $1,000. It is for incomes of up to $28,000, fading out through to $58,000. This is a very positive policy because it actually gives people an incentive to do something for themselves, which is a fundamental of Liberal/National governance.I am asked by the member for McPherson how this has been embraced by the community. I would like to inform the House today of the comments of the Chief Executive Officer of HESTA - an industry fund basically for nurses and health workers, which is obviously a predominately female industry - Anne-Marie Corboy. In reporting that her fund had reported a 550 per cent increase in voluntary contributions in the June quarter, she said that this was largely due to the Howard government's co-contribution - people putting in $1 and the government giving them $1.50.What does that mean in real terms? It means that a low-income earner, someone on $25,000 contributing $1 a day out of their own income, will get $1.50 co-contribution. This means that, at the end of a 30-year working life, that person will have more than an additional one year's annual salary - more than $27,600 for their retirement income so that they can have a better quality of life in retirement. Unionists such as Greg Combet and Bill Shorten are actually encouraging their members to use the co-contribution. As I said, the Chief Executive Officer of HESTA has reported how well it has been received by her members. In fact, Mr Swan, the now shadow Treasurer, had this to say in 1995:In addition, the government will match dollar for dollar contributions paid by employees into their superannuation accounts. ... What could be a more concrete example of our determination to encourage savings rather than consumption?In 1995 a co-contribution was seen by the now shadow Treasurer as the most positive thing you could do. So what did Labor do in the last election campaign? They said, `We're going to get rid of it. We're going to take it away. We're going to remove more than $3 billion from Australia's future savings and we're going to put it into failed policy initiatives to try and win government.' The only thing that failed was the Australian population's understanding of and commitment to the Labor Party. They understood that this side of the House is providing an incentive for Australians to stand up and make provision for themselves, and they warmly welcomed it. Tomorrow, the Labor Party will meet in their caucus for a day. I strongly suggest that they look at their policy, repudiate it and go back to what the now shadow Treasurer had to say in 1995. This is a positive policy for Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question and indeed agree with him that older Australians are entitled to choice in their health and care needs - how, when and where they receive it. The Australian government is committed to ensuring that older Australians do have more choice. A number of initiatives announced recently will give rise to greater choice, and I welcome the announcement about the private health insurance rebate of up to 35 per cent for people over the age of 65, and 40 per cent for people over the age of 70. I further welcome a recent announcement by the Prime Minister with regard to people living with dementia to provide them with more choices as to how and when they are cared for. Specifically, 2,000 new dementia-specific Extended Aged Care at Home packages have been announced at a cost of $127 million. I am also delighted that the Prime Minister has announced the government's intention to make dementia a national health priority.With regard to home care, the Australian government has allocated a further $148 million for respite care and financial support for carers so that older people needing care can remain at home with the support and love of their carers. These are the sorts of initiatives that are building on the government's strong record of providing choice in aged care. In home and community care, where the government provides about $790 million a year, over 750,000 Australians are now receiving home and community care. With regard to community aged care packages, when we came to office only about 4,000 CAC packages were available. Today, there are 30,000. Indeed, the member for Kooyong might recall that, when we came to office in 1996, there was not one community aged care package available in his electorate. Today there are about 600 or 618 packages in the electorate of Kooyong. That is the story across the country.In residential care, the government have committed record levels of funding - about $5 billion per year now - so that about 155,000 older Australians can receive quality care in a residential care setting of their choice. In addition to the $148 million that was announced during the election, funding for carers has increased fivefold since we came to government. Over $100 million is now allocated to the National Respite for Carers Program. The Labor Party's answer to this was an unsustainable, unworkable policy called Medicare Gold - an attempt to nationalise health for the over-75s. It is not a policy that would work. I am surprised that anyone would still put their name to it. Meanwhile, our government are getting on with the job of realising our vision for a world-class system of care that is high quality, affordable and accessible and that meets the needs, preferences and choices of older Australians. </DOC>

 - I thank my colleague the member for Dobell for his question on a matter that is of great concern to all honourable members in this House. Last year some 1,634 Australians were tragically killed on roads in Australia and over 10 times as many were seriously injured, devastating thousands of families throughout Australia. - The Australian transport ministers have agreed on a target for reducing road deaths by some 40 per cent between 2001 and 2010. We must meet or even beat this target. Unfortunately, in recent months the downward trend in road deaths has stalled. Reducing road trauma has to be a partnership. We need to continue to improve our roads and, most importantly, to enforce higher standards of driver education for young people. I am totally committed to reducing road deaths and road trauma on Australian roads. The Australian government's AusLink plan will be delivering the biggest -  - Mr Speaker, this is an issue that is of vital importance to all members on this side - I am not sure about the other side - and it is something that I care passionately about. The AusLink plan will be delivering a national land transport program throughout Australia - some $12.5 billion, which is the equivalent of two Snowy Mountains schemes. It is an important project. The Australian government will work together with the states, territories and local governments to provide safer roads. A total of $1.2 billion will be spent on local government roads through our very popular Roads to Recovery program.The Howard government's black spot program does save lives. We have provided an additional $90 million to extend this program for another two years - a program that was scrapped by the Labor Party. The Deputy Prime Minister and I are both passionately committed to improving the skills of young drivers. We want a trial driver education scheme up and running as soon as possible. We have achieved a great deal in road safety. We will continue to take all practicable steps to reduce road trauma, death and tragedy on Australian roads. </DOC>

 - As I said in this place yesterday, lectures on waterfront improvements from the opposition are intriguing at best, and hypocritical and pretty pathetic at worst, I would have to say. I repeat the figures again, because they are worthy of mention. The more we can get them up, the better. With 39 or 40 inquiries between 1945 and 1996 into waterfront productivity in this country, there was no progress whatsoever, particularly during those 13 years of Labor. There was a lot of money to their mates - remember Mr Wran and the other assorted consultants? - but no progress on waterfront reform.We have had 13 quarters now of performance in excess of the benchmark we set for a productivity improvement across our major ports. The ACCC has identified that, because we have a booming economy with rapidly rising imports and exports, emerging capacity constraints may be limiting the benefits that shippers will derive in the future from reforms. In those circumstances, the issue of capacity is something that the shippers should take up with the port managers - your mates in the states. How about you go and talk to them?</DOC>

 - I thank my colleague the member for Moncrieff for his question and for all of the support he gives to small business in his electorate. The Howard government have provided a very strong economic climate for small business to thrive in this country. We have provided a tremendous amount of assistance to small business, and we will build on that assistance in a number of ways.We will reduce the tax burden for small business by introducing the 25 per cent entrepreneurs' tax discount and enable 740,000 small businesses to have the option to lodge and pay their BAS on an annual basis. We will also reduce the red tape by establishing a $50 million regulation reduction incentive fund targeted at local government - that first level of government which is accessed by so many businesses when they are just starting up or they want to expand their businesses. We will also promote greater flexibility in the work force by reintroducing the unfair dismissal legislation and thereby giving small business the certainty to employ more people. We will also provide a greater deal of protection to small business by strengthening the Trade Practices Act and making it much easier for small business to collectively bargain with big business. This government has delivered so much for small business over the past 8½ years, and we will deliver even more in the future. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Broadly speaking, he has outlined the processes that apply when community groups want to apply for Regional Partnerships funding. However, I would make the point that this government, just like all political parties, does choose from time to time to make election commitments which are not necessarily -  -  - You do; you did. You made a lot of them, and they were subject to no guidelines. Even Independents make commitments during an election campaign. Mr Speaker, there is nothing unusual or improper about that. You made commitments during the election campaign and so did we. For reasons of convenience and probity, many of those will be channelled through the expertise of the Regional Partnerships program section maintained in my department. Mr Speaker, I make the point again. You made election commitments and every political party, I suspect, for decades has done so. There is nothing wrong or improper about that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mackellar for her question. Today, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the balance of payments for the September quarter of 2004. The current account deficit widened by $1.9 billion in the September quarter to $13.7 billion - around 6½ per cent of GDP. While import volumes only rose by 0.8 per cent, they are up 13½ per cent over the year. For the quarter, export volumes fell 3.2 per cent, but remain 4.7 per cent higher over the year. In particular, exports of rural goods fell 3.9 per cent, which was driven by lower exports of wool and sheepskins. In addition to that, non-rural goods fell four per cent for the quarter. As Australia emerged from drought, we had a very good wheat crop in the earlier part of 2004. Indications for 2004-05 are that the wheat crop will be lower than it was for 2004, which means we are coming off a higher base in relation to rural commodities. One of the things that is undoubtedly challenging Australia's exports at the moment is the level of the Australian dollar, which is currently about 10c higher than its post-float average over the last 20 years in US dollar terms. This was the subject of discussion at the G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in Berlin last weekend. The United States, with its own current account problems, has the US dollar falling against most currencies in the world, particularly the euro and the yen. While that will be advantageous for the United States, those other currencies which are appreciating against a falling US dollar will, as a consequence, find that their export competitiveness has been affected and that will make things harder for their exporters.I acknowledge that the level of the currency has made things harder for Australian exporters. In part, this is because of commodity prices but, largely, it is because of a falling US dollar which, as I said, is falling against the major currencies of the world. It would certainly be helpful if that adjustment on the US dollar were shared by a wider range of currencies than is currently the case at the moment. We expect that it will be a challenging year for exporters. As a consequence, net exports will detract from the national accounts, which are going to be released on Wednesday of this week. It is important that we make all efforts to keep our economy competitive so that Australia's exports can cope with those difficult trading positions.</DOC>

 - This particular program, as the two members who have been involved in it will know, had an extraordinary, long history. It had been subjected to quite rigorous examination over a long period of time. It is a very good program. I would be interested to know whether the Leader of the Opposition is going to go up there and tell people that it is not a good program and that it should not go ahead. The mayor has written, making it quite evident that he regarded an application as having been made. There is an enormous amount of information available on it. I am happy to table all of that information.The fact remains that it is a quality program that the government, as part of its election campaign, determined it would support, just as the Leader of the Opposition and his senior frontbench people wandered around the country giving clear indications of a very wide-ranging number of programs that they would support should the Australian people have chosen them for government. Just a few days ago the Leader of the Opposition said that one of the things he was going to do as soon as he got back here was to hold us to all of our election promises, so that we would commit ourselves to doing everything that we said we would do during the campaign. We intend doing precisely that.There is nothing illegitimate at all about us putting before the people an entire range of policy positions, from economic management - where you did not do very much - social policy and a whole range of issues on foreign affairs right through to the issues of how you might respond to good ideas that are thrown up by local communities. You found plenty of them, I would have to say. I could read out the list if you would like. I would like to know what sort of due process you thought they should go through, particularly the offer of $150 million to the New South Wales government to fix the Murwillumbah-Casino railway line - a state government responsibility; they closed it. The only independent assessment of what that might cost to fix was done by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The Leader of the Opposition offered his mate Mr Carr $150 million to do it. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated that $25 million was required and you were going to give Mr Carr $150 million. Where was the due diligence in that? A bit of a profit for your mate Bob Carr in New South Wales, presumably to fix up the transport mess he has in the Sydney basin. I reckon the commitments we made will stack up to a lot more scrutiny than those that you made, and we have every intention of honouring the commitments we made during the campaign. </DOC>

 - AusLink will revolutionise the way that this country faces its transport task, which is growing very rapidly. It will provide Australia with a long-term plan for our vital infrastructure in terms of transport needs. I have to say that without a better way of doing it in the future we will sell Australians short. Under this program we have allocated some $12.5 billion over the next five years. In today's money that is more than twice what was spent on the Snowy Mountains Scheme. As part of that process we will see in this country for the first time an open, transparent transport funding framework freed up of ad hoc and short-term decision making processes.The fact is that a rapidly growing economy is resulting in a very steep rise in the escalation of our transport task. At the rate that it is building, in the future our roads will not cope with the level of freight that is being put on them, so it is essential that our rail network is brought up to scratch. The leasing of the interstate track in New South Wales for a period of 60 years, the commitment to spend some $1.8 billion on it over the next five years and, in cooperation with the states to streamline and facilitate the access arrangements, the safety arrangements and the signalling arrangements across this creaking network will see a dramatic improvement over the next five years.So I make the point that we desperately need a nationally coordinated approach to our transport planning needs. We need adequate resources. For reasons of economic growth, amenity, convenience and better environmental outcomes, we need to ensure that it is done properly in the future. I believe that the community wants to see a greater emphasis on transport infrastructure and on infrastructure more generally, and I would suggest that the absence of a coherent transport plan from the opposition during the recent campaign would hardly have helped them electorally. It is about time they came forward with a decent, coherent explanation as to how they will develop our transport infrastructure for the future. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. The government is delighted that the Prime Minister is able to attend the historic ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand summit, which will take place tonight and tomorrow in Vientiane. Amongst other things, this summit will mark the 30th anniversary of Australia becoming an ASEAN dialogue partner. Indeed, I think I am right in saying that Australia was the first ASEAN dialogue partner.This summit is a key recognition not only of the importance of ASEAN to Australia but of the importance of Australia to ASEAN. We are optimistic that a key outcome of the summit will be the beginning of negotiations towards establishing something that I think is extremely desirable - that is, an ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand free trade area or free trade agreement. That would build, of course, on the strong commercial links that already exist between Australia and the ASEAN countries, on the free trade agreements we have negotiated with Thailand and Singapore and on the work we are doing with Malaysia.The summit is also an opportunity to reflect the depth and range of our ties with ASEAN, from counter-terrorism - Australia and ASEAN signed a joint declaration on counter-terrorism on 1 July, and we have counter-terrorism memoranda of understanding with a number of ASEAN countries - to the defence and security relationships that we have built up, in different forms with different countries in ASEAN; with all of them we have some measure of a defence and security relationship. We have excellent cooperation with ASEAN on drug trafficking and people-smuggling, to the extent that we have as good as stopped people-smuggling from being directed to Australia.Our people-to-people links have continued to grow, too - through students, for example. There are 75,000 students from ASEAN countries studying in Australia, and over 600,000 tourists from South-East Asia visited Australia in 2003.Finally, we make a strong aid commitment every year to a number of ASEAN countries - obviously, not to all of them. To those ASEAN countries that are eligible for the receipt of development assistance in 2004, we will be providing about $400 million worth of aid. This summit is an opportunity for heads of government, including our own, to draw together the threads of a very comprehensive and very successful relationship - one that has continued to build over many years. I think that both sides of the House have been committed to the relationship, but equally - and it is important to remember this - it needs to be a two-way relationship. I think that we as a country have in recent years demonstrated not just the importance of ASEAN to Australia but the importance of Australia to the ASEAN countries.</DOC>

 - The Labor Party had 13 years in government to sign the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation with ASEAN, and the Labor Party chose not to. The Labor Party then -  -  - I haven't finished yet. The Labor Party then had 8½ years in opposition to say it would sign the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. This is just another example of a wasted 8½ years, I assume; you did not think of it in those 8½ years.The traditional Australian position on the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation has nothing to do with the notion of pre-emption - absolutely nothing to do with it at all. It is a treaty based on a series of principles. Some of them are the principles of the United Nations Charter, and one of the principles of the United Nations Charter is the right to self-defence. It is nothing to do with the notion of pre-emption. Other principles that the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation is based on are, among other things, the so-called 10 principles of the Bandung Declaration of the 1950s. One of the components of the Bandung Declaration was that governments that signed up to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation would abstain from the use of arrangements of collective defence to serve the particular interests of any of the big powers.Bearing that in mind, successive Australian governments - not just this one - have interpreted that particular principle as one that would be inconsistent with the ANZUS alliance. That obviously has been one of the reasons historically why Australian governments have not signed the treaty. Another reason is that it is a treaty that contains a provision for noninterference in the internal affairs of other countries. Therefore, it raises questions about whether, if you signed the treaty and you meant to sign it in a genuine way - taking seriously the provisions of the treaty - you would not interfere in the affairs of another country; you would not, for example, criticise Burma, Myanmar, for human rights abuses.These are the traditional reasons why Australia has not signed the treaty. The government has not changed its position, on the basis of those explanations. The reasons that Gareth Evans, Paul Keating and Bob Hawke gave for not signing the treaty are the reasons we give today. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. But firstly, I take the opportunity to congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your election to the high office of Speaker of the House of Representatives - I was not here for the last two days of the previous sitting week. The answer to the member for Fadden's question is very simple: more and better jobs for Australians and Australian exporting industries. That is what the outcome of negotiating a free trade agreement with the 10 ASEAN countries will be. Of course, this has not just happened. It is the result of a lot of hard work by a number of people, particularly through the government's persistent trade diplomacy within the region. We started this process at a meeting of trade ministers in Singapore in 1999. -  - Who is that up on the back bench interjecting? -  - It is a senator. There is a stranger in the House! We started this process in 1999 in a meeting of trade ministers and we have been building on the strength of Australian trade diplomacy within the region. We add this to the architecture of a free trade agreement with Singapore, with Thailand and with the study that we are doing with Malaysia and China at the moment, and it sets us up with great opportunities in the coming years within the region.We are targeting in terms of strengthening and greater integration economically with the 10 ASEAN countries. Within those 10 countries there is a population of 545 million consumers and a GDP of around $700 billion. An FTA with the ASEAN countries will create jobs in Australia. It will help further expand Australia's exports to the region and, obviously, deepen our economic integration with the region. Regarding the economic relationship, there is already a $43 billion two-way trade relationship with the 10 ASEAN countries and a $46 billion two-way investment relationship. As I say, building upon the other bilateral negotiations that we have concluded in the region, this augurs well for improved exports within our neighbourhood in the east Asian region. An FTA between Australia, New Zealand and the ASEAN countries would complement our already profitable trade agenda in our pursuit of the multilateral outcomes of the Doha Round as well as our bilateral negotiations that have already been concluded, which have been adding their weight to the 1.4 million new jobs that have been created in the Australian economy since our government was originally elected in 1996.I go back to my starting point, for the information of the member for Fadden. This outcome had its genesis in that meeting in Singapore in 1999 where we moved on to negotiate and conclude a closer economic partnership agreement with the ASEAN countries and things have now culminated in this summit in Vientiane at which the Prime Minister is representing Australia. If the Labor Party had been in a position in government to do this, they would have. They were not and they did not.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can give you the figures. In 1996, foreign debt was 39 per cent of the Australian economy and today it is 50 per cent, so it has not doubled. He is wrong in relation to that. Do I believe that Australia would be well served if the current account deficit were lower? Yes. I have made that point on a number of occasions. It is about the same level that it was back in 1994, but there are important differences between now and 1994. The most important difference of course is that, back in 1994, the budget deficit was 2.8 per cent of GDP - that is, the Commonwealth was running down savings - whereas today the Commonwealth budget is in surplus; that is, the Commonwealth is adding to savings. Back in 1994, inflation was 3.9 per cent and, since I was asked about interest rates, back in 1994 the home mortgage variable interest rate was 10½ per cent.I thought I would refer to one of the speeches that was made back in 1994 on this question of foreign debt. It always pays to acquaint yourself with history. It was by a young member for Werriwa, who was speaking on the appropriation bills and was highly critical of the honourable member for O'Connor. There is no-one on this side of the House that would be critical of the member for O'Connor. -  - I do thank the honourable member for Lilley for his `Kylie'. On 17 November 1994 the member for Werriwa got up in this House during that episode and said:The honourable member for O'Connor ... has again displayed the opposition's confusion on economic policy and its occasional tendency towards xenophobia on issues such as the current account deficit and foreign debt. The truth is that the current account deficit is the equivalent of the capital ... inflow. Capital inflow into Australia is a huge vote of confidence by international investors in the strength of our economy.If that is the way the member for Werriwa saw it in 1994, today's figures must be an even huger vote of confidence. I asked earlier: would it be better if Australia's current account were lower? Yes. Would it be better if our exporters were more competitive? Yes. What is the key thing that is working against Australia's exporters at the moment? The exchange rate. You cannot have it both ways. I can remember the opposition coming into parliament, led by the member for Hotham, complaining when the Australian dollar was at 47c to the US dollar. Today it is at around 78c or 79c - that is double. That does affect your competitiveness and the competitiveness of Australia's exporters. That is why it is important that this economy be kept competitive. The day we hear about the Australian Labor Party supporting industrial relations reform to help Australia's exporters is the day that we will know the Australian Labor Party does intend to change its spots and does intend to support economic credibility in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question. This is the government that, as part of its Charter of Budget Honesty, required an Intergenerational Report to be prepared for the first time in 2002 and benchmarking of progress each five years thereafter. In addition to that, at the request of the Council of Australian Governments I asked the Productivity Commission to do its own projections in relation to the ageing of Australia's population. The draft report of the Productivity Commission largely endorses the Treasury forecasts and says that Australia's ageing of the population could open up a gap between revenue and outlays - state and federal - of the dimension of around seven per cent in 40 years time. This is because the work force age population in Australia is hardly going to change but the number of people of retirement age is going to double, or more than double, over the next 40 years. In particular, the costs in relation to medical care - not only because older people draw down more on medical care but because new drugs and new techniques are being invented - are going to put considerable pressure on the Commonwealth account.What is the government doing to address these challenges? We are taking measures to increase participation amongst the work force population. We are taking measures to increase productivity. We have announced an increase in the preservation age for superannuation to 60 and an increase in the age pension age for women to 65. We announced at the last election a mature age tax offset to encourage Australians aged 55 to remain in the work force. We have announced changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to base that scheme on a sustainable basis.There were a lot of opposition spokesmen and spokeswomen out on the weekend. One of them was the honourable member for Melbourne. He spoke quite a lot of sense on the weekend: he went out and warned of the Medicare Gold Labor Party policy, which would add a substantial burden to future federal budgets. He was right about that. There has probably never been a more irresponsible promise made. In the context of an ageing population and increasing health care, there was an offer, without private health insurance, of free first-class private health care to everybody over 75 - a cohort of people that we know is going to grow and grow over the next 40 years. There has probably never been a more expensive promise made.Where does the Australian Labor Party stand on Medicare Gold today? When I was a kid there used to be an ad that said, `Don't wait to be told; you need Palmolive Gold.' Don't wait to be told; ditch Medicare Gold. The member for Melbourne was out there belling the cat on the weekend. Medicare Gold is a promise which is irresponsible. It is a promise which no government in Australia in 40 years, let alone 30 years or 20 years, would possibly be able to honour.The Australian Labor Party have now conceded they lost the last election because they had no economic credibility. That is their own analysis. And the Australian Labor Party now say, `We are determined to become credible.' You will not be credible if you maintain the policies that led to the loss of credibility. It is more than signing bits of cardboard. Economic credibility comes from policy. Until such time as the Australian Labor Party change their policy on Medicare Gold, change their policy on industrial relations, change their policy on unfair dismissal and change their policy on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme - which they opposed and then they supported and now they oppose -  - That is what happened in the campaign with co-contributions - one wonders where it is up to now. In the confused menagerie that the Australian Labor Party today represents, the Leader of the Opposition calls his economic spokesmen `roosters'. The member for Lyons calls the member for Grayndler a `mangy dog'. The member for Brand has his chief of staff out describing the Leader of the Opposition as a `dead parrot'. Those of you that watch Monty Python, as I do, please go back and have a look at the video. On the weekend, a rooster declared a jihad on a dead parrot! My head was spinning! This is the animal farm that the Australian Labor Party now represents. Until it has the opportunity to get some policy, it will not have economic credibility. Credibility comes from policy. </DOC>

 - I have already answered this question. Firstly, comparing the current account deficit in 2004 to the current account deficit in 1994: as I have already indicated, in 1994, when the current account deficit was 6½ per cent of GDP, the budget was in deficit to 2.8 per cent - that is, the Commonwealth government was a borrower and a large reason for the run-down in savings. Now the Commonwealth government is a saver. The Commonwealth government is making no impact at all on foreign borrowings. Secondly, as I have already pointed out, the home mortgage variable interest rate was 10½ per cent compared to 7.05 per cent today. Interest rates were higher.I do want to make one other point. Back in 1994 Australia's foreign currency borrowing credit rate had been downgraded not once but twice. It was downgraded in 1986 at the time of `banana republic' and it was downgraded again in the late eighties. Since this government was elected, Australia's foreign currency borrowing credit rating has been revised upward not once but twice - that is, Australia now enjoys a AAA credit rating on foreign currency borrowings. What determines a premium on your borrowing is your credit rating. A credit rating allows a lender to trade off risk against margin. So, if your credit rating is down, the risk premium which a lender will want in turn to lend to you is higher. This is the government that recovered Australia's AAA credit rating in the international markets. That has made all the difference. That is one of reasons why mortgage interest rates today are 7.05 per cent rather than 10½ per cent, which they were in 1994-95.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the member for Pearce for her question. I appreciate the concern she shows about the situation in Ukraine. Just before question time today I met with the Ambassador of Ukraine and expressed yet again the Australian government's deep concern about the irregularities which clearly took place in the Ukrainian presidential elections on 21 November. It is clear from the reports of international observers that this election fell well short of international standards. There was a suspiciously high voter turnout in several regions. There was fraudulent use of absentee voting. State employees were pressured to vote for Mr Yanukovich, the Prime Minister. There was abuse of state resources and overt media bias. In these circumstances Australia cannot accept the official result. We cannot accept that this result reflects the will of the Ukrainian people. I note - and, as members of parliament, we should all note - that the Ukranian parliament has passed a resolution declaring the results invalid. The supreme court of the Ukraine will consider today whether the general election commission acted properly in declaring Mr Yanukovich the winner. I can only make one other comment, which is that I would be pretty sure I spoke on behalf of all members of this parliament if I said that we have been pleased to see the people of Ukraine express their will in a very peaceful way through demonstrations in Kiev and other parts of the country. We very much hope that the differences that exist in Ukraine can be resolved satisfactorily and, more than that, they can be resolved according to the good principles of democracy and free and fair elections.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Adelaide for her question. The short answer is: no, we are not going down the pathway that the Australian Labor Party had in place where they were taxing businesses in order to try and drive a training agenda. In fact, this government is instead going down the path of encouraging good partnerships with industry to take some of the responsibility, along with the state and territory governments, for the business of ensuring that more people are involved in taking up trade based apprenticeships around Australia. We have had quite a deal of success in this. We have seen enormous numbers of new apprenticeships developed over the last few years. Under the Australian Labor Party, the number of trade based apprenticeships plummeted from 160,990 in 1990 to 107,000 in 1994. Today there are 146,400 trade apprentices in training. We are driving an agenda that is undoing a lot of the mess of the previous government's neglect. Unfortunately, what we are finding -  - The member for Jagajaga is interrupting, but there has been a 250 per cent increase in the number of new apprenticeships in her own electorate. The other key point is that all around Australia today we have state governments driving up TAFE charges - charges up front. The up-front fees that are charged to new apprentices are going up all around the country. For instance, there has been a 50 per cent increase in South Australia and a 300 per cent increase in New South Wales. The Victorian government has driven them up as well. But the latest insult to injury has happened: the Bracks Labor government in Victoria now wants to charge apprentices $30 to receive their completion certificates. So here we have people who have put it all on the line, worked hard and gained an apprenticeship and, in order to get the piece of paper to say they have done the job, the Bracks government wants to charge them $30 for that certificate.I therefore welcome the member for Adelaide's question, because it does raise the question - it is another one of those the Treasurer would call a `Kylie', I suppose. It is time for the Leader of the Opposition to pick up the phone and ring Steve Bracks, the Premier of Victoria, and tell him to ease the squeeze on apprenticeships and to end the `Bracks whack'. But of course the Leader of the Opposition probably cannot pick up that phone and guarantee he will get put through, so maybe a certain Labor senator from Victoria, Senator Conroy, can do it for him. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. He will be aware that the Murray-Darling Basin has experienced the driest four years in recorded history, so the reserves of water in the basin are exceptionally low and it will not be possible to meet all of the commitments to irrigators and other users in the year ahead. Nonetheless, the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council is proceeding with plans to develop and implement the Living Murray initiative first step.Honourable members will be aware that six icon sites have been identified where 500 gigalitres of water will be used to help improve the environmental health of the river. Those sites and the engineering works associated with putting these projects together have been approved over recent months. At the meeting last Friday, ministers agreed on four packages of projects in New South Wales and Victoria to provide 240 gigalitres of the water intended for the first stage. That is a very significant step. It is about half the volume of Sydney Harbour to be available every year to improve the environmental health of the river, and it is around half of all the water that will be required for the first stage. So, well ahead of schedule, around half the water has already been identified for the Living Murray initiative, and there is about another 70 gigalitres available in projects under development to help make this ambitious plan a reality.What is also important - and I am sure the honourable member for Barker will be particularly pleased by this - is that none of these projects will require the commission to enter the marketplace or distort the market. This will all come from savings through the system: the cooperation of the various jurisdictions and users of water to help deliver savings to benefit the environment. This is a very significant environmental project for Australia. As soon as the jurisdictions recommit to the National Water Initiative it will be possible to roll out the environmental projects for these six icon ecological sites along the river and to help build a stronger and healthier river.Can I also mention that the meeting adopted salinity targets for the various river systems in the Murray-Darling Basin area, and it will release a salinity management strategy to help address this other key problem in the Murray-Darling Basin region.Finally, I am sure the honourable member, along with other members from South Australia, would be interested to know that the council has committed a further $7.5 million towards maintaining the sand pumping and dredging project at the River Murray mouth. When there is no water, it is simply not possible for it to be flushed out naturally, so this extensive pumping and dredging arrangement will need to continue. Adequate budget funds have been provided to make sure that the mouth of the river is kept as healthy as possible in these dry times.</DOC>

 - I think the member has really asked the wrong minister, in the sense that the ACCC is not within my remit, but I am happy to check it all out. What I am particularly conscious of - and, naturally enough, concerned about - is that the impact of the state governments' fee increases is driving up the cost to apprentices taking up new apprenticeships. - Mr Speaker, it is also about the area of traditional trades, of which bricklaying is just one. The point that the Labor Party need to understand very clearly is that, as a direct result of Labor government actions around various states of Australia, it has become harder for apprentices to afford the cost of a new apprenticeship. It is extremely important for the Labor Party to understand the culture of what their own governments at the state level have actually driven. We have done some work with Access Economics - and Access Economics, of course, is by no means strange to those opposite - and in fact we have had to revise downwards the projected increase in demand for vocational and technical education over the 2004-06 period from 2.9 per cent to 1.7 per cent in VET hours.That is a result of factoring in the increases in the costs of studying in order to get people such as bricklayers out into the workplace. I am happy to look into the specifics the member has asked for but at the end of it those opposite need to understand that there has been a cultural change in the work force today. Those opposite also need to understand that we are delighted to receive questions on vocational and technical education. I think we have had more in the last week and a half than we have had in the previous 8½ years.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question and I congratulate him on increasing his margin from six per cent to a very healthy 10.8 per cent -  -  - as many members opposite have done in the recent election. It is a fact that the most comprehensive major study of avoidable deaths in Australian health institutions suggested that 20 per cent of these were due to poor information or inadequate record keeping. So an integrated electronic health record should mean better care for patients and it should mean lower costs to taxpayers and to consumers. It should mean less need for patients to keep records and to carry information around with them. It should mean fewer expensive and invasive diagnostic tests. It should mean less overservicing and it should mean less misuse of prescription drugs. Just about all the computers on all the health professionals' desks right around our country are already linked via the Internet. The challenge is to try to create a secure database with secure transmissions so that patients and health professionals can access the information they need precisely when they need it. In the last budget, the government committed $128 million to prepare for a national HealthConnect roll-out. In Tasmania, they have just concluded a trial which has proven the technology and helped to demonstrate the business case. I can inform the member for Moore and the House that the Commonwealth and the states have just established a National E-Health Transition Authority with the task of trying to ensure that health records move out of the horse-and-buggy era. We have to ensure that our health record system, no less than our medical treatment, remains the very best in the world.</DOC>

 - I will take that question on housing costs and thank the honourable member very much for his question. It is true that, because unemployment is low in Australia, in some areas there are shortages of skilled labour. That can be looked at as a bad thing in an economy or it can be looked at as a very positive thing, frankly. If we had our choice between an oversupply of labour or a shortage of labour, we would probably take a shortage of labour because what that indicates is that people can find work.Australia was not actually suffering from any skills shortages or any shortages of labour during the Labor Party's term in government when we had 11 per cent unemployment. But, having said that, if you want to ensure that there are no bottlenecks in an economy it is important that you continue to supply skilled labour lest you get price pressures in those areas. That brings into play two issues. One is this government's immigration program, which has been refocused on skilled immigration very deliberately. It contrasts with the Australian Labor Party's program, which was focused on family reunion. Second is the program that this government announced to set up Australian technical colleges.We announced that because, as the Prime Minister said over and over again during the election campaign, we want a system where Australian young people and their parents value a trade certificate as much as a university degree. The idea which was developed for a good period during the 1980s and 1990s that every child should go to university was not serving our community well. It was not in their interests and it was not in the interests of the economy. This government is ensuring that there are additional technical and trade training areas. We are stepping in where there has been a failure by the states and we are ensuring that there will be a strong labour market. We will make sure that demand is still strong because demand in the housing market has been a big part of Australia's success story and its recent economic growth over the last eight years. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson for his question. I am pleased to inform the House that the ATO has informed me that they are about to roll out the first tranche of payments of the Howard government's co-contribution scheme. They have recently checked 1.25 million income tax returns for their eligibility for the co-contribution. Of that 1.25 million, I am pleased to inform the House that some 215,000 middle- and low-income earners will be receiving a co-contribution towards their retirement income.This is particularly good news because it is not only doing something positive today, but it is also giving an incentive to Australians to make provision for their retirement in years to come. The tax office estimates that $110 million will be injected into Australia's superannuation as a result of these payments, which is an average of about $510 per payment per person. To put this into the context, with this extra payment, a person on $28,000 over a 30-year working life will increase their retirement balance by about $54,000 or potentially about $2,300 extra income in retirement, which is a great thing for Australians to look forward to.This morning I noticed in the Australian Financial Review that one of Australia's largest industry funds, the Australian Retirement Fund, is planning a promotion in which one of its members describes the co-contribution as `bloody brilliant'. Quite frankly, I am sure the 215,000 Australians out there who are about to receive extra money through the Howard government's co-contribution would agree with the sentiment that this is `bloody brilliant'. It means that Australians are being provided an incentive to make provision for themselves and, in doing so, to have more secure superannuation.</DOC>

 - The member for Jagajaga has discovered the trades! The workers' party have discovered the trade skills that underpin Australia's economy! What is true is that in 1995 an estimated 89,300 individuals applied for but were unable to get a place to study in a vocational education training course. Of those, 69,400 were seeking access to a TAFE place. In 1999 the level was 71,100 - it had fallen - and 53,900 were seeking a TAFE place. In 2003 the level had fallen to 55,400, of whom 45,900 were seeking a TAFE place.In the face of state governments lifting TAFE fees, in the face of a decade or more of neglect from those opposite, this government has deliberately turned around the importance of training apprentices and people in traineeships. This government has made an enormous difference: from 141,000 people involved in vocational education and training, as apprentices and trainees, to 400,000. That is a fundamental change. Now let us look at it in dollar terms. The Australian government's contribution to states and territories has grown from $777.9 million under Labor to $1.13 billion. In fact, there is legislation that drives that up, indexing the base to $1.154 billion under this government. That is an increase of over 45 per cent. Those statistics speak for which side of politics is focusing on the trades skills shortage, and has done for almost a decade, compared to those who neglected it for over a decade. Those figures underscore the fact that this side of Australian politics understands very clearly the way to guarantee ongoing growth on top of the already tremendous growth that we have. The Treasurer has outlined the enormous way in which this economy is demanding more and more people with more and more skills. This government is addressing that.There is one last point, and this is where those opposite have got the biggest problem of all. All members on this side know it, but those opposite still have not cottoned onto it. On this side of the chamber we are not afraid of the Australian workers driving up their wages based on the productivity they are achieving. We are not afraid of the Australian workers gaining an additional dividend in their pay packet because of the skills they have. Those opposite like to reward mediocrity; we do not.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I want to make it very clear that the Australian government will not walk away from the Regional Partnerships program. It is a program that we are very proud of. In July this year I agreed to provide a grant, under the Regional Partnerships program, of $1.1 million to facilitate the establishment of an ethanol plant in Gunnedah.I made that decision because this project offers substantial benefits to the area, which has been severely impacted by drought. This project could lead to the employment of an estimated 500 construction workers and result in 50 new permanent employees. It is also anticipated that the establishment of this plant could expand the local economy by some $169.5 million and increase household income by some $30.5 million. It could also create some 694 new permanent positions throughout the economy and provide additional revenue for the struggling local grain farmers in that area by increasing demand by some 300,000 tonnes per annum.This application had been recommended under the Namoi Valley Structural Adjustment Package. It had also been recommended by the New England North West Area Consultative Committee, and it was also recommended by the Namoi Valley Advisory Committee in June 2003. The Namoi package is funded through Regional Partnerships. The project met both the strategic opportunity guidelines and the Namoi Valley Structural Adjustment Package guidelines. It is a project that will bring significant benefits to the Namoi Valley region and to the communities there. - No. - No.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. Retail trade for the month of October fell in nominal terms by 0.7 per cent, offsetting 0.7 per cent in September. In annual terms, the retail trade turnover has moderated to 3.5 per cent in October, down from 5.8 per cent in September. In addition to that, today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released monthly building approvals figures showing private sector building approvals fell 2.8 per cent in October and are now 22 per cent lower over the course of the year. This is the seventh consecutive monthly fall in building approvals and is consistent with other indicators which show a slowing in the housing market. They include lower auction clearance rates, falls in new housing and finance commitments, and moderating growth in house prices. I have been saying for some time now, probably for two years, that the government would prefer to see an easing in the housing market. All of the indicators, including today's building approvals figures, indicate that there is an easing in the housing market. Although private house approvals rose 1.1 per cent in October, they are 15.2 per cent lower over the year. Medium-density approvals are now 35.3 per cent lower over the year. In addition to that, today we had the RBA monthly credit series showing a moderation in the growth of household credit, which rose 1.2 per cent in October and is now 13.5 per cent higher over the year, which is well below the peaks that we saw in January.These partial indicators seem to be showing some slowing in relation to consumption and some easing in relation to the housing market. That is consistent with an economy which is perhaps not growing at the pace at which it was growing earlier in the year and is consistent with moderation, which the government will in fact welcome. Tomorrow, we will get the September national accounts. Yesterday's balance of payment figures will detract quite substantially from those national accounts, which will be released tomorrow. I indicate, as I have now been indicating for probably the past year or 18 months, that some easing in the housing market is a welcome development in the economy. It means that sustainability will be better in the medium term. That sustainability is important if we are going to keep unemployment at the now record low of 5.3 per cent which we have seen in recent months.</DOC>

 - This project, as I said earlier, is an important project to the community in the Namoi Valley. -  - Those opposite do not seem to realise the importance of these projects to communities in regional and rural Australia, and that is why they will spend a very long time on the opposite benches. This program was approved under the Regional Partnerships program, funded through the Strategic Opportunities Notional Allocation, known as SONA. This practice was piloted under an earlier regional program, the Regional Assistance Program, which has been incorporated into Regional Partnerships. The Australian National Audit Office reviewed it and suggested improvements on how decisions on projects of national significance are made. With the establishment of Regional Partnerships, the recommendations made by the ANAO were incorporated into the guidelines for assessing such projects. This was an important national project and it was important to the communities of the Namoi Valley, and that is why it was approved under the Regional Partnerships program.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Goldstein for his question. I congratulate him on his election to this place and recognise the hard work that the member for Goldstein has done in previous occupations in representing and improving the circumstances for particularly Australia's agricultural community in the export markets of the world. He recognises the importance of opening up markets and improving access to markets across the world.Australia's trading relationship with China at the moment is in excellent shape. It has been growing rapidly over recent years. In fact, the total trade has trebled in value over the last five years to $27.3 billion. China is now Australia's second largest merchandise export market. Merchandise exports grew by 22 per cent over the last year, September quarter to September quarter. In the key areas of agriculture we do $2.2 billion worth of business. In the services sector it is $1.2 billion worth, which includes the tourism industry, where we had about 175,000 inbound tourists from China, and the all-important education sector, where Australian institutions are educating about 58,000 Chinese students. That is earning major export dollars for Australia. The mining and energy sector earns about $3.8 billion in exports to China, and this is before we start exporting LNG to China. Then there is the all-important manufacturing sector, which earns $1.8 billion.As members would know, we are aiming to conclude the feasibility study on a free trade agreement with China by the end of the first quarter next year. If that proceeds to negotiations and we negotiate an FTA with China, it would present us with opportunities to improve the access circumstances for those industries, like tariff barriers and quarantine protocols as far as our processed food products going out of Australia to China are concerned; better access for educational institutions, legal firms and telcos in the services sector; removal of tariff barriers and investment restrictions for the mining and resources sector; and, of course, the all-important manufacturing sector and looking after the intellectual property rights of some of our modern high-tech manufacturers.So it is important to note that if, on top of the work that we have done in South-East Asia, the work the Prime Minister is doing at the ASEAN meeting now, the agreements we negotiated with Singapore and Thailand and the agreement we hope to negotiate with Malaysia, we should go ahead and negotiate an agreement with China it would build on the already very strong economic relationship with China. Our agenda is about creating jobs and expanding Australia's export opportunities. We are a government that is about getting on with deepening our economic integration with our near neighbours in the Eastern Hemisphere.</DOC>

 - I have not seen the comments by the proponent, but the project was approved under SONA, the Strategic Opportunities Notional Allocation program, and it did meet all the guidelines. As I said, it was supported very strongly by the community. It was supported by the area consultative committee. These projects are initiated in the community; they are driven by the community. They are important to the communities throughout rural and regional Australia. It is an important project, and it was approved under the guidelines. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Braddon for what is, I believe, his maiden question and congratulate him on his wonderful election victory as well as the people of Braddon on his election. Members of the House would be aware that the New South Wales government set up a special commission of inquiry into the James Hardie group of companies. That inquiry has now concluded and the records from that inquiry have been handed across to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to be used for investigations to see whether or not there have been contraventions of the Corporations Law.Many of the materials that have been handed across are subject to claims of legal professional privilege, and ASIC asked the New South Wales government to lift those claims so that it could use those materials. The New South Wales government, notwithstanding the request of ASIC, failed to do so. Today I therefore announce that the Commonwealth government will introduce legislation to lift claims of legal professional privilege in relation to materials handed by the New South Wales government to ASIC and, to avoid any doubt, to confirm that, in exercising its powers under the ASIC Act, claims of legal professional privilege will not be able to defeat ASIC in obtaining information or material to investigate whether or not there has been a contravention of the Corporations Law by the James Hardie group of companies.We realise that this is unusual legislation, that it is company specific legislation, but the Commonwealth believes that, in the circumstances, it is warranted legislation. This will enable Australia's corporate regulator to investigate not only the company but directors and executives of the company to determine whether or not there has been a contravention of the law. On behalf of the Commonwealth government, I say that the Commonwealth government believes that no company should be able to alienate assets outside the Australian jurisdiction in order to defeat legitimate claims that it knows and reasonably believes will be made against it. Regardless of the legal situation, I call on James Hardie to ensure that it adequately funds the compensation fund which is there for those who are legitimate claimants against the company.If James Hardie deals with that matter itself then the likely legislative responses are going to be less intrusive than if it fails to do so, but I indicate that, in addition to that issue, which is perhaps the most important issue - that is, the funding of legitimate claimants and people entitled to compensation - this government will ensure that all investigations into potential contraventions of the act can be made and, as an indication of the determination with which this government intends to pursue this matter, special legislation will be introduced this week. I hope that, with the concurrence of the opposition, it will be passed very swiftly through the Commonwealth parliament. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and I will seek to answer it as comprehensively as I can. The first point I make is that I have sought at all times to observe probity in this matter. -  - Are you interested in the answer or not? I am sure that the request that came forward for reconsideration of this matter was handled by other ministers. I will give you the background to this. I am glad that this was raised, in a way. I think it is fair to say that Australians everywhere would want our resources returned to sustainability where there are serious problems with overallocation.I constantly hear across the nation how we have to ensure the health of the Murray-Darling Basin and of the Murray River. Unfortunately, in restoring our water systems across the nation to equilibrium, there are a lot of communities who, through no fault of their own, are going to face massive and real economic dislocation. Unfortunately for me, the first cab off the rank - we have got perhaps the ugliest and most dislocating of all these needs to restore our river systems and ground water systems to balance - happens to be the Namoi, in my electorate. - I will come to it, Member for Hotham. You are always in a hurry, but I will come to it. You have asked the question; I want to outline some background to this. Successive governments of all political persuasions over many decades in New South Wales have, regrettably, seriously overallocated water. That is one of the big environmental and social issues that this country faces. To get it back into order, for some decades now - and I see the member for Page nodding, because he has some background in this - New South Wales governments of different persuasions have been trying to find a way to do this reasonably fairly.What happened in the case of the Namoi was that we agreed to help New South Wales - I thought it was pretty generous of us, actually - cope with the adjustment issues. Over a 10-year period they agreed to put in $20 million and we agreed to put in $20 million. The community was pretty concerned, but that paled into insignificance beside the economic loss and the job losses - which, incidentally, are worse in the towns than they are on the farms - which those communities along the Namoi are looking at over the next 10 years.The structural adjustment package that was set up was to be oversighted by a Namoi Valley structural adjustment committee. They started to take proposals from the community. Eight or nine were put forward, including this one. Many of those were progressed and ticked off. Around $2 million, from memory, was allocated. But this one was caught in a circumstance where some more detail was sought. The water-sharing plans were then suspended by the New South Wales minister, Craig Knowles. I applauded him for that, and I continue to. We found a level of cooperation in trying to deal with this very difficult issue that I had not previously experienced with the New South Wales government. For a long time now - for much longer than we could ever have expected - we have been debating how to take those water-sharing plans forward. The adjustment program was suspended. It was never intended that it be suspended for long. It was always known that the adjustment issues would not go away and that the adjustment pressures would remain very large, very real and very significant.What happened then was that this program which had been checked off by the adjustment committee and recommended for funding - the department sought more information - was brought forward again on the basis that time was running out to get the ethanol plant up and running. With the ethanol plant goes something that those towns and, I have to say, the New England region are very concerned about, and that is a gas pipeline. If the ethanol plant does not go ahead, you do not get the gas pipeline. Both are seen as integral to trying to secure some economic future and jobs for those hard-hit towns.I would have thought that people everywhere would recognise in those circumstances that, just as the New South Wales government, to its credit, is trying to find its way through these very difficult issues, so are we. So the thing was brought back to the table. I believe that the right thing was for me to handle it at arm's length. It does comply with the Namoi Valley adjustment guidelines. It also complies with the SONA guidelines. I make this point about the SONA guidelines: no-one who has been in government would recognise that a government can leave itself in a position where it cannot respond to real challenges or real opportunities on behalf of Australian people, and neither do we.The SONA guidelines, as the previous minister indicated, have been worked up with the help of the Auditor-General, who made some helpful remarks, and they have been put in place. This project happens to satisfy both sets of guidelines. There is no conflict. I do not believe anything wrong has been done. I say to you and I say to the House that this issue of water sustainability in Australia is a very difficult issue. There are a lot of communities across Australia who are going to wear a great deal of pain as we get our river systems and our water back into equilibrium. The nation has benefited hugely from the creation of wealth by the activities of the people who have used that water. They need now to share in the burden - the real burden - that those communities are going to bear in trying to get back to equilibrium.I make this final point: those who put this application together are good people who acted in good faith, struggling desperately to try to find a future for very hard-hit communities. There was a rally, which mainly consisted of workers in the town of Gunnedah, when the then minister for water in New South Wales came and said, `There will be no help for any of you.' The outcry was enormous from good, honest, decent people who could face no future. I have been involved in this fight ever since to find a rational, sensible way forward. It is not easy, but I say this: the idea that we would leave decent Australians without a job when, through no fault of their own, water adjustments have to be made is anathema to me. I believe I have acted properly at all times, I believe the ministers have, and I think that is the end of the matter. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Casey for his question and the interest he shows in this issue. Let me say that the government - and honourable members will not be surprised to hear this - is very committed to helping Iraq through this difficult transition from dictatorship to democracy. I made this point yesterday when with great pleasure I met with the Iraqi ambassador, Mr al-Shibli, who has now arrived in Canberra. All I can say to the House is what I said to him, and that is that the government are immensely proud of the role we have played in liberating the people of Iraq and the role we are continuing to play to contribute to security not only for our personnel there but for the people of Iraq through the process of training the Iraqi defence forces.Our humanitarian contribution is also important. Honourable members may be interested to hear that very recently the Paris Club, of which we are a member, reached agreement to forgive 80 per cent of Iraq's debt. Forgiveness of Iraqi debt will obviously ease a great deal of the pressure, to use a phrase, on Iraq. That clearly is a good thing. I think also it is important to note the growing international commitment to helping Iraq. We saw that recently at the Sharm El Sheikh conference, which was attended by some of Iraq's neighbours and the G-8 countries.Despite the challenges that Iraq has - and nobody is trying to underplay those; they are very difficult - I think that as a country it is making progress, particularly towards the elections, which are scheduled for 30 January. We will help with those elections. We provided the UN with $5 million in assistance for the electoral processes. We are in the process of equipping the Fiji military deployment, which is going to assist with the protection of the United Nations.The honourable member asked whether there are any other policies. There are, of course, those from our friends in the opposition. Before the election they had nine different policies on `troops out by Christmas'. It is good to see that, in just seven weeks since the election, they have already come up with a new policy. It is the 10th policy for 2004. Actually, it is the 10th policy since 23 March 2004. - There are four weeks to go until Christmas, so we could move on to the 11th. That has been foreshadowed already by the member for Griffith, who says that, when the Labor Party now contemplates what policy it will have on our troops in Iraq, it will consult the United States - and it is good to hear that the Labor Party is wishing to speak to the United States government - it will consult the Iraqi interim government and, of course, it will consult the United Nations. That would be a given.What will the United States and the Iraqi interim government tell the Labor Party? They will tell the Labor Party that we should not cut and run. We should stand by the people of Iraq and support them, not cut and run or scurry away. That will be the advice the Labor Party get, I can promise you. They will get no cut-and-run advice from the Americans and they will get no cut-and-run advice from the Iraqis. Not even the United Nations will be saying that Australia should cut and run. I look forward to the 11th policy on `troops out by Christmas'. The 11th policy will be the one, presumably, which supports the government. I know the Labor Party is reviewing all of its policies after the tragic election loss. It presumably did not really believe in all of the policies it took to the election because, having lost the election, it said it would have to change them all. If you believed in them, you would stick by them and fight for them. But when it comes to Iraq you have decided that, having told the Australian people that if they voted Labor they would get the troops out of Iraq and having lost the election, you are not quite sure what you are going to do. It is a sorry indictment that a political party once led by Ben Chifley and John Curtin is now led by a person who has become known as the `dead parrot', a man who has distinguished himself by parroting Dick Morris and other American politicians.</DOC>

I just make this point: I do feel that the member for New England has some right to be aggrieved when it comes to statements put before parliament. I have to say that. We are in a situation, I say to the member for New England, where he has made outrageous allegations based on hearsay which he has not been able to substantiate anywhere else, which he will not repeat anywhere else and which, I note, nobody is prepared to back or take up, not even those opposite.

 - I thank the member for Bowman for his question. I congratulate him on the patriotism and idealism of his pre-parliamentary life. I have to say that is the finest question that a member for Bowman has asked in this place, at least since 1998. In answer to the member for Bowman, let me say that the government accepts that older people have greater health care needs and higher health care costs than the rest of the community. That is why concession card holders, including most people over 65, have access to the MedicarePlus safety net at a lower threshold. That is why the government is proposing to extend higher private health insurance rebates to people over 65. According to members opposite -  - On the general point, but not on the legislation, I just point out to the House that the member for Lalor, the shadow minister for health, has said that older Australians will not need their private hospital cover because they ought to have something known as Medicare Gold. Medicare Gold was the idea that people over 75 should be able to have whatever health care they want absolutely when they want it and that it should be totally and absolutely free. The idea was that this cornucopia of care should be given to every person over 75 at a net additional cost of just under $1 billion. - The member for Hotham says it was a good idea - he is becoming increasingly isolated. The member for Melbourne said that Medicare Gold destroyed Labor's economic credibility. The chief of staff to the member for Brand said that Medicare Gold was a strategic disaster. Peter Botsman, a co-author with none other than the member for Werriwa himself, described Medicare Gold as having `the head of a donkey' and `the body of a wombat'. Don't they love their barnyard analogies, their animal images, over there! Then there is Barry Jones, the incoming National President of the Australian Labor Party, who said that the Medicare Gold policy was just `a turkey'.And there is the member for Lalor. She is still in denial - she still thinks that Medicare Gold was a piece of inspired Whitlamism. In one of Canberra's most surreal and bizarre press conferences ever, the member for Lalor went out and had this to say:No-one in caucus spoke against Medicare Gold - not one person. The people who did speak were largely marginal seat holders who were congratulating me on the policy and making the point about what a difference it had made to their electoral prospects.So it is a much smaller caucus and they all have much smaller margins - and she still thinks that it was a great policy. And the member for Werriwa wanted her to be the shadow Treasurer. I say this: if the member for Lalor was passed over for two roosters, I reckon that makes her a right galah. Whether they are roosters, whether they are galahs or whether they are just plain old dead parrots, there is one thing you can say for sure: Christmas cannot come too soon for the turkeys opposite.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The first point is that he has had a bit of a problem recently in not quite knowing what his leader's policies have been. There was a thing called the forest policy that he did not know too much about. But what he also apparently did not know when he asked the question was that the Leader of the Opposition went up there and supported this project as well. - There is a bit of a problem with members being not quite aware of what their leaders and their senior members are up to. We had the member for Lyons up there the other day complaining bitterly that a dog with a skin disease had been wandering around his electorate and that he had not been told about it as well - a canine with a skin disease!This is ridiculous, because what they are really trying to say is that a political party seeking to put its case before the people ought not to spell out what it is prepared to do - across a whole range of things: from economic management, health care and social policy to how it might respond to individual problems in individual electorates. Wyong council submitted an application under the Regional Partnerships program in June 2004 for $748,000 to dredge Tumbi Creek and dispose of the material in an environmentally friendly way. That was approved. It represented a third of the cost, with Wyong council and the state government to each fund a third as well. But guess what? They have got a few financial problems down in New South Wales and they would not come to the party. So the Prime Minister, not wanting to see this important project left out cold, made an announcement on 26 August during a visit to the Central Coast that we would ensure that it could go ahead. How the Labor Party can criticise that I am really not quite sure, when they supported it anyway. It is a bit like the Scoresby Freeway. Why didn't they just go along to Mr Carr and say, `Come on, old chap, there is an election on; you ought to do the honourable thing and cough up the money'? He would not do it with Mr Bracks and he would not do it with Mr Carr.Mr Speaker, I will tell you what I would really like to see from the Leader of the Opposition. I would like to see the application forms with all the details that they received when they undertook to fund $1.5 million for a turtle interpretation centre. They love these animals - they really do! That had secured funding from state and local government authorities, but an approach had never been made to the Australian government. It was announced by Kerry O'Brien, who has a lot of interest in these matters, on 20 September. And what about the $3 million for the sporting complex at Thuringowa and the $6 million to upgrade the Rockhampton showground? I would like to see the application forms; I would like to see the business cases - or are you saying that you would not have done them had you won government? This is ridiculous. It is as ridiculous as the Independents saying that they are somehow above this. The member for New England trots up to Armidale and says, `You know I'm campaigning for a hung parliament, and if I get it I promise that this university will get a medical school and a vet school.' What is the cost of that and where was the application form?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question. There are now more than one million independent contractors in Australia, and many of them are the small business people who operate their businesses in the electorate of La Trobe and right throughout this land. It is great to see the member representing their interests in this parliament. In order to protect that more than one million independent contractors, this government will introduce legislation in the parliament to protect their legal position. This is honouring a commitment which the government made in the recent election campaign.As honourable members know, the current industrial relations system is based on a paradigm based on the employer-employee relationship. It is one which does not specifically recognise independent contractors. So the government will introduce legislation to protect the legal independence of independent contractors. It will seek to prevent unions from applying to the Industrial Relations Commission to have them roped into industrial relations awards by deeming these dependent contractors to be employees.What the government seeks to do stands in stark contrast to the Australian Labor Party's current industrial relations platform, which calls for independent contractors and others in employment type relationships to be deemed as employees. This would allow a free-for-all for unions to rope these independent contractors into the industrial relations system. We see an example of precisely that at this very time in South Australia, where the South Australian Labor government has a bill before the parliament in that state to rope independent contractors into the industrial relations system by deeming them to be employees.That is the current industrial relations policy of the Australian Labor Party, but I notice there is some hope. Recently, the Leader of the Opposition went to Ballarat to eulogise those who had been involved in the Eureka uprising. The Leader of the Opposition had a few things to say, including -  - No, not to the Premier of Victoria. I do not think they are speaking at this stage. The Leader of the Opposition had a few things to say, and about the miners involved in the uprising at Eureka he said:They were self-employed men, small-scale entrepreneurs - in today's language, `economic independents'.He also said:Call me sentimental, but I love the thought of it.So there is hope. Is this a change of policy? Are we going to see a reversal from the Australian Labor Party? Instead of wanting to deem contractors as employees and rope them into the industrial relations system, are we seeing the glimmer of a change where in fact the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party are going to reverse their policy and, when this legislation comes before the parliament, we can expect the support of the Australian Labor Party? I will be consulting with business, with independent contractors and with others over the next couple of months, and we will be bringing this legislation back to the parliament. Let us see then whether the Leader of the Opposition's words add up to reality or are just more rhetoric. </DOC>

 - First of all, I congratulate the honourable member for Wentworth for his maiden question. It is a very thoughtful question and it demonstrates a point about the member for Wentworth - that he has come to this House to make a serious contribution, including in the area of foreign affairs. -  - Mind you, there is no evidence any of you have come here to make a serious contribution - that is, the few of you who got back here. -  - I know you hate to be reminded. - The government is very concerned about measures which have been taken by the Vanuatu government that do, frankly, wind back progress towards good governance and economic reform, weaken Vanuatu's ability to combat transnational crime and threaten its security and prosperity. Actions that they have taken include the reappointment of officials charged with serious offences, interference in judicial processes, attempts to weaken legislation to monitor financial transactions and reduction of press freedom.Australian government officials went to Vanuatu from 23 to 26 November to make it clear to the government there that they should commit to upholding the rule of law, maintaining the integrity of Vanuatu's institutions, pursuing economic and governance reform and combating transnational crime. The simple fact is that Australia provides a lot of development assistance to Vanuatu, and I think the Australian people are happy to help the Ni-Vanuatu. On the other hand, we do not think we should be spending money on governance and economic reform programs that are not happening. If the government of Vanuatu are not to pursue improvements in the quality of governance and economic reform, we will not be funding them. It is as simple as that. We are not imposing, as the Prime Minister of Vanuatu has claimed, conditions on Vanuatu; we are simply saying that the government of Vanuatu should make a credible commitment to Vanuatu's own laws and institutions and continue with policies of good governance and economic reform - policies which have been developed by previous governments in Vanuatu. Finally, we have been talking and will continue to discuss this issue with other donors such as the European Union, the United States, France, the UK and, obviously, New Zealand because we think it is important there is a coordinated approach to this problem. I hope the government of Vanuatu understands this: there is a coordinated approach and we look to help the people of Vanuatu, but we will only help them in a substantial way, particularly in the area of governance, if they themselves are prepared to pursue good policies, sensible policies and ethical policies.</DOC>

It is his first question and perhaps it may well be his last, because he may refuse the next time he is being set up with what the Treasurer calls a `Kylie'. On this side of the chamber, we ask all of the members opposite to get enthusiastically behind the Australian technical colleges initiative. It is not about duplication. People in the TAFE sector understand this clearly; state ministers understand this clearly. It is such a great pity that the Australian Labor Party are following the Education Union's line in trying to talk down what is actually all about dealing with the issue of years 11 and 12 students, and giving them an opportunity to be exposed in an even more robust way than they are currently to the trades we are short of in this country.

 - I thank the member for Wakefield, a father of two children who is concerned for their education, for his question. On 4 April this year, I received a letter from an Australian mother, who said:Dear Dr Nelson, I am a concerned mum with a son who, through no fault of his own, has been to hell and back learning to read. I have no qualifications in education and only a layman's understanding of the issues.The letter says, in part:Every year since Prep I have told his teachers that I thought he had a problem and every teacher has reassured me that he was fine, that he was working well in class, and that he was an average student. I don't understand how my son could write no more than his name at the top of the page for all of grade 3 and still be given a good report. I don't know why, when I told her my son did not know the difference between a vowel and a consonant or when to use a capital letter, his grade 4 teacher assured me it was not a problem.Today I have announced that there will be a national inquiry into reading in Australian schools.That mum is Yvonne Meyer. I have appointed that mum to a national inquiry into reading in Australian schools that will be chaired by Dr Ken Rowe. It will include deans of education, people who lead an understanding in research into teaching in Australian schools. It will include at least two parents who are articulate. It will be supported by a secretariat from my department. I have asked the inquiry to look at these things: the way in which reading is taught in Australian schools and what is happening in Australian schools, how our children are actually being taught to read, how they are being tested and, most importantly, how the next generation of teachers is being trained to teach our children how to read. -  - I say to the Labor Party through its derision and ridicule as I attempt to give this answer: just go and spend one hour at the Exodus Foundation in Sydney's inner west -  - and tell me why the state governments of this country can have a child spend five years in the education system and not read a word. Let the derision and ridicule of the Labor Party be recorded in Hansard.</DOC>

 - As I already mentioned before, what we are planning to do with the Australian technical colleges is by no means a duplication. I have learnt from the Prime Minister - as indeed all on this side of the chamber have - that you do not automatically take at face value anything those opposite have to say. They never let the facts get in the way of their attempt at a good story. As they are grabbing at straws on the slippery slide out of relevance and existence, those opposite might be wise to try and find out a little more about what is going on in a constructive way. I would be happy to take a question from the member for Page through you, Mr Speaker, on these or any other issues relating to training at any time.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and congratulate him on his re-election to this House. He has an electorate that is one of the great success stories of this country. Unemployment has dropped to 5.3 per cent in the electorate of McMillan. No doubt that is a good part of the reason why people have re-elected a Liberal member to the seat of McMillan.The member asked me about the disability support pension and the way in which this government is committed to helping people that have a capacity to work to return to work. Last week I had the great pleasure of releasing the findings of a pilot study conducted by the department which targeted 671 people on a disability support pension. One of the impressive findings of that pilot was that over one in three of those people were able to find some sort of employment outcome. It did not matter whether they went into part-time, casual or full-time employment or an educational training outcome. What it provided to us as a government was a signal that many of those people are willing and able, have a capacity to work and should be given every encouragement to work.Why do we have a different philosophy in this regard to the Australian Labor Party? It is very simple. Over the last 20-odd years, there has been a 300 per cent increase in the number of people on a disability support pension. At the same time, the Australian population has only increased by about 35 per cent. So there has been almost a tenfold increase. Instead of forgetting about those people as the Australian Labor Party would advocate, our government have been serious about helping into work those people that are able to work, because if they can find an employment outcome it is better for their self-esteem, it is better for their financial prosperity and it is better for their family; it provides a better role model for their family. Our government remain committed and are only enthused by the findings of this report to help into work people who have a disability but who have a capacity to work. Those people who have a profound disability, those people who are unable to work, will continue to have the support of the government.I want to continue to support the work of the Job Network members. I say to the Australian Labor Party today: follow the lead of your leader, who in the past has supported reform in this area; follow the lead that the member for Werriwa has provided in a past time for reform in this area. He has changed his tune today. I know that Senator Conroy has been reported as describing him as `erratic' and `mad'. I am not sure if that is right, but if I had to place a bet I would go with the `mad' option.  -  - We know that he has been all over the shop on this issue, as he has been on many issues. He is erratic on this issue, as he is on many. - I am reporting comments which were recorded in the press. - I withdraw `mad' - but he is still erratic.</DOC>

 - We put ourselves up to the electorate. The Prime Minister is in Vientiane today participating in the historic Australia-New Zealand-ASEAN summit. I think this is a very important day in Australian diplomacy. I very much hope, and all members on this side of the House very much hope, that the Prime Minister's meeting will be successful. It is important to Australia to continue step by step, year by year, our relations with the ASEAN countries, as well as with other countries in the region and obviously beyond. Our Prime Minister and the New Zealand Prime Minister, with ASEAN heads of government, today signing off on negotiations to establish an Australia-New Zealand-ASEAN free trade area is one of the most exciting things that have happened for Australia in a long time. The Labor Party had no policies on the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation - which I suspect the Leader of the Opposition had not actually heard of until the last couple of days. That stare of his is back - it's back! - The dream of the Labor Party is clearly that the Prime Minister's visit be unsuccessful, so they are doing all they can to try to create as much controversy here as possible. I reject their tactics. I think they are pretty low tactics.</DOC>

 - I think the government has made its position quite clear in relation to this - that is, that the government believes that it has a duty to Australians to protect them in circumstances where their lives or their security might be threatened. The government of course would take that duty seriously. It would seek in all circumstances to operate with other like-minded countries in ensuring that the security and the safety of the Australian public is maintained. The people of Australia will know that, under this government, security will be strong and the nation will be strong.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can inform the House that the national accounts were released today for the September quarter, showing that the economy grew by 0.3 per cent in the quarter and three per cent through the year. Household consumption continues strongly, growing at 5.4 per cent through the year, underpinned by low interest rates, strong consumer confidence and the lowest unemployment in 27 years.There has been some slowdown in dwelling investment, both in terms of new housing and alterations. The government welcome this. The government have been saying for some time that continued large increases in prices in the housing market would not be sustainable. We welcome the fact that all of the indicators - building approvals, credit, auction clearances and prices - now indicate some slowing in that market.There was a large detraction from growth from net exports. I indicated in the House on Monday that this would occur. No doubt Australia's exporters are finding things made more difficult by the high level of the Australian dollar. The terms of trade have risen in Australia's favour by 10.8 per cent through the year and are now at their highest level since 1974.Today's national accounts also indicate that there is no strong inflationary pressure in the Australian economy, with the household consumption indicators in fact being lower than the CPI and lower than the target range the government has set with the Reserve Bank. All of this indicates that, while Australia is growing at a slower rate in this quarter than it was in the earlier quarters of the year, prospects for the economy remain strong, supported by good consumer sentiment, low interest rates and strong employment. It indicates that important economic management must continue and reform must continue. The best thing we could do for the Australian economy is to pass the government's reform agenda, particularly in relation to industrial relations, to make Australia a more competitive place and to give young people greater opportunities. </DOC>

 - There is of course no confusion. The government's position is absolutely clear and consistent - that is, that the government will act to protect Australians and to protect their security. We will act in concert with countries in the region who also want to make sure that their countries are not used as terrorist bases or used to attack Australians.I think that Australia's position in the region is well understood and is admired. It was the Australian assistance to Indonesia that actually managed to bring to justice the Bali bombers. It was our cooperation with the police of Indonesia which is giving them opportunities in relation to winding up terrorist threats. If anybody wanted evidence of this government's ability to work in concert with the nations of South-East Asia they got it overnight when this government opened up the opportunity for a free trade agreement with ASEAN - an agreement which the so-called experts on South-East Asia, the Australian Labor Party, were unable to progress during 13 years of government. - `Absolute rubbish,' says the member for Hotham. Oh, I missed the Australia-ASEAN free trade agreement that was signed between 1983 and 1996, did I? - I missed it, did I? - The member for Hotham is the Labor Party's sound effects man down on the front bench. - I was asked about the understanding of Australia's position in the region, and I am making the point that Australia's position in the region, as demonstrated by this breakthrough agreement, is stronger than it has been for a very long period of time and certainly much stronger in the region than it was between 1983 and 1996. - The sound effects man is at it again with his interjections. He beats in time, but not to the drum of his own party. I indicate that Australia's position is well understood. Our cooperative relations with Asia are as good as they have been. I think both sides of the House would actually welcome this wonderful breakthrough that has occurred overnight. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. I congratulate him on an outstanding job in the recent election to win the seat of Stirling for the government. During the summit in Vientiane yesterday, leaders from ASEAN, Australia and New Zealand agreed to launch free trade agreement negotiations between the 12 countries. This is an historic development in Australia's engagement with South-East Asia. An ASEAN FTA will consolidate Australia's ongoing economic integration with South-East Asia. An ASEAN FTA will boost trade and commercial links with one of the most vibrant economic regions in the world.The 10 countries of ASEAN are home to 545 million consumers. They generate a combined GDP of almost $US700 billion. They are currently growing at an average GDP growth of 5.5 per cent per year. An FTA will present Australian exporters with new commercial opportunities in this enormous and expanding market, delivering the progressive elimination of tariff barriers in trade, goods, services and investment. It will lead to further job creation in our export sector - a sector that has helped contribute to the growth in jobs in the Australian economy since 1996, which now stands at 1.4 million jobs since this government was elected.Negotiations on this agreement will begin early in 2005 and are forecast to be concluded early in 2007. They will build on the existing closer economic partnership agreement we have already negotiated with the 10 ASEAN countries that was signed in 2002. The last time an Australian Prime Minister was invited to an ASEAN leaders summit was in 1977. If my memory serves me correctly, Mr Speaker, I do not think you were in the House then. At that meeting, leaders demonstrated a mutual desire for ASEAN, Australia and New Zealand to enhance dialogue, relations and cooperation. I am pleased to inform the House that 27 years later that mutual desire has now become a reality.</DOC>

The answer to the second part of the question is that the board has indicated that it will honour the contract and, as the majority shareholder in the company, we believe that the contract should be honoured. That is the way in which corporations operate. When they enter into contracts, reputable corporations tend to keep them. We would say that this is a reputable company and that it is obliged to keep its contracts.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Tangney and congratulate him not only on his maiden question but also on his election to the House of Representatives. I know that the people of Tangney will be well represented by him.Yesterday's ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand summit was a truly historic event in the history of Australian diplomacy. It brings together the ASEAN leaders as well as our Prime Minister and the New Zealand Prime Minister. The summit was more than just symbolic: it was a practical expression of the very deep relations Australia enjoys bilaterally, regionally and collectively with the countries of South-East Asia. A key achievement was the launch of the negotiations to establish an ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand free trade agreement. But the leaders also issued a declaration highlighting cooperation between Australia, New Zealand and ASEAN in areas like counter-terrorism; combating transnational crime; looking at ways of building the economies of the region, or at least the less developed economies of the region; and addressing some of the key social and health issues of the region such as SARS, avian flu and HIV-AIDS.This was an enormously important event and it does demonstrate a couple of points that I think really need to be understood. Firstly, Australia's engagement with Asia is something that is continuing to grow year by year and very successfully. Secondly, we have been able to do that and maintain a very strong alliance relationship with the United States of America. By being able to do both - not just one, but both - of those things, we have been able to enhance the security and the economic interests of Australia to an extent that we never could have done if we had pursued any alternative proposal.I note that at the end of the summit the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Dr Abdullah Badawi, publicly indicated, as the host of the next summit to take place in Kuala Lumpur, that he would welcome Australia's and New Zealand's participation. The Prime Minister has made it clear that such an invitation would be warmly accepted by Australia. We look forward to continuing to build that engagement with Asia. The last 24 hours have been an historic 24 hours in the history of Australian diplomacy. When that history is written there will be a footnote, and that footnote will be that on the very day of these historic developments the Australian Labor Party moved a matter of public importance condemning Australia for its relations with Asia. That is the footnote that will be the Australian Labor Party.Government members - Shame, shame!</DOC>

 - I welcome the question from the Leader of the Opposition in relation to Regional Partnerships and the SONA projects. The strategic element of Regional Partnerships is used to fund projects of high national significance that may fall outside the administrative constraints of Regional Partnerships. It is important to stress that these projects are assessed in the normal way, including being consistent with the purpose of Regional Partnerships and the program assessment criteria of clear outcomes, benefit to the community, partnerships and sustainability. All projects funded under this arrangement are placed on the public record on my department's web site. This process is totally transparent. So far, 12 projects, all of which are very worthwhile projects, have been funded under these arrangements.  - I hear the interjection, `Which electorates?' There is a very important project called Beef Australia in the electorate of Capricornia. - The Leader of the Opposition asked about the SONA projects, and I am pleased to inform the House about some of the projects. One of them is Beef Australia 2006 in the electorate of Capricornia. Under the SONA guidelines, $2.2 million was approved for this project. There was another project approved under the SONA guidelines, and that was in the electorate of Lingiari. The Christmas Island mobile upgrade project was for some $2.5 million, and again it was approved under the SONA guidelines. - As I was saying, under Regional Partnerships there are some very important projects in the national interest, such as the ethanol project in the Namoi Valley and the Christmas Island mobile upgrade project at some $2.5 million. The opposition seems to think there is something untoward about the Strategic Opportunities Notional Allocation guidelines. There is nothing untoward about this. These are important programs. I am happy to table documents in relation to this. I am happy to table the minutes of the Namoi Valley Structural Adjustment Package subcommittee meeting which approved the funding of the ethanol project. I am also happy to table a letter from Kevin Humphries, chairman of the Namoi Valley Area Consultative Committee, to former minister Wilson Tuckey, which again highly recommended the project. I am also able to table the Namoi Valley Structural Adjustment Package project assessment and the procedures for the Strategic Opportunities Notional Allocation, SONA, guidelines.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for, I think, his maiden question, and again congratulate him on his outstanding victory in winning for the government the seat of Kingston in South Australia. The answer to the question is that it is all about jobs. The announcement overnight that ASEAN has agreed to begin negotiating an FTA with Australia and New Zealand is another clear illustration that we are achieving results from our comprehensive trade strategy, particularly with Asia. This includes not only our objective of negotiating the FTA with ASEAN but also the free trade agreement that is now in force with Singapore, the free trade agreement with Thailand, the scoping studies with China and Malaysia, a trade and economic framework agreement with our major trading partner, Japan, and ongoing trade facilitation through APEC. This, of course, is all underpinned by our efforts in the multilateral system to achieve a successful outcome in the global trade round. There is a strong political commitment in East Asia to continue the ongoing economic engagement with Australia. If you want a clear demonstration of this, you should look no further than the invitation that was extended overnight to the Prime Minister to attend next year's meeting of ASEAN leaders at the summit in Kuala Lumpur. We are doing all we can to find new and improved opportunities to rapidly and substantially expand our trade and investment opportunities with our Asian neighbours. This strategy is working and it is delivering dividends to the Australian economy and creating jobs in the Australian economy.Since 1996, under the stewardship of our government, 1.4 million jobs have been created in the Australian economy. One in five jobs in the Australian economy rely on exports, so it could be argued that since we came to office in 1996 280,000 jobs related to export have been created. So the answer to the question is ongoing and deeper economic integration. Our Asian trade strategy is working and delivering jobs in the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - The answer to the second part of the question is yes. In relation to growth forecasts, the government has laid down a procedure, which we have followed since the Charter of Budget Honesty was enacted, which provides that the government brings down a May budget and a midyear fiscal and economic outlook. The government updates its forecasts from the budget in the midyear economic and fiscal outlook, which it will do this year, as it has done for the last nine years. I can assure the House of this, though: this government, having taken the budget out of deep deficit - where the Labor Party had put it - after having inherited a $10 billion deficit and $96 billion of Commonwealth debt, having driven the budget into surplus and having kept it there for seven surpluses, is not going to go back to deficit. We are not going to go back to Labor Party economic policy; not for a moment would we go back to Labor Party economic policy.Let me make one last point about economic credibility. Economic credibility does not come from signing pieces of cardboard. During the election campaign the Leader of the Opposition did work on his economic credibility. He went down to Melbourne, he pulled out a big piece of cardboard and he signed it. He said, `There it is. I am now credible.' The people of Australia expect a little bit more than that. They expect consistent economic policy. That is what this government has given them over the last 8½ years. It has made Australia one of the leaders amongst the developed economies of the world and this government will ensure that the reform program continues so Australia can stay there. </DOC>

 - It is a delight to answer the question from the current member for Bass in the presence of a former distinguished member for Bass in this chamber. As both of those gentlemen will know, this government is about creating more jobs for more Australians. That is why in the last 8½ years we have got 1.4 million extra jobs in this country.One of the things that small business operators all over Australia - including those from the Bass electorate, which I visited earlier this year - tell me about is the costs and the burden of the unfair dismissals regime. On Monday we had some more examples of that in the Daily Telegraph. James Hill, an electrician from Penrith in the member for Lindsay's electorate, is quoted as saying:It's a ridiculous law. An employee can do whatever he likes, and we can't do anything back.Peter Adijans, an electrical contractor from Camden in the member for Macarthur's electorate, said:It gets to the point where you think, `If it goes to unfair dismissal, I'll wear it' because it ruins the company otherwise.That is the situation. That is what small business operators around Australia are saying about the unfair dismissal system. The restaurant and catering industry has estimated that it costs on average $3,600 and around 63 hours of management time to defend an unfair dismissal claim. That is time and money that small businesses can ill afford. No wonder the Melbourne Institute, in their 2002 study, found that the unfair dismissal laws in this country are costing some 77,000 jobs. That is why tomorrow the government will reintroduce its fair dismissal reform bill. This bill will exempt employers of fewer than 20 people from unfair dismissal provisions in the Workplace Relations Act. This is a bill which on repeated occasions the Australian Labor Party has stood in the way of - has stood in the way of creating more jobs for more Australians. At least someone associated with the Labor Party can see that this is a ridiculous proposition from the ALP. Just last week, writing in the Australian, former Labor minister Barry Cohen said in an article which I would commend to members opposite:It is difficult to know where to start when listing the grievances small business has about the Labor Party. But top of the list would have to be Labor's refusal to support the repeal of the unfair dismissal legislation.This is from a former Labor minister, someone who is actually involved now in running a business and knows, like we know, that this costs jobs for tens of thousands of Australians.The Labor Party's industrial relations spokesman, Mr Smith, the member for Perth, has been saying that he is going to be much more labour friendly and business friendly. Here is a test for the Labor Party: if they are much more business friendly then they will get out of the way of this legislation and allow it through so that we can create more jobs for more Australians. Either that or the words of the member for Brand which he uttered in 2000 remain true. Let me remind the House what the member for Brand said in July 2000:We have never pretended to be a small business party, the Labor Party. We have never pretended that.The choice is there now. Support this legislation and show you have changed your mind.</DOC>

 - The IMF recently did a report on Australia where it commended Australia's economic policy and called it one of the standout economies of the world. The OECD last night released its report, again commending Australian economic management and calling it amongst the best in the world. At the meeting of the G20 in Berlin last weekend, there was a lot of discussion about the lessons that Australia has learnt and how other economies might be able, in some respects, to get guidance from them. To have an economy which has grown at a clip of above three per cent through the Asian financial crisis, the US recession, SARS, record oil prices and the worst drought in 100 years, and to have unemployment at 27-year lows, says something. - I have been asked about credit ratings. There is one big difference today from the situation in the 1980s: in the 1980s, when the Labor Party was in office, not only Standard and Poor's but also Moody's downgraded Australia's credit rating not once but twice. It was not until this government was elected that Australia was able to have its credit rating upgraded and to rejoin the international developed economies in having a AAA rating in relation to foreign currency borrowings. So the one thing that can be said unconditionally about the view of Standard and Poor's is that its credit rating in relation to the Australian economy is much more positive now than it was in the 1980s. Having said that, does that mean that Australia can rest on its laurels and not continue economic reform? No. Australia has to continue the economic reform. Just as balancing our budget strengthened us against the Asian financial crisis, reforming industrial relations will give us the productivity lift of tomorrow. This is why we have to go further. The one thing that I would say to the opposition echoes the statement that has just been made by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations: an opposition that was legitimately concerned about improving Australia's economic potential would be an opposition that was passing the government's legislation in the Senate, not opposing it. As I said earlier, the test for the opposition is not how many pieces of cardboard or how many declarations there are; the test for the member for Lilley is: can he change his party's position on fair dismissals and industrial relations - because until that time the Labor Party will not have credibility on the economy and, what is more, the Labor Party will not deserve credibility on the economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for including me in this historic occasion, the first question ever asked in this House by a member for Bonner. The Howard government has made the investment necessary to keep Medicare strong and sustainable. Since 1996, health spending has increased from under 15 per cent to over 20 per cent of the federal budget, and federal health spending has increased from 3.7 per cent to 4.3 per cent of Australia's GDP. It is a record of solid performance and steady achievement.The Leader of the Opposition said that the election should be a referendum on Medicare. The Australian people have obviously concluded that there will be no fool's gold from the Howard government. As recently as yesterday, in this parliament, the member for Lalor tried to justify the so-called Medicare Gold policy, saying that it would save some $500 million to $600 million a year. If Medicare Gold is so good, why did Barry Jones say it was an absolute turkey and why did Peter Botsman say that it was a cross between a donkey and a wombat? If it is so good, why was the member for Lalor herself in two minds about it just a week ago? I would like to quote just one section of the member for Lalor's notorious press conference of Friday a week back:REPORTER:Well, can't we get a yes or no answer on this, Julia? I mean, it's a very simple question. Is Labor still committed to free health care for over seventy fives, yes or no?GILLARD:No. Labor is saying. No. We are not ...REPORTER:Well, I mean ... no, I'm sorry, but I mean, it's a simple question.GILLARD:All right, well.REPORTER:Yes or no.GILLARD:Yeah, but it ... well, it's ... you can put it like that, but you're putting me in a position which is just -  and then she trails off. I can help the member for Lalor: her position is absolutely impossible, because it is impossible to support something in principle which simply cannot be delivered in practice. There were 27 pages of equivocation from the member for Lalor. I never really thought the member for Lalor was a religious person, but she resembles no-one so much as the Vicar of Bray, who could not say yes and could not say nay. Because her press conference deserves close study, I table the transcript.</DOC>

 - I think the question is: what is the government doing to improve Australia's trade performance? The insinuation is that the government is not doing enough to improve Australia's trade performance. - The sound effects man said on cue, `That's right.' Every now and then you get a `Kylie'. The question asks what the government is doing to improve Australia's trade prospects - on the day that Australia has entered, for the first time in its history, into negotiations for a free trade agreement with the ASEAN region. On the very day that the government has entered into negotiations for an agreement for a free trade zone in ASEAN, the implication is that the government is not doing anything to improve our trade prospects!As well as the ASEAN free trade agreement, this is the government which negotiated the US free trade agreement. This is the government which negotiated the Thai free trade agreement. This is the government which negotiated the Singapore free trade agreement. And this is the opposition which opposed very large parts of the US free trade agreement. So, if Australia's exporters want to know what this government is doing, let me tell you. This government has the most ambitious trade agenda that any Australian government has ever had. This government has more positive returns on that trade agenda than any other Australian government has had. What is more, none of that could have been done - and none of that was done - by the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question and for her very strong support for choice in education. This government believes very strongly that Australian parents should be able to choose the school that they think is the best school for their child, whether that is a government school, a Catholic school or an independent school. I say to Australian parents that, if you do choose to send your child to a Catholic or independent school, if that school draws from very poor families you will get 70c in the dollar to support the education of your child. - Since this government has been in office it has been, and as long as this government remains in office it will remain, very strongly committed to the principle that if Australian parents who have worked hard and paid their state and federal taxes choose not to send their child not to a government school but to instead send their child to a Catholic or independent school they will be supported by this government. Those children will receive financial assistance to support their education. In all cases they will receive less money than if they were in a public school, but they will be supported. - I am asked about alternative policies. It is very well known that the Australian Labor Party is opposed to parents who send their children to non-government schools. I noticed yesterday a release from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. - I got a media release yesterday from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who is Labor's education spokesperson, which is entitled `Caucus endorses Labor's education policies'. So the caucus at a meeting endorsed Labor's education policies. - So we have a release from the Labor Party that says that caucus endorses Labor's education policies - which of course would be well known to the Australian community as meaning that, in the first instance, 160,000 Australian children in non-government schools would have their funding cut under a Labor Party government and that over a six-year period all non-government schools would join that list. I read the Courier-Mail this morning, and on page 2 I read:A Caucus spokeswoman denied the decision meant Labor would again take a hit list of private schools to the next election.I thought, `Hang on; they had a hit list of schools whose funding they were going to cut, and they have endorsed their policy, but they are not going to take the hit list to the next election.' I read on:But she admitted 'there will be redistribution' -  - Apparently the Labor Party's caucus problem was not that they were going to cut the funding to parents who send their children to non-government schools, not the fact that the leadership was frothing at the mouth trying to punish parents; the problem was that they had put it in a list. So apparently the Labor Party now take their policy and confirm the policy - they will punish parents for sending their kids to non-government schools - but they remove the list. So the policy is the same. They redistribute; they cut funding from parents who send their kids to non-government schools, but apparently they are not going to put it in a list. I table the list for the benefit of the House. The Labor Party obviously continue a policy of punishment in relation to Australians.</DOC>

 - I congratulate the honourable member for Hasluck on his maiden question, and I would like to say how pleased I am to have him here as part of the Howard government team. The summit between ASEAN, Australia and New Zealand was clearly a very great success. It was part of the incremental evolution of Australia's relations with Asia, which continue to grow month by month and year by year. There are two meetings over the next week which simply illustrate that point. This evening and tomorrow I shall be hosting the South-West Pacific Dialogue with the foreign ministers of Indonesia, the Philippines, New Zealand and East Timor, as well as the Papua New Guinea minister for internal security. This meeting will take place in Victor Harbor in my electorate. It is an opportunity for all these foreign ministers from around the subregion to discuss issues such as counter-terrorism, transnational crime and, for some of the countries in the region, development issues. On Sunday I will be departing for Indonesia where I will co-host, with the Indonesian foreign minister, an interfaith dialogue which will involve the religious communities of all the ASEAN countries as well as Australia, New Zealand, East Timor and Papua New Guinea. Each country will have approximately 10 representatives at the interfaith dialogue. There has been very strong support for this event. I understand from the Prime Minister that it was frequently referred to during the recent summit in Vientiane in which the Prime Minister participated.The interfaith dialogue can, I think, play a very important part in strengthening the role of moderate religious leaders in building communal harmony and helping to fight the scourge of terrorism. This is yet another example of Australia working with Indonesia - as has happened on a number of occasions before - in providing leadership for the region. It is a very good illustration of how our country, in a quiet and unassuming way, is continuing to build ties and strengthen its relations with the countries of East Asia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Goldstein for his question. I have read his maiden speech, and I note that a considerable amount of it was devoted to the importance of trade to a nation like Australia, the ongoing economic building that has been taking place under this government and the need to maintain the focus on that. In a week when such significant events have taken place in our region, it is important to recognise the work that has been taking place on a bilateral basis with some of our key South-East Asian trading partners, of which Malaysia is a very important one. Over the years we have been building and strengthening the economic relationship with Malaysia. From 1986 to 1996, there was an ongoing officials dialogue, on an annual basis, on trade and economic matters. My predecessor, Tim Fischer, upgraded that to a joint ministerial commission, which has been conducted annually since 1996. In July this year, Minister Rafidah Aziz and I announced that Australia and Malaysia would conduct parallel scoping studies on a possible free trade agreement. That will be concluded in early 2005 and will hopefully lead to negotiations between our two countries. Malaysia is our 10th largest trading partner. Two-way trade between our countries stands at $8.6 billion, with merchandise trade at $6.9 billion and services trade at $1.7 billion. An FTA would build on the already strong links that exist between Australia and Malaysia across a broad range of areas, including education, defence, security and tourism. Clearly, there would be many opportunities for Australian exporters if we were able to open up the market further and remove impediments to accessing that market. There would be opportunities in areas such as agriculture from the reduction or elimination of tariff barriers. There would be opportunities in the all-important services sector if education institutions and legal firms could get better access to that market and build on the already 20,000 strong Malaysian student population attending Australian universities today. That is a very important link that has been built over the years between our two countries. Then there are the all-important investment flows that take place between our two countries.It is worth reflecting on how much the economic relationship has grown over the last 10 years. In 1993, the year of Prime Minister Keating's infamous comment, two-way trade between Australia and Malaysia was worth $3.9 billion. This year, 2004, the year that Malaysia has welcomed Australia's participation in this year's ASEAN summit and reflected on our participation in next year's ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, two-way trade is worth $8.6 billion. In that period it has gone from $3.9 billion to $8.6 billion. That has all happened under a coalition government focused on developing and strengthening our relationship with our regional neighbours, and in particular with countries like Malaysia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question. Today the ABS released their house price index for the September quarter, which showed an easing in house prices. House prices in Australian capital cities fell on average by 0.7 per cent in the September quarter. Following an upward revision to the June quarter - which had originally been thought to be negative but has now been revised upward - this means that the September quarter fall is the first fall since September 2000. House price growth slowed to 8.2 per cent, which is the lowest annual increase since the June quarter of 2001. What we are now seeing is a confirmation through all of the indicators of a slowing in the house market. We are seeing it in prices, we have seen it in auction clearances, we have seen it in building approvals and we have seen it in credit data. For some time the government has been saying that the rate of increase in the housing market could not be sustained and has been looking for a cooling in the housing market. There is now evidence that it is coming through. That is not an unwelcome development. It indicates that one of the hot spots of the economy is easing. Indeed, the number of first home buyers coming back into the market increased in August and September, going above 8,000, whereas back in January it was only around 5,000.Today is the anniversary of the Leader of the Opposition's leadership. We congratulate him. He has been offered good wishes on the doors by many of his colleagues but I think none was in better terms than those offered by the member for Grayndler, who said: `I think it's been a good year except for the election.' May there be many, many happy returns!</DOC>

 - I understand there are 12 programs that have been approved under those guidelines. I have no intention of tabling departmental advice. So far as I am aware, all of those 12 programs were recommended by the department after careful analysis. I see nothing out of the ordinary in relation to that. I have to say that this idea from the opposition that governments should have no discretion from time to time to meet emerging needs and to respond to important community opportunities is not supported by their actions outside this place. It really is not.Indeed, in relation to this my attention was drawn by the member for Dobell to some further commentary regarding the dredging of Tumbi Creek. The Prime Minister has been away for a few days. While he was away the member for Wills came into this place and puffed his chest up to an enormous degree and wanted to know on what basis the Prime Minister had determined that the government should offer further support to the community in that area regarding the dredging of Tumbi Creek. He looked extraordinarily embarrassed when I pointed out that no less than the Leader of the Opposition himself had also supported the dredging of Tumbi Creek, on the basis of it being a local need. But the member for Dobell has since furnished me with a copy of a very glossy brochure released by Labor's candidate, one David Mehan, during the campaign.A government member - Who's on the front? - On the front is a nice picture of a candidate with his family, but on the back -  A government member - And Mr Latham? - a small picture of Mr Latham - is a picture of a candidate with Mr Latham and another heading under another nice picture, `Labor to fund the dredging of Tumbi Creek'. I think some aspects of it really warrant reading out: `Labor's candidate for Dobell, David Mehan, says Labor will fund the dredging of Tumbi Creek with a commitment of $1.3 million to continue the project. The health of the local environment is critically important.' Is that suggesting that members of parliament might occasionally need to exercise sensible discretion on behalf of the people they are seeking to represent? And to put a case before the electorate, and let the electorate and the voters determine the outcome?I will jump to the last paragraph, because I think it says it all, given what the opposition tried to do here in the House - what was meant to be to the Prime Minister's embarrassment but turned out to be to the Leader of the Opposition's embarrassment. It says, `'Labor's decision to commit funding for the project shows how much we care about the local areas,' said Labor candidate David Mehan.' And here is the corker: `It's not about politics; it's about getting the job done.'</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question, and I would like to acknowledge at the outset that I do not think I have ever seen a member work so hard for regional communities as the member for Riverina has in relation to the very real problems that a very large number of communities faced across regional Australia when two previous airlines folded and were amalgamated into Rex. The work she put into ensuring they had a future was outstanding.I am delighted to be able to record that, after a fairly long period, it has to be said, of negotiations, Rex airlines and Sydney airport have reached agreement on access to the former Ansett terminal, T2, at Sydney airport. That is good news for Rex, but it is better news for regional commuters. That agreement, finalised on Tuesday night, will give Rex facilities at Sydney airport which are on a par with those the airline currently occupies and uses. Importantly, they are supported by a five-year lease with an option for renewal for a further five years. That will give Rex a lot of certainty, that will help them grow and invest with certainty, and I would like to commend Rex and SACL for having worked it through.I am asked about the government's policies - what impact have they had on aviation? Despite the horrors of the September 11 events in 2001, the subsequent Bali events, SARS and so forth, and the tragic demise and loss of Ansett, aviation has been growing very strongly indeed. We have seen Qantas record a record profit for the 2003-04 financial year and the launch of a low-cost carrier by Qantas, Jetstar. We saw Virgin Blue's entry into the market some three years ago. They have done extraordinarily well: an initial fleet of three aircraft has grown to over forty 737s, a very new and modern fleet, servicing some 23 domestic destinations and a growing number of international destinations through Pacific Blue. Rex has recently announced a record profit for the first four months of the 2004-05 financial year, as well as a boost in its regional flights, while Skywest recorded a solid profit for the financial year just gone as well. We have seen new regional airlines - and this is very good news - like Great Western Airlines in South Australia and Big Sky Express in New South Wales, and, only a few months ago, a national alliance of smaller carriers was launched in Adelaide, under the banner RegionalLink.The long-term health of the Australian aviation industry is evident too in the inbound tourism figures, which are now seeing a steady growth rate of over six per cent of international visitor arrivals predicted over the next decade, while on the domestic front the industry is now, in net terms, operating at record levels, with eight of the 10 busiest months in Australian aviation history occurring in the period 2003 to June 2004. So aviation is growing strongly. That of course means that there are more jobs in aviation - that is to be welcomed - but also, perhaps of even greater significance, it reflects strong business confidence, a lot of business travel and indeed a very strong and growing performance by the Australian tourism industry, which is a major employer in this country.</DOC>

 - My advice is that on 29 August 2004 the then parliamentary secretary, De-Anne Kelly, approved funding. Her reasons for approval of the project for the full amount sought were that, firstly, the in-kind contribution to the project was genuine, in that it involved intellectual property, land, equipment and transport; secondly, the funding was not directed to A2 milk but, rather, to the participating farmers; thirdly, it did not favour a monopoly and had the potential to increase farm gate prices, something that anyone who knows anything about the dairy industry would find very welcome; and, finally, farmers would have direct equity in the venture. Subsequently, I think in a demonstration that the probity requirements put in place by the department and the government work, it was determined that funding would not be forthcoming.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I was delighted to be able to launch the coalition's workplace relations policy at Blackburn Bodyworks in his electorate just a few weeks ago. It is a fine example of a company making use of Australian workplace agreements to the advantage of the workers in that company, the constituents of the member for Deakin and the company itself.The honourable member asked me about recent reports. In fact, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations report on agreement making was tabled in parliament this week. This report shows that the annual growth rate in Australian workplace agreements over 2002-03 was 35 per cent. In fact, 89 per cent of these AWAs were in the private sector and the proportion of AWAs in small businesses doubled from five to 10 per cent. This is a portent of the future for Australian workplaces. In the policy which was launched at Blackburn Bodyworks in the honourable member for Deakin's electorate, amongst other things we promised an additional $12 million to the Office of the Employment Advocate, allowing that office to further promote Australian workplace agreements in the small business sector. -  - I hear some interjections, but can I tell the honourable member interjecting that a total of 587,698 Australian workplace agreements have now been approved. For the benefit of the honourable member who is interjecting and others, the latest figures show that 18,334 Australian workplace agreements were entered into in November alone. That follows a record month of October, when 22,479 AWAs were approved and a group of 307 new AWA employers had agreements approved.We are committed to this process. Despite the good advice that Mr Rod Cameron gave to the Leader of the Opposition when he said that the attack on AWAs was misguided, recently the Leader of the Opposition said `... we don't see the need for AWAS's, our policy is unaltered.' The Australian workforce do not agree with that, because in their hundreds of thousands they are entering into AWAs.</DOC>

 - So far as I am aware, the claim that it did not meet the guidelines is simply not true. It does not register with anything in my memory. I would have to defer to the responsible minister, if she has anything to add in that regard. I was not the minister who checked it off, and I do not pretend to be able to recall full details of every incident that took place.In relation to the probity of assessing applications that come forward, these have all been through proper, transparent departmental processes. They are subject on a regular basis to the Senate estimates process. There is to be a further Senate inquiry, that is the Senate's decision, but I would just make the point that they have been exhaustive in the past. Indeed, these programs account for just three per cent of my department's administered funds, yet at the last estimate's hearings this area accounted for 20 per cent of the questions from senators - five hours in all - and 10 per cent of the questions on notice referred to my whole department. The regional program area is probed and questioned more than any other part of the department. I am sure it will be no different at future estimates hearings.In relation to this sort of concocted concern from the other side about the probity of governments making decisions and being prepared to do something out in the electorate, I actually had my department check to see how many of Labor's commitments during the election campaign had been referred to the department for consideration and advice. I have here a pretty extraordinary list of suggestions that have had no scrutiny run over them whatsoever - no scrutiny at all. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question, and I take this opportunity to congratulate him on his election as chairman of the government members backbench committee on health and ageing. The three pillars of Medicare are a universal insurance scheme for medical treatment, free treatment for public patients in public hospitals and, very importantly, affordable access to lifesaving and life-enhancing drugs. This week the government has announced two new Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme listings for drugs dealing with mental illness. Some 10,000 people with schizophrenia are expected to benefit from the listing of Risperdal Consta, at the cost of some $5,000 per patient per year. Over 20,000 people with bipolar disorder are expected to benefit from the listing of Zyprexa, at the cost of some $2,000 per patient per year. I have to say that, even with price volume agreements in place with the pharmaceutical manufacturers, these new drugs are going to cost the PBS some $50 million a year.It is very important that people have access to the best and latest drugs, but this can only be ensured if we maintain close scrutiny of the cost of the PBS. That is something which has marked the Howard government over its 8½ years. This is a government which does responsibly manage the PBS for the benefit of both patients and taxpayers. I have to say that this is one of the reasons why the opposition's support for co-payment increases before the election was so welcome and it is also one of the reasons why the opposition's backflip during the election was so irresponsible and so contemptible.</DOC>

 - I congratulate the member for Kalgoorlie on his return to this place as part of the illustrious class of '98. One of the reasons that he was returned to this place was that in the seat of Kalgoorlie, the world's largest electorate, he was part of this government's effort to ensure that there was continued growth in exports, investments and jobs. Nowhere is this growth more evident than in the LNG sector where, in 2003-04, some $2.2 billion worth of exports of LNG contributed to our national economy. The three trains of the North West Shelf have directly and indirectly provided almost 80,000 jobs in Australia. The news gets better - in a report released by ABARE this week, the consumption of LNG in the Asia-Pacific region is expected to double, from 83 million tonnes per annum to almost 150 million tonnes per annum by 2015.Australia has some 200 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and the opportunities for us to continue to share in that growth are enormous. Our government has worked hard to create the investment climate to ensure that this growth is realised, and the results of that speak for themselves - the $25 billion gas contract with China, the half a million tonnes a year of gas we sell to Korea, and our 15-year relationship with Japan supplying LNG. The best is yet to come, with further opportunities not only in Asia but now on the west coast of America.Therefore I am somewhat surprised that during the election campaign the Premier of Western Australia joined with the chorus from the other side that Australia should abandon the export opportunities that energy provides and ratify Kyoto. I remind those who sit opposite and the government of Western Australia that the effect of that on Western Australia alone would be to see by 2007-08 a 3.9 per cent drop in employment, a 50 per cent increase in electricity prices by 2015 and a jump in petrol prices of some 12c a litre. I reassure the member for Kalgoorlie, his constituents and all Australians that this government will continue to seek practical solutions to greenhouse gas emissions and will not waste export opportunities by ratifying a diplomatic piece of paper which will have no effect on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</DOC>

I do not think members would be surprised to know that I was not even aware that a meeting had happened on that day.A germane aspect of this issue is that a program came forward which looked like it might actually make a real difference in a depressed area by lifting dairy prices. It was properly assessed, and it was recommended. When it was determined, on the basis of probity checks, that there were some issues with the financial viability of some of the proponents, it was pulled. It has not gone ahead. That demonstrates quite clearly that the probity arrangements that the government and the department have in place work. </DOC>

 - My thanks to the honourable member for Maranoa for the question. He represents a very large electorate which includes many of the farmers in Australia who have been enduring drought for a very extended period. The federal government has been happy to stand by farmers during these tough times to help share with them the burden of enduring the hardship that is associated with these long dry spells. Indeed, the south-west part of Queensland, in the honourable member's electorate, has just had its EC declaration extended for a further year, joining 22 regions around Australia which will now move into a third year of assistance from the federal government.This kind of assistance is without precedent. More than 30,000 applications for assistance have been approved, and the Commonwealth have already paid out almost $580 million direct to Australian farmers to help them through this drought. We expect that, by the time the drought ends, that expenditure will be in the order of $1 billion.Members will be aware that the crop forecasts released earlier this week suggest that there will be a significant downturn in the summer grain crop. In no area will that be more evident than in the electorate of the honourable member for Maranoa. That would suggest that there are going to be continuing difficulties in quite a number of areas around Australia in the year ahead. The National Climate Centre has suggested that there is only a 50 per cent chance of average rainfall in the year ahead. So there is an ongoing need to make sure that we are able to stand by the people who are enduring the most difficult drought in our nation's history, and this government certainly stands ready to do its share.The honourable member asked what the states are doing. Frankly, very little. Most states have walked away entirely from their obligations to drought stricken farmers, except to demand that the Commonwealth do more. Many states, sadly, are doing very little. Tomorrow the agriculture ministers will be gathering again to talk about drought reform. One or two states have indicated a willingness to look constructively at the issue, and I commend those states that are taking that kind of approach. I hope that tomorrow there will be a new spirit of cooperation, a willingness to share the burden, so that all Australians can work with the rural community to endure this difficult drought.</DOC>

Audit sampling has shown a variation between what is on the computer system and what was recorded at the time. Defence has a rigorous system in place to ensure that all of its records are accurate. The military leave issue is simply a paperwork issue. Every single defence person will receive, and is receiving, their appropriate leave. We treat the defence forces with great respect. We have increased the budget for Defence. We back our defence people. All of their entitlements and their leave are paid in full.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question and welcome her back to the House yet again - she did a fabulous job down there in Adelaide. The Howard government is very much committed to working women and those who are out of the labour force being able to make a commitment for their retirement and to have a safety net, a nest egg, in retirement. To that end, we abolished the work test. Understanding that women move in and out of the work force to have a family and that they have to balance their family responsibilities with work, we want them to be able to continue to contribute to their superannuation at times when they are not in the work force.We also, of course, introduced the co-contribution. Earlier in the week I informed the House that 215,000 Australians got their first payments - on average, $510 each - as part of the Howard government's co-contribution. That was when it was based on $40,000, not the $58,000 threshold that applies this year. Of course, the co-contribution has gone up from $1 for $1, to $1.50 for each dollar.The really good news for Australian women is that 59 per cent of the 215,000 recipients of the co-contribution were Australian women earning under $40,000 who have made a contribution for their own safety in retirement so as to be independent. It has been strongly supported by every member on this side of the House. I would ask the 20 women of the Labor Party that sit opposite and the 11 Labor women in the Senate to show some influence on the member for Werriwa and on those who sit on the front bench and to say to them that it is time they stood up collectively for Australian women, whether they be in the work force or not. This side of the House will continue to say that it is every Australian woman's right to be able to make provision for her retirement and not be dependent upon a spouse. It is up to the opposition to get into the 21st century and support the Howard government's initiatives.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to answer a question from the member for Herbert, who sets a benchmark that others on this side always try to keep up with as far as advocacy for his electorate. In his electorate during the time that he has been the member we have seen a 129 per cent increase in the number of people taking out apprenticeships. That translates to some 1,784 people which, of course, is 1,784 families who feel as though their sons and their daughters are connecting in with the trades and are feeling a sense of success as a result. Just last Friday, the National Centre for Vocational Education Research report highlighted that new apprenticeship commencements in trade and related occupations had increased by 18 per cent with an estimated 66,900 commencements in the 12 months to 30 June. That is a real credit to the policies of this government and this Prime Minister, and of course the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Mr Brendan Nelson who has championed this cause. In electrotechnology, new apprenticeships are up 21 per cent; in construction they are up 15 per cent; importantly, for those who are feeling a bit hairy, in hairdressing new apprenticeships are up 23 per cent; and in the automotive industry, retail service and repair sector they are up 12 per cent.The number of young people who are continuing to commence new apprenticeships also continues to rise, with 106,200 commencements in the age group 19 years and under. Completions are also on the increase, with some 133,000 completions in the 12 months to June 2004. That is up 12 per cent on the previous year. Is it any wonder the Australian Industry Group have described these figures as some of the best news heard in this particular area of government activity for some time? The Ai Group is correct in stating that the government has made addressing skill shortages a major priority; and the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations skilled vacancy index indicated just a week ago that trade vacancies had fallen in recent months by 1.5 per cent in November and by 5.3 per cent since July of this year.We are not resting on that. We know there is a lot more to do. We have the heavy lift and we have the solid proposals. The Prime Minister has announced a further $1.06 billion over the next four years that is to be spent on initiatives such as the 24 Australian technical colleges, an Australian institute for trade skill excellence, providing a tool kit to new apprentices to skill shortage occupations, a $500 learning scholarship in each of the first two years to new apprentices and funding 5,000 places in the new apprenticeship access program to target those new apprentices; as well, and I think importantly, $100 million to establish an Australian network of industry career advisers to support youth transitions. It is an important area of government endeavour, and we are working hard and will continue to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question. He represents an electorate that exports large quantities of minerals, resources and energy, as well as large quantities of agricultural product. In fact, he would be aware that just recently the AWB sold 1.5 million tonnes of wheat to China in a single deal.What are we doing towards an FTA with China? We are currently engaged in a joint scoping study with the Chinese government into the possibility of a free trade agreement with China. This is underpinned by our excellent trade relationship with China and our excellent people-to-people linkages with China, given that over the last five years the total trade relationship has tripled to $27.3 billion and China is now Australia's second largest merchandise export market after Japan. Merchandise exports grew by 22 per cent over the last year. We are aiming to conclude the feasibility study into an FTA with China by the end of the first quarter next year.A key aspect of this study is broad consultation with exporters and industry groups within Australia, and its focus is the benefits that would accrue to both sides - from our perspective, obviously, the benefits that would accrue to Australia. It has been indicated to us by the resources sector that, if we proceed with an FTA, a reduction in tariff barriers and investment restrictions would lead to much greater exports of resources out of Australia, bearing in mind we already have that significant gas contract win that starts flowing in the next couple of years. Those exports would expand over and above the current level of mining and energy exports of $3.8 billion. Like the Thai free trade agreement and the Singapore free trade agreement, the China study is a landmark in Australia's ambitious Asian trade agenda, which includes possible FTAs with the ASEAN group and with Malaysia.The whole focus of this, from our perspective, is about expanding our export sector and therefore creating more jobs in the Australian economy. Our scoping study, which we expect to be concluded by the end of the first quarter next year, will put us in a position to make a decision about whether or not we go ahead with the free trade agreement negotiation at that point in time. We understand that some members of the Labor Party are conducting their own scoping study, but it is not about an FTA with China. So, we will be making a decision off the back of our scoping study about going ahead with an FTA with China, while members opposite conclude their scoping study about the leadership of the Australian Labor Party. </DOC>

 - I am well aware of the fact that the government has an incentive program to encourage investment in alternative fuels and alternative energies. We actually believe that there is a strong place in the Australian fuel and energy mix for alternative fuels, a position that the opposition have not been able to embrace. They can find all sorts of reasons to oppose alternative fuels, but they are never prepared to support worthwhile projects that could achieve benefits in that regard.In relation to the specifics of how many companies applied for grants under that particular program and which companies may have been successful or otherwise, I will need to seek additional information from the minister. If there is any additional information that is important, I will provide it to the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question. The Bureau of Statistics released on Friday their statistics on household income and income distribution. They showed that, unquestionably, household disposable income has been rising in Australia. In 1994 household disposable income was $445 a week. In 1995-96 it dropped to $439 a week, but by 2002-03 it had risen, almost continuously, to be $510 per week. More importantly, household disposable income increased for lower-income, middle-income and upper-income households. Over that period, the increase for the bottom fifth of households was 10 per cent; for the middle fifth, 16 per cent; and, for the top fifth, 19 per cent. You will often hear people say that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. That is not true. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting richer in Australia today. All of the measures, including household disposable income, show that.During the first period of this measurement, the rich got richer at a higher percentage than the poor got richer, although both got richer. Interestingly enough, after 2000 we saw a switcharound. After 2000 it showed that, in relation to increases, there was equality in the ratio of income increase for high-income earners and low-income earners. In other words, after 2000 there was a change: low-income earners started increasing their income at a higher rate than they had previously. Undoubtedly, the main cause of that after the year 2000 was the A New Tax System. The A New Tax System, as has been found now by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and as has been confirmed by NATSEM, actually was a great advantage for low-income earners in Australia. Those of us who were around in the year 2000 can remember how the Labor Party said that the GST would probably destroy Australia as we then knew it. That was their excuse for opposing the new taxation system. The evidence is now in: not only has Australia had four years of solid growth since, but all incomes have increased and, what is more, lower incomes have increased at a faster rate than previously.We only have these figures up to 2002-03, but things would have improved even more considerably for families since then with the introduction of the $600 additional family payment. That is $600 of real money - money that goes into bank accounts, money that comes out of bank accounts, money that buys goods and services, money which millions of families out there know to be real, money which was denied by the honourable member for Lilley, who to this day cannot bring himself to acknowledge that families are better off. That is only compounded by some of his colleagues now coming out and saying what a terrible mistake it was to say to families who are really relying on the $600 that it did not exist. -  - They interject. Mr Speaker, you will recall that during the election campaign the Labor Party tax policy was a tax policy that could make you better off every week and leave you worse off at the end of the year. It does not happen like that in the real world. If you are better off every week, you generally tend to be better off at the end of the year; and if you are worse off at the end of the year it is because you were not better off every week. This is the government that has increased household disposable income recently for those lower-income earners in our society.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The proponents did not seek funding under Regional Partnerships: they sought it under the Namoi Valley structural adjustment package.Opposition member - That wasn't part of the question. - That was part of the question; you did not hear your own question. It is very important to understand that distinction. As I said in this place last week, the stresses and strains, in economic and social terms, are very great indeed in a lot of the communities in this country that are at the cutting edge of bringing water usage back into equilibrium. The government, in conjunction with the New South Wales government, set out to try to find a decent and structured approach to helping those communities cope, with a contribution of $20 million over 10 years from each government. It was under that program that the assistance was sought, and it was subsequently recommended. It happens to fit the SONA guidelines as well. They are not secret, as you claim. Indeed, it is worth making the point: so secret are they that the Auditor-General - when remarking on the predecessor to the SONA guidelines, which was operated under RAP, the Regional Assistance Program - made some comments, which were fully published in his report at the time, about how the guidelines might be sufficiently and properly adjusted. They were published, and his recommendations were picked up.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question. Members would know of his interest in matters relating to Indigenous Australians and particularly the concern that he has - as many of us do - in relation to family violence when it occurs and wherever it occurs, whether it is amongst Indigenous people or otherwise. The government does recognise the need for better coordination, accountability and performance to produce better outcomes for Indigenous Australians. New arrangements that have been announced by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs in April this year were about three key objectives: overhauling policy settings, reshaping service delivery, and shared responsibility for outcomes.We are taking immediate action to address the issue of family violence in Indigenous communities by expanding the family violence prevention legal services by $22.7 million over four years. That will allow us to establish a further 13 services, doubling the current support for Indigenous communities in relation to family violence. The majority of those should be operational by next March. The aim is to improve access to legal services for victims of family violence and those at risk and to provide culturally appropriate responses by providing a range of services, including legal assistance and advice; crisis counselling, including sexual assault workers; referrals to other agencies; and community awareness raising initiatives about family violence. That is in addition to the $37 million over four years which is part of the Indigenous Family Violence Partnership Program, which is a flexible pool of funds already available. This new partnership program will support the approach of developing local solutions. I think it demonstrates very clearly the government's real and ongoing commitment to practical reconciliation and better outcomes for Indigenous Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canning for his question and also for giving me the opportunity to go to St Joseph's at Pinjarra to see an excellent reading program. Today in Australia we know that about one in 12 children cannot pass a very basic national year 3 reading benchmark - the benchmark tests are, of course, enforced by this government - that about one in 10 cannot pass a national year 3 reading benchmark in year 5 and that in Queensland and Tasmania about one in five boys cannot pass the national year 5 reading benchmark. This has devastating consequences not only for those children through their primary and secondary education but for them in life itself. In fact, today's Melbourne Age has run a story quoting Dr Ken Rowe, whom I have just appointed to chair the national inquiry into reading, who said:Hospitals are complaining that their clinics are being filled with kids who are being referred for things like Attention Deficit ... But once the paediatricians sort out the children's literacy problems, the behaviour problems disappear. What is essentially an education issue has become a health issue.In relation to Professor Vicki Anderson, who heads the Royal Children's Hospital's department of psychology, the article goes on to say:She said families often sought help at the Royal Children's Hospital's learning difficulties clinic because of long waiting periods at schools to have a child's learning problems assessed by Education Department psychologists.There are many things this government is doing in its determination to address the problem in reading in Australian schools. The first is that, as I announced last week on behalf of the government, there will be a national inquiry into reading, which will look at the way in which our children are taught to read in Australian schools. The second is to look at the way in which their reading skills are tested. The third, and perhaps the most important, is to look at the way teachers are trained to teach children how to read. It is of concern to me, as I know it is to the House, that a recent university study found that half of our early career teachers do not know what a syllable actually is.The government will also be distributing to 24,000 parents in the first term of next year a $700 learning tuition voucher, so they can take their child and the voucher along either to the school, if that is what they choose to do, or to a private tutor and get one-to-one tuition for their child. So perhaps - and we will be carefully evaluating this - if this proves to be a success, we will have fewer parents lined up in desperation in Australian children's hospitals trying to get treatment for a problem incorrectly diagnosed as a health problem when the real problem is that the children simply have not been taught how to read.</DOC>

 - I will say at the outset, representing Senator Patterson, that this government has been responsible for the most significant increase in child-care places of any government since Federation. Moreover, I might add, with the 30 per cent child-care rebate announced during the election - which will be delivered in full and on time - there will be better and more affordable access for many families seeking child care. It is about choice. This side of the parliament believes in choice for parents. Kelly - who may well be a fictional character - now has a choice that was not available to parents in the past, and that has come about because of the significant increase in child-care funding and places made available by the coalition government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I can inform the House that the building and construction industry is a $46 billion a year industry that employs some 775,000 Australians. Mr Justice Cole, in his royal commission report into this industry, found that the industry was characterised by a culture of lawlessness and intimidation. Indeed, the respected economic firm Econtech found that this costs Australia some $2.3 billion each and every year. Nothing much has changed in this industry. Readers of the Melbourne Sunday Herald Sun woke up yesterday morning to see the headline, in large print on the front page, `Rort City: Unions' free beer, BBQs and phantom pay cost state millions'. The article said:PAYROLL'ghosts' - workers who don't exist - are allegedly being created by unionists to boost their coffers ...A SUB-CONTRACTOR was allegedly told to pay $1000 for each of seven days' work, then given receipts claiming the $7000 was for union T-shirts.The article also said:One of the worst hit projects is the Spencer St Station ... It is claimed the station's developers have had to pay for 23 representatives or officials - none of whom do construction work - to look after members on the site.No wonder the unions in Victoria talk about the Spencer Street redevelopment as `Treasure Island'. We could change this culture of lawlessness and intimidation if the Labor Party were prepared to support our legislation; but the reality is that they are not. Indeed, Labor senators have said, in their report on the legislation, `There was no evidence of significant criminality in the industry.' The evidence points otherwise. This government will reintroduce legislation to establish a building and construction industry commission.The reality is that the unions and the Labor Party have got their heads in the sand on this issue. I read in the weekend newspapers that the Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Combet, said, `There has not been a prosecution. They have got nothing on us.' In fact, there have been 21 prosecutions filed. Seven of those have been successful and 14 are still before the courts. There is a choice here for the Australian Labor Party: will they continue to be the puppets of the militant unions in this country or will they act in the national interest?</DOC>

 - In response to the second part of the question, the answer is obviously no. I take it that that was an attempt at a humorous aside in the House of Representatives. In relation to the first part of the question, I would say that during the course of the election campaign the Australian Labor Party criticised the government for not spending enough. I must say that I am always amused by the honourable member for Lilley, who after the election wants to criticise the government's election manifesto. During the election, the Labor Party promised to spend more.  - I am sorry. Did the member for Sydney say, `No, we didn't'? Perhaps the member for Sydney, who was complaining a moment ago that there were not enough child-care places, thinks that not more money but less money should be spent on child-care places. The member for Lalor, who promised the most profligate policy in Australian history, Medicare Gold, was not promising during the election campaign that less money should be spent on health but more money should be spent on health. The member for Jagajaga, during the election campaign, was not saying it was Labor's policy to spend less on education but to spend more on education.When one goes through all of the Labor Party campaign promises - and this was acknowledged by the member for Fraser, which is one of the reasons he went to the back bench - the Australian Labor Party went to the last election promising to spend more money than the government. So when the Australian Labor Party tells us those promises which it no longer stands for and walks away from, perhaps we will take it a bit more seriously. But it was a major reason why the member for Fraser went to the back bench, and he had some very sage advice on the weekend. I was thinking he was promising the Australian Labor Party that perhaps they should not have a down-tools until next February but seize the day before Christmas. - `Carpe diem', said the member for Fraser. It occurred to me that the member for Werriwa's leadership could be like Labor's family tax plan. It could be behind on a weekly basis but in front on an annual basis, if we are only to wait until February next year.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question and I acknowledge her interest in this area and her record working in this area. I can inform her that, since 1996, federal spending on mental health, principally through the MBS, the PBS and the Australian health care agreements, has increased from under $800 million a year to over $1.1 billion a year - that is nearly a 50 per cent increase and much of that is due to the tenacity of the former member for Adelaide, who worked so hard in this area.I can inform the House that about 15 per cent of young people experience mental health problems and, in fact, three-quarters of mental health problems become apparent before the age of 25. As announced during the election, the government will spend an additional $50 million to support GPs who are treating younger people with mental health issues. On average, one person in five will experience depression over the course of their lifetime. Again, as announced during the election, the government will spend an additional $30 million on the beyondblue initiative, which, amongst other things, will be researching the links between drug use and subsequent mental health problems. The government will renew the Better Outcomes in Mental Health Care program until 2008 and provide an additional $30 million. As part of this program, for instance, the government has recently trialled a new hotline for GPs dealing with mental health issues amongst their patients. I can inform the House that some 74 per cent of GPs say that their clinical care has been improved as a result of this initiative. You can trust the Howard government with Medicare. We do not just talk about Medicare - we invest the money necessary to make a good system even better.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I have actually had numerous people in the industry raise this with me, and every single one of them has understood something that the person who asked the question obviously does not understand - that is, the Beattie government in this area has been extremely ineffective and ought to get on with it and do something about it. In the one area where we do have some responsibility, the Port Waratah loader in Newcastle has not been able to operate at full capacity because of the decrepit state of the NSW lines. Under the Australian Rail Track Corporation's 60-year lease, we are about to start fixing that, including through an overpass in Newcastle.So where it is our responsibility, where it is our job - with waterfront reform or whatever - to show leadership, I would have thought our leadership has been second to none. In this case, I refer you to all of those industry leaders in Queensland who have beaten a path to my door and recognised fully that it really is about time that Mr Beattie - I think the Treasurer would point out that Queensland receives a windfall from the GST this year alone of around $660 million - got on with it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. I visited her electorate and I know the deep interest and concern she has for older Australians in her electorate. This government has placed unprecedented focus on the issue of population ageing and the needs of the increasing number of older Australians in our community. That is evidenced by the National strategy for an ageing Australia document, which is a whole-of-government framework for the challenges and opportunities presented by population ageing. That is why we had the Intergenerational Report, the Australia's demographic challenges paper and also why we have supported the Australian Local Government Association in an action plan for population ageing.In relation to the issue of aged care, this government set about reforming the aged care sector starting in 1997 with the new act, which relates to issues of quality, accreditation and certification. The reforms have continued in the last budget in 2004 in response to the review of pricing arrangements in residential aged care. The government invested a record $2.2 billion in residential aged care and also introduced initiatives such as the greater use of information technology, more initiatives to attract and retain an aged care work force and the introduction of e-commerce into aged care. Likewise, in the area of community aged care, older Australians are expressing a desire to remain at home and the government has invested record levels of funding in community care to ensure that that aspiration can be met. That area is also under review with reforms under way. In the area of transition care we are working closely with state and territory governments to ensure that older Australians can be supported through rehabilitation and convalescence. In the last budget we announced 2,000 extra transition places that will work with state and territory governments to ensure that older Australians' needs are met. In contrast, the Labor Party have failed to respond to their own report - the Gregory report that was commissioned on the aged care issues when they were in government. They left government with a 10,000-place shortfall. In contrast, the Howard government has seen unprecedented levels of funding. We have doubled funding in aged care, from some $3 billion to $6.7 billion today. Unprecedented levels of places have been allocated, with over 68,600 new aged care places allocated for older Australians across the country. There have been unprecedented levels of reform as this government continues to realise its vision for a world-class system of aged care that is high-quality, affordable, accessible and meets the needs and choices of older Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question. Australia's 1.2 million small businesses continue to benefit from this government's very strong economic management and we are committed to reducing red tape and providing a more flexible workplace. In delivering on these commitments of the government, last Friday I launched the ABN Lookup program. This is a free-of-charge IT program which enables small businesses to very simply and quickly enter the details of other businesses that they need to deal with. This can be downloaded free of charge, as I said, from www.business.gov.au. The ABN Lookup program means that no longer will small businesses need to manually check or recheck the ABN details of businesses that they deal with. The net result of this new program means that small businesses will save anything from an hour to several days per month in the time that they were previously taking. I would like to share with the House the reaction from small business and to demonstrate just what small business thinks of ABN Lookup. I would quote from Mike Willett, the proprietor of Gisborne Office Supplies. He says:Small business as well as large business has always had the necessity to verify ABN authenticity and in the past it has been a time consuming ordeal that has required other work to be deferred often to the evenings or weekends. This initiative has saved me in the vicinity of four hours per week which I can now spend on non-business activities.In addition, let me share with the House what the National Institute of Accountants have to say about ABN Lookup. It says:ABN Lookup provides businesses with a free, simple and quick way to verify these details by automating what was previously a time consuming and repetitive process.I would like to emphasise that this is just one of many programs being introduced by this government. I remind the House about the $50 million regulation reduction incentive fund which will provide incentives to local government and further reduce the time and red tape that small business in particular is involved with. Finally, may I say that this continues and delivers on, on behalf of this government, our commitment to reduce red tape for small business.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cunningham; she is a new member in this place. I appreciate the fact that there has been a 202 per cent increase in the number of apprentices in the electorate of Cunningham in the time this government has been in power, which in itself is a real vote of confidence in both the economic performance of this nation and the determination of local businesses to take on new apprentices - and we want to see more.The government has stated very clearly that we want to run a series of state-of-the-art centres of trades excellence around the country. There are 24 that have been announced. One of the locations that we have highlighted has been the Illawarra. I have not seen the article that you are particularly referring to, but at the end of the day I am delighted you have asked this question because it gives an opportunity to again encourage businesses around Australia to take the leadership that the government is after - leadership in the area of trade skills being gained by young Australians, leadership that I believe industry itself wants to participate in. If BlueScope Steel wants to write us a letter to express interest in this program, we would be very happy to receive it; it has until 18 February. -  - I am surprised that the Australian Labor Party wants to continually try to interrupt. I am trying to help the member for Cunningham and encourage her constituents to offer an expression of interest in this absolutely vital part of the government's skills training agenda. The member for Cunningham may care to encourage BlueScope Steel; she may care to encourage education and training providers in her electorate to be part of the discussions to come.I can promise the member for Cunningham and members from all over Australia this: the government, through me and Minister Nelson, are very keen to engage with local communities - to talk with them about their training skills needs and to encourage them to be part of the consortia to come that will establish these Australian technical colleges. I thank the member for Cunningham for that 202 per cent increase in the number of apprentices in her electorate in the last eight years. We have a lot more to do together.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question and congratulate him on the outstanding work he is doing in his electorate. He is, and has been for many years, a great supporter of the Work for the Dole project. I provide at the outset a warning to the Labor Party that this question does not provide them with any joy. What I am about to tell the House is not music to the ears of the Labor Party, because the Work for the Dole project and the Green Corps project are two projects which the government remain very committed to. We remain very committed to those projects because they have been an outstanding success, not just for people in Western Australia but for this country as a whole.It is important to note that, in Western Australia, since the inception of the Work for the Dole project there have been about 4,000 projects that benefited about 31,000 participants. In the electorate of Hasluck alone there have been 315 projects and 3,500 participants. So when we say to the Australian people that this government has brought about the lowest unemployment rate in 27 years, and when we say to this parliament and the Australian people that we remain committed to keeping people in and putting more people into the work force, this is one of the reasons why we have been so successful.The Green Corps project helps about 1,700 young Australians per year. It provides fantastic environmental outcomes for communities right across this country, and it provides about 60 per cent of the participants with a positive outcome at the end, because those people are able to find employment, education or training outcomes. So it is an opportunity today to say thank you to the member for Hasluck and to say congratulations regarding the great work that he has done. I say to the Labor Party that the Howard government remain committed to the Work for the Dole program, we remain committed to the work that we undertake in the Green Corps project, and we remain committed to young Australians and continuing to put those people back into the work force.</DOC>

 - I can confirm to the member for Richmond that during the recent election the government made a number of commitments to boost after-hours GP services. Probably the most important single commitment that we made was a $10 after-hours loading for GP services. This means that, in addition to government-supported clinics, we can actually have a private sector solution to this particular issue. But the fact is that the government has already made funding available for some 40 after-hours services. As a result of the election commitments, there will be funding for additional after-hours clinics; $200,000 will be made available for start-up grants for up to 30 clinics; recurrent support of $200,000 a year will be made available to those clinics; and up to 50 clinics a year will have support of up to $50,000 a year. We made a commitment during the election campaign to a clinic in the Tweed, and we will keep that commitment.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Braddon for his question. I know that, like many members who have large forested areas in their electorates, he is interested in the way in which those areas are managed and the impact of that, particularly with soaring temperatures, summer upon us and the prospect of bushfires. There are very real dangers associated with that. People's homes and businesses are put at risk, and there are many volunteers around Australia who risk their lives by being involved in our rural fire services and state emergency services. These volunteers are an integral part of our response; so too are the local councils, which are best placed to manage strategies and priorities. Engaging those communities and increasing involvement and awareness at a grassroots level will be critical for improving our preparedness to manage all the hazards we face - and bushfires in particular.Recently I announced a new initiative entitled Working Together to Manage Emergencies. The policy recognises the critical role of local government and the volunteers at the front line of our risk management and emergency response. We understand that local government is best placed to deal with those issues under this initiative. Over a period of four years, $33 million will be given to fund a local government security program, which will help councils develop a strategic plan for local consequence management as well as a local grants system to assist councils in developing and implementing community risk management plans consistent with the national plan. Another component of this policy is a $16 million volunteer support fund. This is to boost the recruitment base in volunteer organisations. We are determined to consult widely and to implement this initiative, which was announced during the course of the last election campaign, as quickly as possible, because it is obviously a very important program for the benefit of all our communities.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. In this place yesterday I was asked a question by a member opposite which in effect said: why won't we show leadership in the areas of failure of leadership by the state governments in the area of our ports? So today I thought it might be a good idea to work through the leadership that we are displaying in terms of boosting Australia's export performance and making it possible by providing the necessary land based infrastructure in the areas that are our responsibility.Our freight task is anticipated to double between now and 2020. Our export figures are climbing very rapidly. Indeed, at the moment there is such a demand for coal by China that in recent times no less than 2½ per cent of the world's shipping fleet has been involved in moving coal from the Hunter Valley to China alone. In fact, Australia delivers some 12 per cent of the world's total shipping task. The market for commodities at the moment being very strong, it is certainly providing us with a clear indication of what is needed in the future. I have spoken many times in here about one area where we have provided leadership, and it is an area where successive Labor governments said that not only could they not lead but that it could not be done in the Australian context: the waterfront. We have got an average movement of containers now across our five major ports of 28.2 containers per hour, when the Labor Party said we could not get above 15. I would have thought that was a pretty dramatic example of leadership.More than that, can I make this point in terms of our responsibilities. The interfacing between road, rail and ports in this nation is extraordinarily significant, and it has not been done well enough. I want to say that we are moving to fix it very quickly. If you take New South Wales alone, the Australian Rail Track Corporation has commenced a $260 million rail infrastructure program in the Hunter Valley to fix up inadequacies left behind by a state government that would not properly invest.In Victoria, you have got the improved road and rail links where, under AusLink, $110 million is being provided into the Dynon intermodal precinct and the Port of Melbourne, and $40 million is being provided for a railway line between Tottenham and Footscray to reduce congestion. In Sydney you have got $110 million to improve rail access to the Port of Botany, and in Western Australia $14 million is being provided for a new rail loop to Fremantle port, and new road access to the port, and that project is already under way. These are the measures needed, and we are providing the resources, the planning and the leadership to make them happen. But the point that ought to be noted is that the question yesterday was in relation to Queensland. The House might like to know that the one state in Australia that has refused to negotiate with the Australian Rail Track Corporation, owned by us, to allow for proper leasing arrangements, access to their ports and upgrading under AusLink is Queensland - the Beattie government. They cannot do it themselves, and they want to stand in the way of the Australian government facilitating their exports. The member for Perth ought to go back to the Queensland government instead of asking us to provide the leadership that these Labor states will not provide and talk to them about negotiating sensibly with the Australian Rail Track Corporation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Braddon for his question. I can inform the House that, when the GST was introduced, it was introduced pursuant to an agreement between the Commonwealth and the states which provided that the states got all GST revenue. The Commonwealth entered into an agreement to say that, if the GST revenue did not get up to the amount that the states would have got under the old system, the Commonwealth would make up the difference.Let me inform the House that, in the current financial year of 200405, every state will be in front of the guaranteed amount; no state will require a top-up; and, on the latest estimates, the cumulative windfall over and above the guaranteed amount which the states will receive in 200405 is $2,198 million - for one year.A government member - How much? - $2,198 million. The New South Wales government will receive from the GST, in excess of the guaranteed minimum amount, $269 million - and this is for just one year. The Victorian government will receive, over and above the guaranteed minimum amount, $360 million in 200405. And - get a load of this - the Queensland government will receive, in excess of the guaranteed minimum amount, $796 million in 200405.It was a condition of that agreement that, in return for that growth in the revenue base, the states would abolish their indirect taxes. Bed taxes have already been abolished, stamp duties on marketable securities have already been abolished, financial institutions duty has already been abolished, and we have secured the agreement of the states to abolish the bank account debits tax as from 1 July 2005. But plainly, with this windfall over and above the guaranteed amount, the states could go further in abolishing inefficient indirect taxes.We will be going to the intergovernmental council in March next year with proposals to use those revenue windfalls for the abolition of further taxes, which was always the intention of the new federal financial relations. Matters which will be considered are stamp duties on non-residential conveyances, on marketable securities, on leases, on mortgages, on credit arrangements and on cheques, bills of exchange and promissory notes. There is no need to give the states additional windfalls to keep them to the agreement that has been entered into. The states are, in this year alone, enjoying a windfall of over $2.9 billion. Right across the forward estimates they will continue to enjoy those windfalls. We, the Commonwealth, will be arguing strenuously that those revenues be used to reduce indirect state taxes.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to receive this question from the member for Jagajaga, in whose electorate there has been a 255 per cent increase in the number of new apprentices during the time she has been a member - some 1,749 people. When you factor that into the swing against her at the last election, that is about every one of them not voting for her.The Australian technical colleges are going to be centres of excellence. They will be run autonomously by their principal. They will be governed by a board led by industry. They will operate in a very similar way to existing government and non-government schools. But, to be eligible for Australian government funding, Australian technical colleges must meet the same funding requirements as all other schools. Only schools that are not for profit are eligible for Commonwealth funding. Let me be very clear: no additional fees will be charged in respect of the Australian technical colleges, and the article that she talks about makes that point.Of course, it may well be that there are in existing schools a range of fees and charges and, depending on the consortia which are brought together, some costs already there for students today. But the surprising part is the indignity from those opposite today. It was on 8 July 2003 that my esteemed colleague the minister for education wrote to Premier Carr in New South Wales and asked the Leader of the Opposition to co-sign a letter - he actually asked the Leader of the Opposition to co-sign a letter - protesting a 300 per cent increase in fees.If the member for Jagajaga's quote from the Australian Financial Review yesterday is correct - she said that, if students have to pay to attend colleges, it would aggravate the skills shortage - where was the press release when the New South Wales government cranked it up 300 per cent? Where was the press release when in Victoria fees rose by 25 per cent at TAFE? Where was the press release when in South Australia the fees went up by 50 per cent? Those opposite are on this curious mission to stop this government dealing with the urgent skills shortage in this country. They are on this curious mission to deny the workers of Australia the opportunity for their sons and their daughters to follow in their footsteps and to be well placed to lead Australia into a very, very successful and strong economic future. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for his question. The member for Maranoa, representing a significant proportion of Queensland, recognises the importance of the trading relationship that we enjoy with Japan. That trading relationship is probably one of the most significant and enduring in East Asia. Japan has long been our largest export destination. In 200304 our total trade in goods and services with Japan was worth $41.2 billion. Of that, Australia's exports to Japan were worth $23.1 billion. That covered a range of goods and services. Japan is the single most important market for the Australian resource commodity export sector, and it is our largest customer for LNG. In 200203 our resource exports to Japan were worth $14 billion. Since 1996, we have delivered almost 7.5 million tonnes of LNG per annum into that market out of the North West Shelf in Western Australia.I am delighted to inform the House - and I know the member for Maranoa will be particularly interested in this statistic - that Australia now supplies 91 per cent of Japan's imported beef, valued at over $1 billion. It is going to be about 360,000 tonnes this year. Ninety-one per cent of that market is dominated by Australian product, and that is largely due to the effort of the organisations that promote our exports into that part of the world. Goods exports to Japan rose 25 per cent in the three-quarters of the year until the September quarter this year, which is a significant increase in the exports into this most important market. But when we are contemplating these important statistics and what has been achieved, it is incumbent upon us to recognise that that strong trading relationship that we have with Japan started many decades ago. It was actually instigated over 50 years ago by Black Jack McEwen, who looked at the important rise in industrialisation in Japan. We should recognise that. I am pleased to say that this coalition government, now in its fourth term, has continued delivering Australian exporters extra access into this very important market.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling for his question. I was delighted to be able to spend some time with him at a small business forum I attended in Perth in his electorate. What we have in Western Australia, where the honourable member for Stirling is from, is a massive increase in industrial disputation under the Gallop government. In 2001, the rate of industrial disputes in Western Australia was 32 working days per thousand employees. By the end of 2003 - two years later - that rate had trebled to 97 working days lost per thousand employees. This is the highest rate of any state in Australia, and it is almost double the national average of 53. What we see is the Gallop government allowing militant unions in Western Australia to run amok. Justice Cole in his inquiry into the building and construction industry found that this was the case. He said in his report that the Western Australian construction industry is:... marred by unlawful and inappropriate conduct ... Fear intimidation and coercion are commonplace. Contractors, subcontractors, and workers face this culture continuously.What we see under the Gallop government and its so-called reforms of industrial relations is a clear failure for the workers and employers in that state. As a result of that, workers and employers are voting with their feet and fleeing from the state system to the federal system. In Western Australia we have seen a massive 277 per cent growth in Australian workplace agreements between 200102 and 200203. Indeed, over 100,000 Australian workplace agreements have been lodged in Western Australia in just the last two years. That is workers in Western Australia fleeing from the state industrial system, and the militancy which is allowed there, into the federal system.This impressive movement to the federal system shows how regressive the current Western Australian scheme is. This lack of control of militant unions is a threat to the Western Australian economy. It is a particular threat where we see the massive growth in AWAs in the resources sector. This sector contributes something like one-quarter of the total gross product of the state of Western Australia. The mineral and petroleum industries contribute to almost one in five jobs in Western Australia and make up 80 per cent of the state's exports. This is the sector which is most in jeopardy from the regressive workplace relations system in Western Australia. I call upon the Western Australian state government to abandon this regressive system and adopt the much more progressive system of the Howard government.</DOC>

 - I thank the new member for Wakefield for his question and I congratulate him on his rather splendid arrival in this House. I can tell the House that since 1990 childhood immunisation rates have increased from about 50 per cent to over 90 per cent. Government spending on vaccination has increased from just $13 million in 1996 to $254 million in the current financial year.From 1 January all newborns will be eligible for pneumococcal vaccination and there will be a catch-up program for children born after 1 January 2003. In 2002 invasive pneumococcal disease affected some 761 Australian children, with nine deaths. That is what the government's program is designed to combat. The Chief Medical Officer has already written to parents reminding them of the catch-up program. This week GPs have been alerted to the start of the pneumococcal vaccination program. The parents of newborns should receive information about pneumococcal vaccination before their babies leave hospital, during home visits from community health care nurses and at their children's first check-up.The government is determined to ensure that there is a wide take-up of this important new vaccination program. This government does not just talk about Medicare; it invests the money that is necessary to make a good health system even better.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for his question. I think this is the first question I have taken from the member for Bass. I very warmly welcome him to the House. I must say that the member for Bass and I shared one of the more memorable moments of the election campaign at the Albert Hall in Launceston.I want to remark very briefly on a memorable moment for democracy around the world and that is the other election that was held on 9 October, the one that was held in Afghanistan and led to the election of President Karzai. It is the first time there has been a democratically installed government in Afghanistan. It is something that we very warmly welcome. It has been a long and hard march for the people of Afghanistan, and the men and women of the Australian Defence Force played a major role in the liberation of that country and the expulsion from government of the brutal dictatorship of the Taliban.I want to wish President Karzai well as he faces the very difficult work of reconstructing his country, healing ethnic divisions and developing the democratic culture and system in Afghanistan. Australia should be proud of the role that we have played. Not only did we contribute military forces alongside our allies to respond to the attacks in September 2001 but, since that date, we have offered assistance to Afghanistan of some $110 billion. Democracy has not been a way of life in that country and it is therefore treasured all the more by the people of Afghanistan. We wish them well. We share their moment of legitimate satisfaction and joy that democracy has finally come and we continue to assure them of our support as they tread the path of democracy and partnership with the rest of the world. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McMillan and I say on behalf of the House that it is great to see him back. Today Westpac released the consumer sentiment figures for the month of December. Whilst consumer sentiment fell by 2.9 per cent, it is up 4.4 per cent over the year and 17.1 per cent above its long run average, indicating that consumers are very confident in Australia at the moment - and why wouldn't they be? Unemployment is at its lowest level in 27 years. Household wages have been growing strongly, consumer prices remain subdued and interest rates are at historic lows with the home mortgage variable interest rate at about 7.05 per cent.In addition to that, housing finance figures were released today showing that the value of housing finance in October fell by 3.1 per cent. This was led by a decline in investor finance, which was down 8.1 per cent for the month and down 32 per cent over the year. We have seen quite a substantial drop in investor finance and a moderate drop in relation to owner occupied finance, which is down 7.8 per cent over the year. For about the last two years I have been indicating that you should not expect the housing market to continue increasing at the rate that it was and, what is more, if it did continue increasing at that rate, that would be unsustainable. So to see a slowing in relation to housing finance - particularly a slowing in relation to investor finance - is something that the government has been looking for. It is not unwelcome. It indicates that there is a slow down in that sector, which is confirmed by approvals and by other indicators such as auction clearance rates, and it shows that one of the hotspots of the economy - which we have been warning about for some time - is now coming off in an orderly and measured way, which will provide some durability in the sector over the medium term.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question and for her interest. Honourable members will recall the bombing of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta on 9 September and the tragic consequences that flowed from that bombing. But one of the lessons we learned was the effectiveness of the blast proofing of the windows of the Australian embassy. As a result of that bombing, the government decided immediately to blast-proof windows at all our overseas missions - at a cost, I might say of $83 million. Although it is a lot of money, it is money worth spending. We have also been conducting an assessment of the security measures that we already have in place at our overseas missions. As a result of this, the government have now approved an additional $590 million for a new substantial package of security measures, which will commence this financial year, focusing of course on our higher threat posts. We aim to have in place new minimum and enhanced standards at all our posts.The attack on the US Consulate in Jeddah over the last couple of days simply illustrates the importance of having good perimeter security and also hardened walls. New purpose-built chancelleries are being designed to withstand bomb blasts, with hardened walls which will provide a level of protection against assault. These initiatives build on the priority work that DFAT, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, has undertaken in the last two years, spending an additional $100 million. This demonstrates the importance the government attach to ensuring the security of people who visit, as well as work in our missions overseas. This $590 million package which we have announced today will include repair work at the embassy in Jakarta, following the 9 September bombing. The package itself will be implemented over a period of five years. In this age of terrorism we just cannot be too careful in providing protection for our diplomats and officials, as well as visitors to our missions overseas. We think it is wise to spend the additional money over a five-year period, and that should give much greater confidence to officers of the Australian government who are serving overseas.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and for his ongoing interest in the importance of increasing Australia's export effort into the markets of not just East Asia but South Asia as well. It is well known that Australian merchandise exports to India are increasing at a steady rate. In fact, we now export $4.8 billion worth of merchandise to India. India is now our seventh largest merchandise export market and one that we pay particular attention to. There has been an 88 per cent increase in our merchandise exports to India in the last year. In fact, in the last decade there has been a 400 per cent increase in those merchandise exports, led by exports of gold, copper ores, coal and wool. With two-way trade now standing at $5.8 billion, India is a significant bilateral trading partner. The potential exists, given the size of the population of India, for significant growth in the commercial relationship between Australia and India. India's growing prosperity is attracting a surge in Australia's services exports. So it is not just commodities; it is also services that are growing. Australia is the third largest supplier of education services to the Indian market. Over 13,000 Indian students trained and received education in Australia last year. That is a 32 per cent increase in the services sector since 2002.India is also Australia's eighth largest overseas investor. In the last year we have invested over $1 billion into the Indian economy. Yesterday BlueScope Steel announced that it would invest $100 million to construct three new manufacturing facilities in India to service the growing building and construction industry. As these statistics demonstrate, Australia's trade and investment relationship with India is growing at a good rate. At the recent meeting in Vientiane, the Prime Minister held a very productive meeting with India's Prime Minister Singh, talking about the prospects of enhancing the already strong economic relationship between Australia and India. In the coming months the government will be exploring the most effective way to further strengthen that trade and investment relationship that exists between our two countries.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question and his interest in family matters - and I congratulate him on his engagement, which occurred not so long ago - and, no doubt, his future interest in the maternity payment. Can I say that the government introduced in this year's budget a $600 per child payment, which is available to those families which are eligible for family tax benefit part A. Before 30 June, 2.1 million Australians were able to share in that payment. In relation to reconciliation of tax returns, for the year ended 30 June you were eligible for another $600. I can inform the House that 1.6 million Australians have now reconciled their 30 June tax return and entitlement and, accordingly, are eligible for that $600 payment. That is of real assistance to families that are struggling and need help with raising the children. Are there any other alternatives? The Labor Party maintains that this $600 does not exist. Wayne Swan told the AM program on 2 September 2004, `That $600 is not ongoing.' Try telling that to 1.6 million Australians who have now qualified. He told the John Faine program on 6 September, `That $600 is not continuing.' Well, try telling that to the 1.6 million Australians who have now put in their reconciliation. The Leader of the Opposition told listeners at his policy launch on 7 September, `That $600 supplement is not real.' That is funny - it goes into bank accounts, it comes out of bank accounts, it buys goods and services at the cash register, it cost the government $2.2 billion, but it is not real. Is it any wonder that Labor lost the campaign because it had no economic credibility? One of the first steps in the long march - and I am sure members of the Labor Party would be familiar with the long march - to economic credibility would be to recognise that when you pay people $600 the money is real.Can I just say that apparently the Labor Party policy is still to abolish the $600. The Labor Party policy still does not acknowledge that $600. There are some voices of economic reason now clamouring for a change of policy but, unhappily, they do not include the member for Lilley. They include his factional opponent the member for Lalor, done in for the shadow treasurership but far more responsible. She told the Age newspaper on 1 November 2004 -  - It is true: she is far more responsible than the members of the rooster brigade that did her over. She told the Age on 1 November 2004:In some of our traditional booths we saw swings against us ... I think probably the $600 played a role in that.Listen to this:I think we've got to be frank and say there were a lot of people who received $1200 or $1800 ... in a lump sum and they were pretty keen to keep it, and they identified needing to vote for the Howard Government as the way of keeping it.Well, they were right about that. She was right about that. Her economic credibility - notwithstanding Medicare Gold, a subject we will return to in due course - in relation to that $600 is better than any rooster that crowed over her damaged body in relation to the shadow treasurership. Until the Labor Party can come to grips with itself and until we find that the member for Lilley can come out and acknowledge that when you pay $600 it actually exists, that long march to credibility will not have begun, Labor will not be ready to rehabilitate itself, and people will have to continue voting for the Howard government to get their $600 entitlement.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Tangney for his question and welcome him to the House. As he knows, almost 600,000 Australian workplace agreements have been approved since 1997. They have now become an integral part of the workplace in Australia. - I say to the member for Brisbane and others opposite that they are here to stay. Workers in Australia have voted with their feet and entered into Australian workplace agreements. The member for Perth has recently raised the possibility of the ALP reviewing its policy. He said about Australian workplace agreements:... the AWA issue is an issue that parts of business are very hot to trot on, so that forms part of the policy review.It seems that the member for Perth has finally conceded that his party's opposition to AWAs is in fact anti business. Maybe he has been spending some more time in his electorate. If he goes to his electorate, he will find that currently there are 4,127 existing AWAs in operation in his electorate. If he goes nearby to the electorate of the member for Fremantle, he will find 6,007 of them. If he goes further afield, to the member for Cowan's electorate, he will find 8,264 AWAs in operation. When the member for Perth was saying, `We're going to review this policy,' presumably he wanted to be a little more pro business.But overnight he got a different message. In fact, what the Labor unions told the member for Perth overnight was to take a Bex and lie down. We had Doug Cameron out overnight. I understand Mr Cameron is around the House today, no doubt knocking on the door of the member for Perth. Yesterday he threatened the Labor caucus if it changed its policy. He said: `Unions are as one in opposing Australian workplace agreements.' No wonder the member for Perth was out doing a doorstop, flip-flopping, this morning. He said this:I'm under no illusions about the very strong view that is held by the union movement about this issue.He went on:Our starting point is clear, our policy is unaltered ...The member for Perth having said recently, `We're going to review all this, and we're going to be friendly to business,' Dougie Cameron comes out and says, `Don't you dare do that.' And the member for Perth was out doing a doorstop this morning saying, `Our policy is unaltered.' That is the reality: it is a Clayton's review of policy, because the Leader of the Opposition predetermined the position on 20 November, when he said:... we don't see the need for the AWA's, our policy is unaltered.Of course it is unaltered. It will remained unaltered until there is fundamental reform of the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forrest for his question. Obviously, the government accepts that older people do face higher health care costs than the rest of the community. This is why the government provides concession card holders - which includes most people over 65 - with access to the Medicare safety net at a lower threshold. This is why the government is proposing to increase the private health insurance rebate for people over 65.When it comes to the health budget, the Howard government understands that there is no magic pudding. The Howard government understands that governments cannot spend less and actually get more. Unlike this government, the member for Lalor was at it again this morning, peddling the Whitlamite fantasy known as Medicare Gold. She may be more responsible than the roosters - but not much more responsible than the roosters. In the paper this morning she referred to Medicare Gold's extraordinary `electoral potency'. If Medicare Gold was so electorally attractive, why didn't more electors actually vote for it?If the Labor Party lost the election despite Medicare Gold, what does that say about the electability of Mr Twenty-five Per Cent sitting in the chair opposite, whom frontbenchers are now describing as the Doc Evatt impostor roaming around the Labor Party caucus. Medicare Gold is a dud, and members opposite know it. The member for Melbourne has said that Medicare Gold destroyed Labor's economic credibility. The chief of staff of the member for Brand has said it was a strategic disaster. The incoming President of the Labor Party has called Medicare Gold a turkey. The intellectual-in-chief, Mr Botsman, has said that Medicare Gold was a cross between a donkey and a wombat. It is certainly a wonky, shonky policy.The Labor Party's arguments over Medicare Gold are really just a proxy fight over the leadership of the Labor Party. Let me make this prediction: Medicare Gold will not outlive the Leader of the Opposition by one day. Mr Speaker, let me make this very clear: there will be no fool's gold from the Howard government; there will be no Medicare magic pudding put forward by the Howard government. What there will be is sensible investment in making a good health system even better.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for his question. He is the first member of the federal parliament from the electorate of Bonner which was named in honour of the great Australian and former Liberal Senator, the late Neville Bonner. Last night in this parliament, historic schools legislation was passed that will deliver not only $33 billion to schools over the next four years but, for the first time, will demand that there will be a common starting age for schooling right across Australia; there will be national standards in schooling; plain language reports to parents about the progress of their children; the national values framework for schooling will be adopted and displayed in Australian schools; there will be available to parents and prospective parents of schools the real performance of a school at a local level; literacy and numeracy testing benchmarks will be reported to Australian parents right across Australia; and, of course, school principals - which might seem unremarkable to many here - will have a say over who actually teaches in the school for which they are responsible.In relation to the schools policy, on 1 December last week the Courier-Mail reported on Labor's schools policy and said:But despite trying to convince Australians it was learning from the past, the Opposition has endorsed the controversial `hit list' of private schools that would be stripped of public funding under a future Labor Government.So the hit list of private schools was endorsed. In fact, the story said:A caucus spokeswoman denied the decision meant Labor would again take a hit list of private schools to the next election.I thought, right, they are not going to take a hit list to the next election, but they have endorsed the hit list! That is the sort of stuff that inspires John Cleese. The story went to say:But she admitted `there will be redistribution', meaning some schools would lose funding.The reality is that the Labor Party we now know has endorsed its schools policy. The Prime Minister said during the election campaign that hit lists never shrink, they only grow. Labor's hit list initially proposed to slash the funding to support the education of 160,000 Australian children in 178 schools. I heard some Labor people saying, `The Prime Minister's going to say that sort of thing; that the hit list would only grow.' In fact, the Prime Minister and people on this side have actually read Labor's policy and many Labor caucus people have not. You need to go to the footnote on page 17. Labor's policy of course says that once you hit the hit list threshold of funding - above and beyond which Labor says, `Parents should not be paying any more for the education of their children; stop making sacrifices; we in Labor want to punish you' - it says on page 17 at footnote 2: `This funding will be indexed against a weighted average of wage cost index and CPI.' The average person would think: what does that mean?In plain language, it means that under this government funding to support the education of the one million kids in Catholic and independent schools increases each year by around six or seven per cent. Under Labor, it would increase by three per cent. On 16 September, at the Catholic education forum in Brisbane that I also addressed, in answer to a question from the Catholic Education Office the Deputy Leader of the Opposition admitted that over a six-year period the Labor Party's policy would take not 178 schools, but every one of those 2,650 schools onto Labor's hit list. The reality is that the Labor Party has a vendetta, particularly led by the Leader of the Opposition, against parents who make sacrifices for the education of their children. Under the current Leader of the Opposition, `ALP' means `Against Learning Privately'. I can assure you, Mr Speaker, under this government's literacy programs by 2007 every Australian child, every one of those 1.1 million children in Catholic and independent schools and their parents, will be able to read Labor's hit list and will understand that every child in the system is vulnerable if the Labor Party ever comes to government. </DOC>

 - There is no contradiction here. I did not issue the press release from my office. However, can I say that, with regard to this project, I believed at the time that the project had been announced. I would just like to take you back for a moment to the points that I have made about Horse Australia. The CEO of Horse Australia was advised on 31 August. Mrs Clelland confirms that she was told of the grant on 31 August. I believed the project had been announced, although the press release was not issued by me. If my office does not issue the press release, it is generally forwarded to the relevant member or senator. It is generally the case that recipients of grants and the senator or member concerned liaise on a suitable date, time and venue for an announcement. This is usually done within a matter of days and certainly never more than within a few weeks of the confirmation of the grant.I assumed, not unreasonably, that such a good project would have been announced long ago. This was a misunderstanding, and I apologised to the House for it yesterday. But I will just go on to say why this is such a good project. This does not come from those who administer Regional Partnerships; it comes from the people of Capricornia. I would like to quote from the editorial of yesterday's Morning Bulletin:Horse Australia promises to be a national and perhaps even international success when it kicks off in March 2005.Hear, hear to that! However, it went on to say:An outside observer could be forgiven for thinking the member for Capricornia, Kirsten Livermore, wasn't our representative at all. Yesterday in federal parliament Mrs Livermore decided to score some political points against her coalition counterparts ... - Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I said, this project was warmly welcomed by the people of Capricornia. The editorial continued:She put at risk some $200,000 for an inaugural Central Queensland event. Instead of taking the funding and double-checking with Ms Kelly's office about the timing of the letter, Ms Livermore has opted to create a political furore. - The editor went on to say:We would suggest that in the interest of her electorate she adopt the take the money and run attitude and leave the political point scoring for a more serious offence.</DOC>

 - This is the last sitting day and the last question time for the parliament this year, and I am delighted to inform the House that Australia's unemployment rate has now fallen to 5.2 per cent. This is what public policy is about. It is not about wasting the time of parliament on pointless, insubstantial nitpicking; it is about creating real jobs for real Australians. That has been the objective of our government, and I am proud of the fact that our government have presided over what is now a 27- to 30-year low in the level of unemployment in Australia. In the government's first term of office, we created 370,000 new jobs. In the second term, we created 430,000 new jobs. In the third term, we created 635,000 new jobs.Not only did we create, over those three terms, almost 1.5 million new jobs in this country, but we have also presided over increases in real wages of more than 12 per cent in the time that we have been in government. This is about 10 times greater than the real wage increases that occurred in the 13½ years of the Hawke and Keating governments.All of this is unconditional good news for the people of Australia. However, it could be even better if the Labor Party would get out of the way: they still have an opportunity this afternoon. If the Labor Party in the Senate were to change their position on the unfair dismissal laws this afternoon, we could send the still-unemployed of Australia a wonderful Christmas present by removing the barriers to further employment in small business by reforming the outrageous unfair dismissal laws of this country. But no: Scrooge-like and insensitive to the needs of the unemployed in Australia, Labor will go to Christmas clinging to their outdated, union dominated hostility to the reform of our unfair dismissal laws.We can have a '4' in front of our unemployment figure. We could have had it earlier, but the people who have stood in the way of still-lower unemployment are the members of the Australian Labor Party. They should go to Christmas realising that not only has this government delivered low unemployment and high real wages but they, the members of the Australian Labor Party, are stopping the creation of even lower levels of unemployment in this country.I want to thank the businesses of Australia and the employees of Australia for the contribution they have made towards delivering this wonderful Christmas present for the unemployed of our nation.</DOC>

 - There were no letters for Regional Partnerships signed by me after I became Minister for Veterans' Affairs. The letters involved in this - and I refer the House to the statements made by me and the departmental liaison officer - relate to three packages of Regional Partnerships projects. One project was Horse Australia, and I approved another two packages of projects in October, signed off on the projects and signed the relevant letters to stakeholders. As we explained before, all of this was then handed back to the department. As the departmental liaison officer has made clear, he posted those at a later date and date-stamped them. That date was after I became the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, but I signed all projects and all correspondence before I was sworn in as Minister for Veterans' Affairs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for the interesting question. I am pleased to inform the House that I did meet the members of the newly appointed National Indigenous Council this morning. This body is chaired by the highly respected magistrate from Western Australia Mrs Sue Gordon. It is a council that includes a wide range of representatives of the Indigenous people. It has a very good mix of people from different parts of the country and from different age groups. It includes people of a variety of views not only on Indigenous policy; it includes, as the House will know, a federal Vice-President of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Warren Mundine. I particularly welcome his very constructive involvement with this body.I was particularly impressed with the great sense of hope and optimism that this council brings to the very daunting challenges in the area of Indigenous policy. I do not think there is any doubt that there have been signs of something of a sea change in the attitudes of people towards the way forward in relation to Indigenous policy, and the involvement of the people on this council is a very, very encouraging sign indeed. I made it very plain to the members of the council that they would comprise the principal source of advice to the government on Indigenous issues. That does not mean that the government will not from time to time talk to other bodies and other people, but this body will be the principal source of advice to the government.Both yesterday and today, the council had meetings with some five or six ministers in the government as well as the secretary of my own department and the heads of other government agencies, and all the members of the council have expressed their great satisfaction with the level of involvement of ministers and senior officials. In our discussions we did talk about the importance of the reciprocity that underpins both the government's concept of shared responsibility agreements and traditional Aboriginal culture. The negotiation at a local level of shared responsibility agreements is an important element of our approach to Indigenous policy.I was particularly encouraged by the reference by many members of the council to the need in future to base Aboriginal policy on the development of a more entrepreneurial culture. One or two of the members in particular raised the desirability of moving towards embracing concepts of private landownership as an advance on the concept of everything being owned by the community and not enough encouragement being given to individuals and families to own their own properties. I indicated that the government would respond in a generally positive way to that point of view, and it does represent a major step forward and a break from past attitudes which I think have acted as a brake on progress and solutions.I note that this morning there was some discussion about aspects of the shared responsibility approach and, in particular, there were some comments being made about an agreement with the community of Mulan. In that connection, I particularly welcome the approach being taken by John Kobelke, the Western Australian Minister for Indigenous Affairs. He very strongly supports the approach that has been taken by the community. His views are very much in line with the approach taken by the government and, in that sense, reject the rather negative and old-fashioned views on this subject that have been expressed by Senator Kim Carr, speaking on behalf of the Australian Labor Party in this parliament.</DOC>

 - I have answered this question, but for the edification of the opposition I will answer it again. I refer to the statement by the departmental liaison officer. I signed a further batch of applications, following the Horse Australia one, on 31 August. -  - I signed a further batch of applications which were dealt with on 20 and 22 October. Those applications, letters and so on were of course passed to the department and, as the departmental liaison officer has said, he made arrangements for the changeover. He had the letters with him -  - and he date-stamped them and sent them out afterwards. But I will just say something, Mr Speaker: all of this debate this week has been about diverting from the problems of the opposition. -  - This is an attempt to smear a program that has helped Australians right across this nation. This is an attempt to smear a hardworking government. Let me tell you some of the projects that you would never have supported: the Tasmanian choral festival; the Ngaanyatjarra lands, to give them a media and telecommunications hub; a focal point for community groups and organisations in Wangaratta; and the Ti-Tree rural transaction centre outside Tennant Creek, to enable Indigenous people and others to have access to Centrelink, motor registration, the post office and visiting professionals. These are the sorts of projects you are trying to smear. - Another project is a Four Post Youth Camp to help disadvantaged youth. These are the sorts of projects you are trying to smear. Another is the Shellharbour City No Dole Program, to employ a coordinator to help young people get a pathway to work. You are a disgrace! - Yes, Mr Speaker, I was. - Yes, it is.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fisher for his question. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reports that retail sales have fallen by around one per cent since June. But according to the Australian Retailers Association, it is expecting a big build-up to Christmas this year with sales increasing by seven per cent in New South Wales, up to $11.5 billion. In Victoria retailers are expecting consumers to spend a record $8 billion on Christmas gifts, which is an increase of seven per cent. So that looks like a strong Christmas retail sales period. - As the member for Grayndler interjects, I have advised people to carefully consider credit card debt over Christmas and to be sure they do not overcommit themselves, because bills come around in February. - As the member for Grayndler reminds me, that message was carried under the headline 'All you need is love', which was not an original statement by me. It was a statement by a man called Lennon, although not the Lenin that the member for Grayndler is familiar with - it was a John Lennon rather than a Vladimir Ilich Lenin.In the lead-up to Christmas I know that many members will be looking for purchases for children and many of them would like to read books to children. Some members think that is the biggest political issue of the day - or at least they did 12 months ago - so I thought I might have some recommendations as to what children's books could be bought to read to children over Christmas. The first one I came up with was a book by Tessa Krailing called The Rude Parrot. According to the blurb:Fussy, obnoxious Great-aunt Cynthia - who hates pets - shows up just as Sam begins to pet-sit for a talking parrot who shouts insults ... -  - I am asked about retail sales and my attitude to retail purchases, and there is one other children's book which I would recommend, written by Wendy Lewison, called The Rooster Who Lost His Crow:A rooster lost his crow and didn't know what to do. Rooster and the other farm animals looked all over for it. They looked in the grass ... [the] cage, the shed ... [and] in rooster's mouth ... but they couldn't find it. The rooster learned a lesson ... never stop trying.So I hope that it is a happy Christmas, that those who read children's books will find some entertainment in those books and that we will have a good retailing season this Christmas.</DOC>

 - Mr Crooke was appointed on a short-term basis for four months as an assistant adviser, to replace a person holding that position in my office who resigned to contest a Senate seat in New South Wales. As it was a short-term appointment, I gave him permission to retain the directorship of his one-person consultancy, in accordance with the guidelines, on the understanding that there would be no work that interfered with his duties in my office or provided conflict of interest.I would like to go to the question of his company. Mr Crooke has advised me that his company employs no outside staff. His wife is the company secretary and receives a small annual fee. It does not hold any shares in any other company. Mr Crooke holds two ordinary shares in his company, his wife has one share, and each of his children holds a share. Neither Mr Crooke and his wife nor any other member of his family holds or has ever held shares in the company A2 Dairy Marketers or any other company or entity associated with that company. As per my statement to the House, I informed the House that Mr Crooke was required to ensure that he had no conflict of interest. In fact, as you would read from his statement, he immediately cancelled his consultancy with A2 milk. - Yesterday the complaint was that I did not answer questions. I would like to have the courtesy of being able to make a response, if I may. As per Mr Crooke's statement, he had cancelled his consultancy, and A2 dairy milk appointed another government relations consultant in his place. He advised me he had removed that conflict of interest. - I usually do not take questions from across the floor but, regarding the meeting with the Queensland minister, Mr Crooke did not advise me of that meeting. If you refer to his statement of interest, he had arranged that meeting as a courtesy. He attended it. It was meant to be held before he took employment with me. The meeting was deferred. He went as a courtesy with, according to his statement, the other consultants. - I think that has covered the question that was asked.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question. I know that she has asked several questions about Iraq over the course of this year, 2004, and I appreciate her interest. I am delighted to answer this question before a delegation from Iraq - people who are enormously welcome here in Australia. We are delighted to have them and we are delighted to have helped them to achieve freedom as well. We are proud of the role we played to help you.Let me make a couple of points about this. First of all, we want to see elections in Iraq on 30 January. We will do everything we can to contribute to those elections taking place. The free people of Iraq should be entitled to vote. Despite the efforts of terrorists to stop them voting, I know there is enormous determination in the international community to ensure they can vote. We are assisting with the electoral process. We committed $5 million through the United Nations in support of that process and $1 million for governance initiatives. Indeed, members may be interested to know that two Iraqi electoral officials observed our own Australian federal election in October. - Yes, I believe they thought it was a very good election. I do not doubt they were very happy with the result as well, let's face it, since this was, after all, an issue during the election. It is also worth noting that the Australian Defence Force is equipping a Fijian deployment to protect United Nations personnel supporting the Iraqi election process. We are happy to be providing that assistance as well.Let me conclude by saying that this is one of many questions I have been asked about this issue of Iraq, our troops in Iraq and our contribution to Iraq throughout this year. In this last question time of the year it is worth reflecting that, throughout this year - or not throughout this year; from 23 March onwards - there has been an alternative view on this question. That alternative view is the Leader of the Opposition's notorious 'troops out by Christmas' policy - a policy not endorsed by the shadow cabinet when it was announced, not supported by many people in the Australian Labor Party, and which the Australian public rejected. Whatever the public thought about the original role we played in throwing out Saddam Hussein, they knew that we should not cut and run.The Labor Party spokesman on defence, the member for Barton, said in an interview on Monday that he and Kevin Rudd are going to spend their Christmas having a series of discussions with Iraqi representatives here as well as with United States and United Nations representatives. We have had 10 policies since 23 March from the Labor Party on 'troops out by Christmas'. Despite our offers of briefing, which have never been taken up, we are now told that after Christmas there will be an 11th policy. An 11th policy will be produced. What is Labor's 11th policy going to be? It will not be 'troops out by Christmas'. All we know of Labor's position now is that they will work out their position over Christmas. It is going to be very interesting to watch.We do know that the Labor Party made a catastrophic mistake with their policy this year. If they had had briefing from us, listened to what we had to say and learned a bit from people who know something about this issue then Labor could have been part of helping the free people of Iraq. We are proud of the role we have played. We did a great thing last year and a great thing this year in helping the people of Iraq. The House can rest assured that, in 2005, we will continue to do so.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, as you are the next-door neighbour of the member for Mallee, I am sure you are also interested in the answer to this question, given that both your electorates, and particularly the electorate of Mallee, earn hundreds of millions of dollars in export earnings for Australia and create many thousands of jobs in that part of Australia. During the course of this year Australia has been instrumental in securing an historic agreement to eliminate global agricultural export subsidies. By stealing our export markets and reducing international prices, export subsidisers for decades have severely damaged Australian farm exports, including dairy, beef, sugar and wheat. While I am on the subject of wheat, I would also like to join my colleagues in recognising the delegation from the Iraqi Grains Board who are visiting Australia at the moment. I welcome them to our country and wish them all the best during their stay in Australia.Analysis shows that ridding the world of export subsidies would increase Australian dairy exports by more than $600 million. Ridding the world of export subsidies would increase Australian sugar exports immediately by $40 million. As chair of the Cairns Group, we are determined to open up new farm export markets in the current round of global trade negotiations. An ambitious outcome would create important new export opportunities and jobs - more jobs, as our government has been committed to over the last eight years - in Australia, particularly in the Australian farm sector. The World Bank has estimated that the global economy stands to gain $600 billion from a successful round in the WTO. It is important, vital and incumbent upon the major subsidisers - the European Union, the United States and Japan - to stand up to the protectionist forces within their democracies, within their countries, and play a leadership role. An ambitious outcome on agriculture in the Doha Round is Australia's No. 1 trade policy priority, and Australia will continue to fight every step of the way to ensure that our farmers can compete better globally and continue to generate more employment opportunities in regional Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. To the best of my knowledge, that is not the advice provided by the department at the time. I understand they did seek assurances from the then parliamentary secretary that the matter of any conflict of interest had been resolved, and those assurances were provided, as they have been provided in this place and as they were provided indeed to her at the time. Let me take the opportunity to say that this whole exercise by the Australian Labor Party has clearly demonstrated to regional Australia the disdain in which regional Australia is held by the Labor Party. They hold almost no seats in rural and regional Australia, and even with those few that they do hold -  -  - such as that of the member for Capricornia, they are more interested, when they come to Canberra, in serving the political purposes of the federal ALP in this place than they are in looking after their local constituents.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question. I must say, in the very brief period he has been here, I have been impressed with the interest he has taken in Papua New Guinea. -  - Well, nobody from the opposition, to the best of my knowledge, has ever asked me a question about Papua New Guinea, yet it is our nearest neighbour. In 8½ years I do not think I have ever been asked a question about Papua New Guinea. Maybe I am doing the opposition an injustice, but I doubt it. I will be leading a delegation of seven Australian ministers to the Australia-Papua New Guinea Ministerial Forum next week, which will take place in Lae. This is a very propitious time to be leading this delegation because this has been the second year in a row of growth for the Papua New Guinea economy and there have been signs of recent improvement in economic management. I think many members know that Papua New Guinea faces serious long-term development challenges: law and order, problems with corruption, poor governance, and so on. The House would be aware that it was just 12 months ago, almost to the day, in the Adelaide Hills, at Mount Lofty, that our government agreed with the Papua New Guinea government to what is called the Enhanced Cooperation Program.Under this program we will be deploying 210 Australian police and 64 senior officials and judges to Papua New Guinea in order to assist the Papua New Guinea government to meet its challenges. Already 64 police have arrived and 32 officials have been deployed. Joint police patrols began on the streets of Port Moresby on 2 December. So this ministerial forum comes at a good time. It is an opportunity for us to take stock of how the Enhanced Cooperation Program is working. This, of course, is an example of the activism of the government in international relations, including in the South Pacific, and making sure that instead of just a policy of benign neglect we have a policy of very real activism to help Papua New Guinea and other countries in the region achieve serious reform, overcome the problems of poverty and deprivation, deal with issues like HIV-AIDS and provide overall a more secure, a more satisfactory and a more prosperous region.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson for the question, because yesterday a suite of legislation that enables counter-terrorism arrangements to remain responsive passed this House and the Senate. It is a response to the ever-changing global security environment in which we are operating. I want to acknowledge the importance of the parliament's ensuring the passage of these bills. It enabled us to deliver on an election commitment to reintroduce this important legislation, which regrettably was unable to be dealt with before the parliament was dissolved. I note that there were a number of inquiries that ensured that that happened.The effect of the bills, once royal assent is achieved, is as follows. First, they allow law enforcement officers greater use of surveillance devices to ensure they can keep ahead of the increasingly sophisticated technology used by terrorists and criminals. The legislation also provides police with easier access to stored communications such as text messages and email. One bill protects sensitive national security information in criminal proceedings to ensure that we do not identify people who may provide advice and whose lives could be at risk or identify systems that we use that are important in collecting intelligence information, and to ensure that we still have access to intelligence information from abroad which might be jeopardised if it were to be used in public. But we do not want to see a situation where prosecutions do not proceed because of those difficulties.Finally, ASIO has been enabled to carry out security assessments in relation to a wider range of activities involving ammonium nitrate. That product is a common fertiliser and is used in the mining industry as well, but it was also used with devastating consequences in Oklahoma and is known to be a product of choice for bomb-making in our own region by Jemaah Islamiah.Only two months has elapsed since the election. The government made it clear that it had the intention of getting on with the job of protecting and securing the Australian community, and we have been able to do so with the passage of this legislation. I am grateful for the support that has been received for that. I cannot guarantee a terrorist attack will not occur in Australia. Some people have said it is inevitable. I have never used those words, but we need to do everything in our power to ensure that we protect Australians and the Australian community and to prevent a terrorist act from occurring here. That is why I always place a sense of urgency on every bill that has national security implications. I regard our counter-terrorism arrangements as an unfinished canvas, one we need to continually refine and adapt if we are to meet the needs of protecting Australians.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I would like to deal with the question that was put before, about Mr Palaszczuk. The independent assessment of the project prepared by the department includes advice of letters of support. I will read from that:Letters of support have been received from 40 farmers willing to supply another process that would increase farmgate. Support is identified from the Hon. Henry Palaszczuk.As I have said, Mr Crooke was appointed on a short-term basis for some four months to replace an assistant adviser. Mr Crooke is a hardworking and decent man who stepped in at very short notice when a staff member left. This is an attempt to smear the program and smear a good man, whom I directed to remove any conflicts of interest. He responded, as per his statement, by severing his commercial relationship with A2 Milk. - Because Mr Crooke was taken on for a very short period of contract, he did not provide a written statement of private interests. - Yes. - Yes, very confidential.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. I know how concerned he is to see agreements like this go ahead and to see more agreements like this go ahead. The social fabric of this nation will be built up by dozens and, ultimately, hundreds and thousands of agreements like this. That is how you build a stronger country - not by the kind of nitpicking that we have seen from members opposite today, alleging impropriety on the basis of no substantial evidence. Under this proposed agreement, the government will provide funding to enable fuel bowsers to be established in the Mulan community. Also under this agreement, local Indigenous people have undertaken to clean their community up, to ensure that kids go to school and take the actions necessary to tackle the scourge of trachoma, which now afflicts their communities.This agreement is a practical demonstration of Noel Pearson's dictum that Indigenous people will only advance if they are allowed to take responsibility for their own lives. The Leader of the Opposition was actually asked about this very agreement on ABC radio this morning and he said that shared responsibility was a Labor Party invention. He said mutual responsibility is 'a longstanding Labor principle'. It might be that, but he has not told Senator Kim Carr, because Senator Kim Carr was on ABC radio just a few minutes later saying that the agreement was patronising, coercive and insulting. The question for the Leader of the Opposition is: does he agree, deep down, with Senator Carr? I know the last thing the Leader of the Opposition needs right now is another fight with a Senate frontbencher - he has got too many of them running. This is a fight he should have. This is something he should do. He should and must pull Senator Carr into line and this time he would be doing it for a good cause. He would not be pulling a Labor senator into line to save his job; he would be pulling a Labor senator into line to protect the interests of the Indigenous people of our country.</DOC>

 - In answer, very directly, to the Leader of the Opposition's question: yes, I can confirm that it does provide that. I have ascertained that she did not obtain, as strictly required by the code, the statement from Mr Crooke. The reason advanced by the minister is that it was in the character of a short-term employment. That of itself does not excuse any parliamentary secretary or minister from the requirement to obtain that.The Leader of the Opposition asks me whether, in the light of that and in the light of her having exceeded her authority and in the light of other alleged misdeeds, I should terminate her commission. The answer is no, I should not terminate her commission. I am glad the Leader of the Opposition has asked this question. Let me deal with the principal allegation. The principal allegation against the minister is that she exceeded her authority by authorising - by approving - regional partnership grants after she had ceased to have any portfolio responsibility for that. That is the principal charge. That charge has simply not been substantiated by the opposition. I have personally read the departmental minute relating to the principal grant that has been under debate in this House over the past few days. It is manifest, on the basis of that document, that the former parliamentary secretary - the now minister - approved that project at 3.37 p.m. on the afternoon of 31 August 2004, when she clearly had the -  -  - The opposition interjects about the insertion of the time. Knowing that the caretaker period was to commence at 5 o'clock on 31 August, it was, I might say, commendable prudence by the parliamentary secretary to actually insert the time that she approved the particular grant. It has been explained, both by the DLO and by the minister, that the letter in question was not dispatched until a date early in December, by which time the minister had ceased to be parliamentary secretary and had become a minister. There is therefore absolutely no substance at all to the allegation that she exceeded her authority. There was a clerical oversight. There was a clerical oversight when the now shadow Treasurer wrote to the current Treasurer on his old letterhead of shadow minister for family and community services. If the House wants me to produce that letter I am very very happy to do so.Of course there was a clerical oversight, but we have witnessed from the Australian Labor Party over the past few days an attempt to beat life into an issue that has not involved any misdeed by the minister. Yes, there was a noncompliance with an item in the code, and I will plainly say that. But that alone is not in my view a sufficient reason to require the minister to hand in her commission. But I will tell you something that will be required: in a few minutes time there will be tabled in this House a royal commission report that will detail a chain of events whereby - A Member may not anticipate the discussion of a subject which appears on the Notice Paper.I remind honourable members that there is nothing on the Notice Paper in reference to what the member for Gellibrand has raised. And this is not the Notice Paper. The honourable Prime Minister has the call. - That is not the Notice Paper, it is the blue. - What this report will reveal is that on the watch of the Keating government $42 million -  - I was asked a question about ministerial responsibilities. I was asked about the ministerial responsibility of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and I explained the behaviour of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs continues to enjoy my full confidence, I make that very plain. While we are on the subject of ministerial responsibility, the House will learn of how $42 million was ripped off from the Australian taxpayer. And they talk about community grants! We will learn a bit -  - I simply say in relation to what the Leader of the Opposition has put to me concerning the behaviour of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs that the charge against her was that when she approved these grants she was the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and not the parliamentary secretary. That was the charge. Now, all the evidence indicates that she approved these grants while she was still the parliamentary secretary and, through clerical inadvertence, the letters were not sent out until after she had become the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. It is plain on any examination of the file that that is what has happened and, deep down, the members of the Labor Party know that is the case. They know that the last two or three days has been a total charade designed to cover up the embarrassment the Leader of the Opposition is now facing. Nobody with any skerrick of objectivity in this place could think otherwise.Of course it was a clerical error that those letters were not sent out, and of course this will be a lesson to any parliamentary secretary in the future who does not obtain the statement of those pecuniary interests. But taking into account the totality of her behaviour, to require her resignation on the basis of this is an insult to a proper administration of the concepts of ministerial responsibility, particularly coming from a group of men and women whose ministerial predecessors, asleep at the wheel, allowed the taxpayer to be ripped off to the tune of $42 million.</DOC>
