language is the normal way humans communicate .
only humans use language , though many other animals communicate in various ways . human language has *UNKNOWN* , a set of rules for connecting words together to make statements and question .
language can also be changed , by adding new words , for example , to describe new things .
other animals may inherit a set of calls which have pre-set functions .
language may be done by speech or by writing or by moving the hands to make signs .
it follows that language is not just any way of communicating .
even some human communication is not language : see *UNKNOWN* communication .
humans also use language for thinking .
language is a word that may be used by extension : the language of a community or country .
the faculty of speech .
formal language in mathematics , logic and computing .
sign language for deaf people *UNKNOWN* people who can not hear *UNKNOWN* .
a type of school subject . *UNKNOWN* says that *UNKNOWN* languages are at risk of becoming *UNKNOWN* .
*UNKNOWN* of language
all languages share certain things which separate them from all other kinds of communication .
a language has rules which are shared by a community .
all human languages are based on sound and hearing , or in the case of sign language , vision .
all the basic sound units , or *UNKNOWN* , have this in common : they can be spoken by the human voice , and heard by the human ear .
the sounds come out in a sequence , not all at once .
this is *UNKNOWN* in writing , where the marks are put on the paper or screen in the same sequence .
the stream of sounds have little gaps between them , and come in bigger packages .
we call the bigger packets sentences or questions or replies or comments .
in most languages , *UNKNOWN* being one , the order of the words can change the meaning : `` the cat sat on the man '' is different from `` the man sat on the cat '' .
words *UNKNOWN* which may be made up of more than one *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* divide up into two classes : content and *UNKNOWN* .
content words have meaning : *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* etc. .
*UNKNOWN* words are there to make the language work : and , not , in , out , what , etc. .
grammar consists of studying how words fit together to mean something .
all languages have :
sentences with two types of expression : *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* : *UNKNOWN* is here .
adjectives to modify *UNKNOWN* : good food .
ways of linking : sink or swim .
dummy elements : *UNKNOWN* likes to swim , so do *UNKNOWN*
devices to order or ask questions : get up ! are you ill ?
most of the languages have a written form .
before the invention of recording , the writing system was the only way to keep track of spoken information .
all languages constantly evolve .
new words appear , new form of saying things , new *UNKNOWN* .
there are many more things in common between languages .
*UNKNOWN* capacity to learn and use language is inherited .
normally , all humans are born with this capability .
which language is learned by a child depends on which language is spoken by the child 's community .
the capacity is inherited , but the particular language is learned .
children have a special period , from about 18 months to about four years , which is critical for learning the language .
if this is seriously disrupted , then their language skills will be damaged .
adults do not learn languages the same way they did when they were young .
so if they learn a second language , it is difficult , and they have little chance of speaking it as well as their native language .
some children have more than one native language like when they live in a foreign country or when their father speaks a different language from their mother .
types of language
mathematics and computer science use created languages called formal languages *UNKNOWN* like computer programming languages *UNKNOWN* , but these may or may not be *UNKNOWN* true ' languages .
mathematics itself is seen as a language by many .
some people consider musical notation to be a way of writing the musical language .
*UNKNOWN* is the language with the most native speakers in the world , but *UNKNOWN* is not really a language .
it is a close family of *UNKNOWN* , some of which are as different as romance languages are from one another .
*UNKNOWN* is often called `` the international language '' .
it is the main second language of the world and the language of science , business , and entertainment .
*UNKNOWN* as a first language : 380 million .
*UNKNOWN*
*UNKNOWN* as an official second language : up to 300 million .
*UNKNOWN* taught as a second language , but with no official status : anyone 's guess , up to 1000 million .
*UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* : 390 million native speakers .
*UNKNOWN*
another of these languages is called *UNKNOWN* , which was popular about a hundred years ago but is much less popular now .
