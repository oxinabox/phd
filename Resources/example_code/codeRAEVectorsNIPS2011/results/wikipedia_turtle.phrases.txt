turtles are *UNKNOWN* of the order *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* or *UNKNOWN*
turtle , *UNKNOWN* or *UNKNOWN*
the word *UNKNOWN* is popular among *UNKNOWN* , scientists , and conservationists working with these animals as a catch-all name for any member of the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , which includes all turtles living and *UNKNOWN* , as well as their immediate ancestors .
anatomy and *UNKNOWN* largest living *UNKNOWN* is the *UNKNOWN* sea turtle *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , which reaches a shell length of
giant *UNKNOWN* of the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* , and others were relatively widely distributed around the world into prehistoric times , and are known to have existed in north and south *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* , and *UNKNOWN* .
they became *UNKNOWN* at the same time as the appearance of man , and it is assumed humans hunted them for food .
the only surviving giant *UNKNOWN* are on the *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* islands , and can grow to over
neck withdrawal
turtles are divided into two groups according to how they withdraw their necks into their shells *UNKNOWN* something the ancestral *UNKNOWN* could not do *UNKNOWN* .
the *UNKNOWN* withdraw their necks backwards while contracting it under their spine , whereas the *UNKNOWN* contract their necks to the side .
head
most turtles that spend most of their lives on land have their eyes looking down at objects in front of them .
some *UNKNOWN* turtles , such as snapping turtles and *UNKNOWN* turtles , have eyes closer to the top of the head .
these species of turtles can hide from predators in shallow water , where they lie entirely submerged except for their eyes and nostrils .
near their eyes , sea turtles possess glands that produce *UNKNOWN* tears that rid their body of excess salt taken in from the water they drink . turtles have rigid beaks , and use their *UNKNOWN* to cut and *UNKNOWN* food .
instead of having teeth , which they appear to have lost about *UNKNOWN* million years ago , long in the tooth : *UNKNOWN* proves turtles evolve ... very slowly the upper and lower *UNKNOWN* of the turtle are covered by *UNKNOWN* ridges .
*UNKNOWN* turtles usually have *UNKNOWN* ridges for slicing through their prey .
*UNKNOWN* turtles have *UNKNOWN* ridges that help them cut through tough plants .
they use their *UNKNOWN* to swallow food , but unlike most *UNKNOWN* , they can not stick out their *UNKNOWN* to catch food .
shell
the upper shell of the turtle is called the *UNKNOWN* .
the lower shell that *UNKNOWN* the belly is called the *UNKNOWN* .
the *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* are joined together on the turtle 's sides by *UNKNOWN* structures called bridges .
the inner layer of a turtle 's shell is made up of about 60 bones that include portions of the backbone and the ribs , meaning the turtle can not crawl out of its shell .
in most turtles , the outer layer of the shell is covered by *UNKNOWN* scales called *UNKNOWN* that are part of its outer skin , or *UNKNOWN* .
*UNKNOWN* are made up of the fibrous protein *UNKNOWN* that also makes up the scales of other *UNKNOWN* .
these *UNKNOWN* overlap the *UNKNOWN* between the shell bones and add strength to the shell .
some turtles do not have *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
for example , the *UNKNOWN* sea turtle and the *UNKNOWN* turtles have shells covered with *UNKNOWN* skin , instead . the rigid shell means turtles can not breathe as other *UNKNOWN* do , by changing the volume of their chest cavities via expansion and contraction of the ribs .
instead , they breathe in two ways .
first , they employ *UNKNOWN* pumping , pulling air into their mouths , then pushing it into their lungs via *UNKNOWN* of the floor of the throat .
most *UNKNOWN* have a large , *UNKNOWN* shell that makes it difficult for predators to crush the shell between their *UNKNOWN* .
one of the few exceptions is the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , which has a flat , flexible shell that allows it to hide in rock *UNKNOWN* .
most *UNKNOWN* turtles have flat , streamlined shells which aid in swimming and diving .
*UNKNOWN* snapping turtles and *UNKNOWN* turtles have small , *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* that give them more efficient leg movement for walking along the bottom of ponds and streams . the color of a turtle 's shell may vary .
shells are commonly colored brown , black , or olive green .
in some species , shells may have red , orange , yellow , or gray markings , often spots , lines , or irregular blotches .
one of the most colorful turtles is the eastern painted turtle , which includes a yellow *UNKNOWN* and a black or olive shell with red markings around the rim . *UNKNOWN* , being land-based , have rather heavy shells .
in contrast , *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* turtles have lighter shells that help them avoid sinking in water and swim faster with more agility .
these lighter shells have large spaces called *UNKNOWN* between the shell bones .
the shells of *UNKNOWN* sea turtles are extremely light because they lack *UNKNOWN* and contain many *UNKNOWN* . it has been suggested by *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* 2002 *UNKNOWN* that the turtle shell can function as *UNKNOWN* buffer .
to endure through *UNKNOWN* conditions , such as winter periods trapped beneath ice or within *UNKNOWN* mud at the bottom of ponds , turtles utilize two general physiological mechanisms .
in the case of prolonged periods of *UNKNOWN* , it has been shown that the turtle shell both releases *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* acid .
skin and *UNKNOWN*
as mentioned above , the outer layer of the shell is part of the skin ; each *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* or plate *UNKNOWN* on the shell corresponds to a single modified scale .
the remainder of the skin is composed of skin with much smaller scales , similar to the skin of other *UNKNOWN* .
turtles do not *UNKNOWN* their skins all at once , as snakes do , but continuously , in small pieces .
when turtles are kept in *UNKNOWN* , small sheets of dead skin can be seen in the water *UNKNOWN* often appearing to be a thin piece of plastic *UNKNOWN* having been *UNKNOWN* off when the animals deliberately rub themselves against a piece of wood or stone .
*UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* have short , sturdy feet .
*UNKNOWN* are famous for moving slowly , in part because of their heavy , cumbersome shells , which restrict stride length .
amphibious turtles normally have limbs similar to those of *UNKNOWN* , except the feet are *UNKNOWN* and often have long claws .
these turtles swim using all four feet in a way similar to the dog *UNKNOWN* , with the feet on the left and right side of the body alternately providing thrust .
large turtles tend to swim less than smaller ones , and the very big species , such as alligator snapping turtles , hardly swim at all , preferring to walk along the bottom of the river or lake .
as well as *UNKNOWN* feet , turtles have very long claws , used to help them *UNKNOWN* onto riverbanks and floating logs upon which they *UNKNOWN* .
male turtles tend to have particularly long claws , and these appear to be used to stimulate the female while mating .
while most turtles have *UNKNOWN* feet , some , such as the *UNKNOWN* turtle , have true *UNKNOWN* , with the digits being fused into *UNKNOWN* and the claws being relatively small .
these species swim in the same way as sea turtles do *UNKNOWN* see below *UNKNOWN* . sea turtles are almost entirely *UNKNOWN* and have *UNKNOWN* instead of feet .
sea turtles fly through the water , using the up-and-down motion of the front *UNKNOWN* to generate thrust ; the back feet are not used for propulsion , but may be used as *UNKNOWN* for steering .
compared with *UNKNOWN* turtles , sea turtles have very limited mobility on land , and apart from the dash from the nest to the sea as *UNKNOWN* , male sea turtles normally never leave the sea .
females must come back onto land to lay eggs .
they move very slowly and laboriously , dragging themselves forwards with their *UNKNOWN* .
behaviour
*UNKNOWN* are thought to have exceptional night vision due to the unusually large number of *UNKNOWN* cells in their *UNKNOWN* .
turtles have color vision with a wealth of *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* with sensitivities ranging from the near ultraviolet *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* a *UNKNOWN* to red .
some land turtles have very poor pursuit movement abilities , which are normally found only in predators that hunt *UNKNOWN* prey , but *UNKNOWN* turtles are able to move their heads quickly to snap .
intelligence
it has been reported that wood turtles are better than white rats at learning to navigate *UNKNOWN* .
case studies exist of turtles playing .
in the laboratory , turtles *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* can learn novel *UNKNOWN* tasks and have demonstrated a long-term memory of at least 7.5 months .
*UNKNOWN* and life history
although many turtles spend large amounts of their lives underwater , all turtles and *UNKNOWN* breathe air , and must surface at regular intervals to *UNKNOWN* their lungs .
they can also spend much or all of their lives on dry land .
*UNKNOWN* respiration in *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* turtles is currently being studied .
some species have large *UNKNOWN* cavities that are lined with many *UNKNOWN* projections .
these projections , called *UNKNOWN* , have a rich blood supply , and increase the surface area of the *UNKNOWN* .
the turtles can take up dissolved oxygen from the water using these *UNKNOWN* , in much the same way that fish use *UNKNOWN* to *UNKNOWN* .
diet
a turtle 's diet varies greatly depending on the environment in which it lives .
adult turtles typically eat *UNKNOWN* plants ;
*UNKNOWN* and evolution
this is supported by fossils of the *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* or `` *UNKNOWN* turtle with teeth '' , from the late *UNKNOWN* , which have been found near *UNKNOWN* in southwest china .
*UNKNOWN* displays a complete *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* and an incomplete *UNKNOWN* , similar to an early stage of turtle *UNKNOWN* development .

in captivity
turtles , particularly small *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* turtles , are commonly kept as pets .
among the most popular are *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , and *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* .
it is illegal in every state in the *UNKNOWN* for anyone to sell any turtles under
as food , traditional medicine , and cosmetics
the flesh of turtles , *UNKNOWN* or *UNKNOWN* , was , and still is , considered a *UNKNOWN* in a number of cultures .
conservation *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* *UNKNOWN* , the *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* turtle specialist group published a report about the top 25 species of turtles most likely to become *UNKNOWN* , with a further 40 species at very high risk of becoming *UNKNOWN* .
this list excludes sea turtles , however both the *UNKNOWN* and the *UNKNOWN* 's *UNKNOWN* would make the top 25 list .
the report is due to be updated in four years time allowing to follow the evolution of the list .
between 48 to 54 % of all 328 of their species considered threatened , turtles and *UNKNOWN* are at a much higher risk of extinction than many other *UNKNOWN* .
of the 263 species of *UNKNOWN* and *UNKNOWN* turtles , 117 species are considered threatened , 73 are either endangered or critically endangered and 1 is *UNKNOWN* .
of the 58 species belonging to the *UNKNOWN* family , 33 species are threatened , 18 are either endangered or critically endangered , 1 is *UNKNOWN* in the wild and 7 species are *UNKNOWN* .
71 % of all *UNKNOWN* species are either gone or almost gone .
*UNKNOWN* species are the most endangered , closely followed by the five endemic species from *UNKNOWN* .
turtles face many threats , including habitat destruction , harvesting for consumption , and the pet trade .
the high extinction risk for *UNKNOWN* species is primarily due to the long-term unsustainable exploitation of turtles and *UNKNOWN* for consumption and traditional *UNKNOWN* medicine , and to a lesser extent for the international pet trade .
nonetheless , wild turtles continue to be caught and sent to market in large number *UNKNOWN* as well as to turtle farms , to be used as breeding stock
