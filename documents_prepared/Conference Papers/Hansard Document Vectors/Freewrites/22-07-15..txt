Ok. Freewriging.
Toook a day off yesterday.
Was feeling unmotivated.
Cos after fixing experiemnt on Monday, not I have no model that passes the test.
But that's cool, 
there are not significant problems with the test, as I understand it (of course).
Though some effort needs to go into asserting exactly what the test is testing.

I think it might need a new category (or two),
for word subsitution with random word of same POS class.
and for word subsitution with random word of different POS class.

The issue with the later is that I am not certain how confidant I can be that it will result 
in a nongrammatical sentence.
For example the sentence "Everything is going wrong" has going as a verb,
replace 'going' with the adjective: 'very', and we still have a gramatical sentence:
"everything is very wrong".
The other issue with this is that as i have set it up Unstemming, only works if the full Penn Treebank
POS tag of the new word is the same as the old. 
Obviously it won't be if I change the POS tags.

So back to the first option.
I Could perhaps ensure that it wasn't changing ot somehbting the same nby using one of wordnet's
semantic distance measures.
Not sure if actually nessisary.

Anyway that is freewriting done for today.
