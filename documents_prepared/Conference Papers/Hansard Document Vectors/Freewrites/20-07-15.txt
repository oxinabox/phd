Ok,
Freewriting
Week 2
here we go 
writing the things
I had a chill weekend.
one satursday has a swan con meeting.
I need to remind Izzy to send out an email about the open programming meeting.
I need to check the PRK/Brendan gets laura sorted so she can send emails.

We had lunch out at the karalee twice on saturday.
Which was cool.
I made risotto on Sunday.
That was nice enough,
I will have it for lunch today.

So I guess I am going to do some work on getting these publications ready.
That will be good.

I should look into EEVO (or what ever it was) that does something to do with verbs and structures.
I have 6 books out form the library right now,
I wonder how many I can have.

I need to get writing done.

started playing minecraft again on Sunday.
Good game.
Very habbit forming though,
as you get lots of incremetal rewards.

So I need to keep writing for 2 more minutes.

I guess my investigations into WSD didn't come to much.
I made somehting that beat the baseline, 
but not by a record breaking amount.
With that said what I did get out of it was to use the baseline as my normal WSD measure.
It works alright, and it is better than most things.
Still this is all very tenuous I feel.
I wonder If I could do a search across the tagged wikipedia for my missing sentences of identical structure.

I bet I could.
I'll give that a shot today.

I think I can be confidant that the semantic overlap will be low.
