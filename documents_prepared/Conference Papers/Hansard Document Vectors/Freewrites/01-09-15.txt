Here we are again.
Another day nearer to dying.
One more day standing about, what is it for.
Etc etc.

So yesterday was quiet good.
Dr Togneri was pleased wit hthe MRSPC results.

I am having issues with NeCTAR that is stopping me getting work done.
IU have contacted Chris B. About them now.
Hopefully will clear them up.

So I shall for now continue with my proposal.

Once that is done,
I would really like to work on the Reversing Sum of Word Embeddings 
that I talked about with Max.
That would be cool.
I know Dr Togneri would like to see a journal article out of the criticisms of 
phrase embeddings.
I think that can wait til after the conference, if/when it is accepted.
Since I may recieve valuable feedback there.

I like Isobel.

So anyway, today I will continue with my lit review.

I want a word embeddings table done.
