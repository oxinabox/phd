It seems to me, that I am starting later and later in the day.
I thought I would watch some TV today for coming in.
Now it is 12.

Perhaps I need to set my alarm, 
and get in to Uni by 9AM.
I will try that tomorrow.

So I guess starting later loses me time.
It also means I stay later maybe.
But maybe not.

I guess my motivation is down because I am writing.

I am going to try and do everything today in 10 minute blocks.
10 minutes of writing,
10 minutes of reading.
10 minutes of checking emails.
10 minutes of other things 
Blah blahb blah blah.

I do think freewring is helping.
I kinda want an ergonomic keyboard.
my hands are at quiet and angle ot the board most of the time 
I think hthat I thend to only use my fiurst to fingers on each hand when I type.
Especially my right hand.

Anyway.

So I am going to email my supervisors and tell them I'll have the draft by 5pm tomorrow.
Cos that seems doable.
A very rough draft.

its already way over length.
But that is fine.
Will not be an issue.

So that is the plan.
I think I will get result in to it today.
They will likely all have to be scraped out,
but it will make the results section discussable at the meeting.

hmm, perhaps I should try some more models still.
I can sepend 10 minutes checking on models.
