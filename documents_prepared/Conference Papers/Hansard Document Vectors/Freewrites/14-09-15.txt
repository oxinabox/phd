OK, here we go.
My fingers are kinda stiff.
Not cold just stiff.

been thinking more about my "How to UWA presentation".

Wow, really stiff fingers, heardf st move them.
Particularly my keft hand.

I hope I am not getter arthritis or anything.
I think my pressentation is looking good.\

I will time it later today.
I think it is visually quiet nice.

I am only 2 minu5tes into this freewrite.

Today I want to do my timeline and budget.

I can't get home too late as I need Izzy to give my beard a trim before graduation tommorrow.

I have to pick-up robes today.
I should really wash my hair too.

I guess i need to get home by 7 or 8.

I want to do my timeline and budget.
I want to include in my timeline conferences,
so I have them for reference.

I want to include in my lit review a * every time someone usa a LDC Corpus.

My presentation is a bit sparse on words,
I htink that is good.
Use the slides for diagrams people can hear my words.

No temptation to read slides.
