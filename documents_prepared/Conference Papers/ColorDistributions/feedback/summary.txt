# Non-minor:

## Compositionality
 - Should show figures for  “purplish red", "purplish",  "red" and "purple" and "ish" so can see combination effects. 
 - Show that sentence with different ordering of its words can yield different color description.
 - At least, there should be some examples and analyses on "compositional" or "non-compositional" color names.
 - What changes of model parameters are observed from Extrapolation CDEST, compared to Non-extrapolating CDEST?
     - *action*: re: this last point I am dubious if meaningful interpretation can be made of the network weight in this way.
  
## Binning
 - Simple equal binning would miss fine details of color distributions. 
	- *action*: this isn't correct, since there is zero theoretical loss at the resolution I am binning at. That is more clear in the current verion of the paper than it was before

 - The "discretize and then blur" framework described in Section 3.2 seems unnecessarily complicated. 

 -  I would like to see more sophisticated statistical method for color space, such as the mixture of Gaussians or even Gaussian processes
 -  Why not first perform kernel density estimation using a Gaussian kernel
	- *action*:  Kernal density reasonable would need a Von Mises kernel
  

## Distribution vs Point Estimate & multimodality.
  - "Multimodal" is not defined well.  The paper gives some examples such as 'greenish blue'. But what is the difference between multimodal and multi-token descriptions?
	- *action:* term is well define in literature (e.g. any text of probability distributions) but clearly this reverser did not get it.

 - Need to Better explain why point estimate is not suitable.
 - Include a point estimate based metric, e.g. MSE to peak
 - Including results about a point estimation as well as distribution estimation would likely also please the reviewers wanting more on the binning.


# Minor: 
 
## Embeddings
 - Weakness argument 5:  Embedding representation is not clearly described.  It is only mentioned around line 440.
	- *action*: given more space could go to town discussing this, e.g. show some TSNE scatter plots.

### Specification 
  - The training of the CDEST model is not well specified in the paper. Re: Optimiser and Initialisation weight etc
  
  
## Per individual difference  
 - Weakness argument 4:  The paper mentions differences among individuals, but it does not evaluate the proposed system with respect to such differences.
	- *action* Not touching this. Solving this goes into needing to do some kinda user modelling from demographic info. That data is technically available, but seems out of scope.
