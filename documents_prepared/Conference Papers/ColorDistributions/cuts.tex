Rather than representing each observation as a one-hot output with the hot cell being the bin it lays in, we represent it as a histogram of values for a continuous probability distribution with the expected value being the original value of the observation.
This can be seen as blurring a one-hot representation.
By adding this blur to all observations, it encourages the classifier to learn at lower level the tied value between the adjunct bins.
For representations of the Saturation and Value channels a truncated Gaussian distribution is used for the representation, restricting the value to between 0 and 1.
For the Hue channel wrapped normal distribution is used
