We would like to submit this paper entitled:
"DataDeps.jl: Repeatable Data Setup for Reproducible Data Science"
and the accompanying software:  "DataDeps.jl" v0.2.6,
for the JMLR machine learning open source software section.

It describes a package for automating the setup of data dependencies.
It has applications in improving the replicability of machine learning experimental scripts, and in the deployment of machine learning models.

The software is released under the MIT licence.
It is for the julia programming language.
To our knowledge, it is currently being used by at least 3 packages, and by several individuals for their research scripts.

It's web-page, including documentation, source code, and issue tracker is at 
https://github.com/oxinabox/DataDeps.jl
