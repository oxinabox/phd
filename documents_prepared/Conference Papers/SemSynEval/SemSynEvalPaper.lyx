\begin_layout Abstract
Several approaches for embedding a sentence into a vector space have been
 developed recently.
 It is unclear as to the information contained into these embeddings.
 To what extent the position inspace reflect semantic meaning, rather than
 other factors such as syntactic structure.
 For many applications it is most desirably to be encoding the meaning in
 the embedding.
 Currently the semantic localization is assessed indirectly through practical
 benchmarks on these applications.
 Here a new method is presented to directly assess if the embeddings produced
 by a model are semantically consistent.
 It is demonstrated on 3 existing models and on a bag of words benchmark.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This new method uses as synthetic corpus constructed from a paraphrase corpus,
 by using word replacement to generate sentences which are semantically
 equivalent, or not, to the original sentences.
 The embedding distances between the original and the synthetic sentences
 can then be compared ot the distances between the original and the semantically
 equivalent paraphrase.
 This thus allows the assessment as to strength of the link between semantic
 closeness and the embedding closeness.

\begin_layout Standard
Various sentence embeddings are often called semantic vector space representatio
ns, such as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The embedding the meaning of a sentence into a vector space is highly desirable.
 A wide array of tools exist which can handle vector representations, but
 not natural language discourse.
 Vector embeddings of a sentence may encode a number of factors including
 semantic meaning, syntactic structure or topic.
 Since many of these embeddings are learned unsupervised on textual corpora,
 it is not entirely clear the emphasis placed on each factor in the encoding.
 For certain applications encoding semantic meaning is particularly desirable.
 These applications include
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I have a paper that uses embeddings for many of these
\end_layout

\end_inset

, machine translation, automatic summarization, and to a lesser extent sentiment
 recognition.
 For successful application to these areas it is required that the embeddings
 generated by the models correctly encode meaning such that sentences with
 the same meaning are co-located in the vector space, and sentences with
 significantly differing meanings are further away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Current methods to produce these embeddings generate them as a byproduct
 of unsupervised tasks.

; and structural classification as in

.
 These methods learn the vector representations of their inputs which is
 best for the optimization function of their choice -- one for which sufficient
 training data exists.
 The methods are then used as a feature detectors step in other tasks.
 The information captured by the methods has proved to be very useful in
 these other tasks approach or exceeding previous state-of-the-art results
 in sentiment analysis and paraphrase detection.
 It is not entirely clear, though, the precise nature of the information
 captured, is it semantic, syntactic, topical or some other factor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper aims to provide a method to assess if the models are capturing
 semantic information.
 The strict definition of semantic equivalence for sentences is that each
 shall entail the other.
 This method will allow us to directly assess as to whether an give models
 embedding of the sentence is a encoding of meaning, consistent with the
 encodings for other sentences with similar meanings.
 The method functions in rough terms, by checking if sentence with meaning
 the same thing are located closely; and whether sentences of different
 meanings are located distantly.
 To do this a synthetic evaluation corpus is developed from existing resources
 though word substitution.
 Correctly separating sentences with similar word content and structure
 but different meaning, is a challenging task and proves a models semantic
 encoding strength.
 Assessment on this task will allow a better understanding of how these
 models work, and suggest new directions for the development in this area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The paper shall be laid out as in 5 sections.
 The Related Works section discusses the linguistic underpinnings of this
 work as well as various models and how they are currently assessed.
 The Methodology section describes the development of the evaluation corpus
 and how it is used to evaluated the semantic consistency of a model.
 The Results and Discussion section applies the method to 4 existing models
 and discusses the implications for their accuracy.
 The Conclusion closes the paper and suggests new directions for development.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Semantic Equivalence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sentences are said to be semantically equivalent if they each imply the
 other -- the relationship is that of bidirectional entailment.
 If we consider two sentences A and B.
 A is equivalent to B if A being true implies that B also must be true,
 and if B is true then A also must be true.
 This definition is closely related to that for logical equivalence.
 Linguistically different but equivalent sentences are said to be paraphrases
 of each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The paraphrases from the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MSRPC) were
 judged by the human raters to have the same high-level meaning, and to
 show 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mostly bidirectional entailment
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "msrParapharaCorpus"

\end_inset

.
 That is to say, that while each sentence may contain information which
 is not implied by the other, the core meaning of the sentences is entailed
 by both.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "msrParapharaCorpus"

\end_inset

 provides the examples of:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Sentence
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

A: Charles O.
 Prince, 53, was named as Mr.
 Weill’s successor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Sentence
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

B: Mr.
 Weill’s longtime confidant, Charles O.
 Prince, 53, was named as his successor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While additional information is present in Sentence B, still each sentence
 implies most of the meaning of the other.
 Thus while not semantically equivalent, they are considered semantically
 close.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should be noted that that semantic similarity is often defined differently
 for words.
 While semantic similarity for sentences is defined in terms of shared meaning
 and mutual entailment, semantic similarity for words can be defined in
 terms of shared properties
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "manning1999foundations"

\end_inset

.
 For example: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fall
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are antonyms, but are under the aforementioned definition for word semantic
 similarity are very similar: they both describe an vertical change in (potentia
lly metaphorical) position.
 However, the sentences 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The share price is predicted to rise.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The share price is predicted to fall.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are not semantically similar sentences, as they do not imply each other
 - in-fact each implies that the other is false.
 This sentence definition of semantic equivalence can be seen to be essential
 in applications such as machine translation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Substitutions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the basic tests for determining the part of speech a word of unknown
 lexical category is to substitute a word of known category in its place,
 if the sentence is still correct, then the unknown word may have that category
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "radford2004minimalist"

\end_inset

.
 For example if a sentence contains the never seen word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

foobar
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and substituting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in its place is grammatical, it can be concluded that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

foobar
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is most likely also a noun.
 It has been suggested that this is the mechanism by which people learn
 the parts of speech relations.
 In general, substitutions of the same parts of speech are valid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For any given word, its synonym or its antonym will have make up the same
 part of speech.
 It is thus grammatically valid to subsitute a synonym or antonym into that
 place.
 Substituting a synonym is not expected to change the meaning of the sentence,
 thus such a substitution creates a new sentence which is semantically equivalen
t.
 Indeed this has been proposed as the very definition of synonymy (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "miller1991contextualsemantics"

\end_inset

 attributes this definition to Leibniz), though there has been some debate
 over the nature and degree of this relation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "miller1991contextualsemantics"

\end_inset

.
 It has been noted in a limited study that subjects could identify whether
 an adjective or its antonym belong in blanked out section of a sentence
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "APS:2745308"

\end_inset

.
 This suggests that identical sentences up to an antonym swap in adjectives,
 may not occur in natural English
\begin_inset Note Comment
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It would be better to refer to a paper about verbs and nouns
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Never-the-less, such a swap is still a part-of-speech matched substitution
 and thus is grammatical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Semantic Similarity from Word Similarity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many past approaches towards measuring the semantic similarity of sentences
 have come from extending known results about the semantic similarity of
 words.
 Semantic relationships between words are well established, and large resources
 are available for them.
 These include both knowledge based approaches, and corpus based approaches.
 The knowledge based approaches for word semantic relations include WordNets
 categorizing of synonyms, antonyms, hypernyms and hyponyms.
 Corpus bases approach use various forms of information derived from word
 co-occurrences, such as in latent semantic analysis.
 These methods can be combined with a bag-of-word approach to apply to sentences
, as was done in the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "mihalcea2006corpus"

\end_inset

.
 Though, as acknowledged in that work, methods such as this, which ignore
 the structure of sentences are ultimately limited in there potential.
 Incorporating structure into the analysis is one of the great promises
 of current vector embedding models

\begin_layout Subsection
Evaluation Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As discussed in the introduction, current methods of evaluating the quality
 of embedding are on direct practical applications.
 The evaluation methods are not directly link to the methods used for training.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Paraphrase Detection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Closely related to the corpus used for evaluation here are paraphrase corpora
 such as MSRP.
 The paraphrase corpora and paraphrase detection tasks present sentences
 and possible paraphrases.
 The goal is to determine weather a sentence is a paraphrase of another
 or not.
 
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Could mention here the embeddigns are used as a feature for classification?
\end_layout

\end_inset

This implicitly requires working out if the sentences are semantically equivalen
t.
 However the corpora are not control to present syntactically similar sentences,
 thus can not be use to assess to prevalence of syntactic vs semantic informatio
n in the vector encoding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Paraphrases for Plagiarism corpus (P4P)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "barron2013plagiarism"

\end_inset

 does have useful information on the types of changes and relations between
 the compared texts, but is not a sentence orientated corpus.
 P4P compares short paragraphs, giving more context.
 While this results in a deeper and more meaningful paraphrasing task, the
 multiple sentences complicates the evaluation, and renders some embedding
 methods (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SocherEtAl2013:CVG,SocherEtAl2011:PoolRAE,Socher2011ParsingPhrases,socher2010PhraseEmbedding,SocherEtAl2011:RAE"

\end_inset

) unable to directly process the result.
 As with other paraphrasing corpora it also does not constrain the structure
 of sentences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Sentiment Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sentiment Analysis is another often used technique for evaluating the quality
 of embedding.
 It was used both for Recussive Autoencoder in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SocherEtAl2011:RAE"

\end_inset

and for the paragraph vector models in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "le2014distributed"

\end_inset

.
 Determining the sentiment of a sentence is partially a semantic task, but
 it does have pragmatic concerns.
 Sentences with the same semantic meaning may convey different sentiment.
 For example 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The movie was a heart-wretching tragedy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The most depressing film I have seen.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, it could be argues these a semantically close, but of very different sentiment.
 Success at sentiment classification is a valuable property that some sentence
 embedding models have shown, but it is not a direct indication of semantic
 consistency.

\begin_layout Standard
The Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MSRPC)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 is used as a base source of sentences, and of the ground truth for their
 semantic equality.
 The sentences with paraphrases provided are combined from the training
 and testing sets.
 This gives 7,800 sentences for evaluation.
 Of these 311 are repeated -- that is they have multiple different paraphrases
 specified -- no special handling is done for these cases.
 The sentences are modified by the procedure described below to create semantica
lly equivalent and semantically distinct versions.

 WordNet organizes the words in to sets of synonymous words called synsets.
 WordNet only stores the base word form i.e.
 lemma for each word, but the Morphy tool is provided to lookup the lemma
 for the words inflicted forms
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Thus WordNet can be used to find the replacement words need for the modificatio

The first step is to tokenize the sentence.
 This was achieved using the NLTK
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Treebank Word Tokenizer.
 This tokenizer is based on regular expressions.
 It splits the sentences in to words, punctuation elements, and also separates
 contractions:

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The Stanford POS Tagger, has a 97.24% accuracy on the Penn Treebank Wall

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "StandfordPOSTagger"

\end_inset

.
 It is one of the best POS taggers available.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though it does still make some mistakes, for example, in the sentence: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Cadets were ticketted for drinking alcohol.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 drinking is mistaken for a noun, when it should be a verb.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sentences are tagged with the Penn Treebank tagset
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Penn_POS_Taggening"

\end_inset

.
 This tagset contains 37 POS tags.
 Of interest to this work are the tags for nouns and verbs.
 Valid noun tags for transformation are NN and NNS, which covers singular,
 mass and plural nouns.
 The proper noun tags NNP and NNPS are not valid for transformation and
 are excluded.
 Valid verbs are marked those marked with all verb tags (VB,VBD,VBG, VBN,
 VBZ, VBP), except for models (MD) and auxiliaries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Model and auxiliary verbs are normally inverted by inserting a not after
 the verb, or equivalently a contraction n't.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "radford2004english"

\end_inset

 This is forbidden by the guideline of not changing the structure in the
 generated sentences.
 Thus model verbs and auxiliaries are excluded.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the POS tagger captures models with the MD tag, the other auxiliary
 verbs are not caught.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 states they are to be handles as other verbs.
 Some of them also have non-auxiliary senses, for example 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

has
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

he has gone
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is an auxiliary
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "radford2004english"

\end_inset

, but in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He has a dog
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it is not.
 WordNet also does not differentiate auxiliaries from other verbs, and so
 in both cases suggests that antonym for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

has
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lacks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 To avoid any confusion of this sort auxiliary verbs are blocked using a
 blacklist.
 This blocks changes to: "be", "am", "are", "is", "was", "were", "being",
 "can", "could", "do", "did", "does", "doing", "have", "had", "has", "having",
 "may", "might", "must", "shall", "should", "will", and "would".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WordNet uses much simpler parts of speech tags, as it only considered lemmas.
 WordNet POS tags are: noun, verb, adverb and adjective.
 The Penn Treebank POS tags can be simplified down to them.
 Further more, the additional information captured in the Penn Treebank
 Tags, is sufficient to allow recover the full form an a lemma generated
 from WordNet.

 This adds a word, violating the constraint of not changing the sentence's

 To avoid all these issues entirely, we forbid the substituting for any
 words in a phrase, as well as forbidding substituting a phrase for any
 words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These phrases are detected using a sliding window of width 3 and 2 words
 across the sentences.
 The words in the window are then checked to see if they form a phrase known
 to WordNet.
 If they do then they are blocked from substitution.
 This blocks all such phrases of up to length 3, covering the vast majority
 of cases.
 
\end_layout

While this blocks continuous phrases it does not handle other kinds.
 Several other kinds of phrases have been distinguished as having distinct

\begin_layout Standard
Word sense disambiguation is used to select the correct sense of the word
 being substituted for -- so that it synonym or antonym is the same sense.
 This is used for example to ensure that the synonym of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bank
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as in a financial institution, is not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shore
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as in the edge of a body of water

\end_inset

.
 While several methods were considered for performing the word sense disambiguat
ion, it was resolve to use the simple Most Frequent Sense (MFS).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MFS is a naïve method for determining word sense.
 It functions by always choosing the word sense that occurs most often --
 without regard for context, beyond the POS tag of the word.
 This method is almost certain to make some mistakes, however more sophisticated
 algorithms have been shown to offer little improvement over it.

BabelNet
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "navigli2010babelnet"

\end_inset

 is a multilingual extension of WordNet that has seen significant use as
 a target for the evaluation of word sense disambiguation methods.
 In the English BabelNet WSD subtask at 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "navigli2013semeval"

\end_inset

, the MFS obtained a F1 score of 66.5%, the best competing algorithm scores
 68.6%.
 Since then, new methods have improved that to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "basile-caputo-semeraro:2014:Coling"

\end_inset

 71.5% -- which exceeds MFS by 5%.
 On a similar task at 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "moro2015semeval"

\end_inset

, no entry exceeded the MFS F1 score of 67.5%.
 As simple MFS remains one of the most competitive methods it is used in
 this system.

Noun Synonyms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As discussed above, all words sorted in WordNet are stored in synsets
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "miller1995wordnet"

\end_inset

.
 A synset contains many lemmas all with the same semantic meaning.
 Any given word may have many word-senses, each word-sense for that word
 belongs to a different synset.
 All the lemmas within a synset are synonymous.
 The synonyms of a noun are all the lemmas form the correct synset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Verb Antonyms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verbs, as nouns are stored in synsets.
 WordNet stores antonyms on a per-lemma basis.
 The possible antonyms for a given verb are thus the antonym of the lemma,
 and also of the any synonyms -- lemmas from the same synset.
 This extension increases the number of antonym lemmas available for any
 base lemma.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the words generated from WordNet are lemmatized, this process must be
 reversed to restore them to their grammatically correct from for the context.
 For example, the verbs, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rose
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rising
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are all mapped to the lemma 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, from this lemma we generate the antonym: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fall
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, to put it into the context of the first word, it needs to be mapped to
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fall
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fell
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

falling
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 respectively.
 Similarly, for nouns lemmatization removes plurals.
 The needed information for both is captured in the parts of speech tags.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Penn Treebank POS tags captures the information required to go from
 a lemma to the correct form.
 This can be used with the heuristic conjugation and pluralization methods
 from the Pattern.en library

Sequential addition of substitutions

For each sentence, for each verb/noun with a valid substitution that substitutio
n is made progressively.
 Starting with the base sentence, first one word is changed, and the new
 sentence added to the corpus, than another and so forth until valid substitutio
ns are exhausted.
 This is applied separately for nouns and verbs to generate the two test
 sets.
 These progressive additions allow investigation into whether simple word
 content affects reported distances, as well as into the effects of double
 negation.
 Examples of this can be seen in the next section.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A given model may be evaluated on how semantically close, or distantly it
 places sentences which are semantically equivalent, or not.
 As discussed, replacing a noun with its synonym produces a semantically
 equivalent sentence -- both the original sentence, and the modified sentence
 entail the other.
 Conversely, replacing a verb with its antonym generally will produce a
 semantically different sentence, often the the modified sentence will entail
 the converse of the original and visa-verse.
 As a baseline for a reasonable distance under a model, the distance to
 the gold standard, semantically equal, paraphrase is computed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Scoring
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By comparing the distance from the base sentence embedding to the paraphrase
 and modified sentence embeddings, the success of the modal at semantic
 localization is evaluated.
 It is assessed on keeping close semantically similar sentences, and distant
 semantically distinct sentences.
 A semantically different sentence must be further away that a semantically
 equivalent one, thus the sentences modified by replacing verbs with their
 antonyms must be more distant than the semantically equal paraphrase.
 Conversely, the semantically identical similar form should be no further
 away than the paraphrase.
 By counting the portion of the evaluation corpus is correctly placed under
 this definition, the models semantic semantic accuracy with respect to
 fine-grained changed is scored.

Distance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Distance may be calculated though any method the model specifies.
 The All the model chosen below, use the cosine distance (or equivalently
 cosign similarity).
 This is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $d(\tilde{u},\tilde{v})=1-\dfrac{\tilde{u}\cdot\tilde{v}}{\left\Vert \tilde{u}\right\Vert _{2}\left\Vert \tilde{v}\right\Vert _{2}}$
\end_inset

, this is between 0, and 2 and is proportional to the cosine of the angle
 between the embeddings 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{v}$

.
 It's optimization target is to be be able to reverse (unfold) the merges
 and produce the original sentence.
 The central folding layer - where the whole sentence is collapsed to a
 single embedding vector is the representation.

 from the current develop branch.

\begin_layout Standard
Distributed Memory Paragraph Vectors (PV-DM) Doc2Vec document embeddings
 are based on an extension of Continuous Bag-of-Words word-embedding model
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "mikolov2013efficient"

\end_inset

.
 It is trained using a sliding window of words to predict the next word.
 The softmax predictor network is feed a word-embedding for each word in
 the window, and an additional embedding vector which is reused for all
 words in the sentence (called the paragraph vector in original paper).
 These input embeddings can be concatenated or averaged, in the results
 show below they were concatenated.
 During training both word and sentence vectors are allows to vary, in evaluatio
n, the word vectors are locked and the sentence vector trained until convergence.

Baseline: Bag of Words
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The traditional bag of words model is presented as a baseline.
 There is a dimension in each vector for the count of each token, including
 punctuation.
 In bag of words, there is a direct relationship between the number of words
 in-common, the sentence length, and the distance.

Noun Synonym Distance vs Paraphrase Distance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Replacing one or more nouns with their synonyms does not break logical entailmen
t.
 Thus it is expected that a model locating in purely semantic space would
 locate the modified sentences at least as close to the original sentence,
 as the paraphrase was.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Portion of the evaluation cases where the distance from the base sentence
 to the sentence modified by noun substitution was less than, or equal to
 the distance from the base sentence to the paraphrase.
 Larger is better.

\begin_layout Standard
Unsurprisingly, the BOW model does very well for small number of changes,
 but is overtaken by the other models as the number of changes increases.
 This shows that the models do, to some extent recognise the lack of semantic
 change from the substitution.
 It can be seen that the U-RAE, outperfroms the PV-DM, which outperforms
 the PV-DBOW model.
 This order does correspond the significance each model places on structure,
 which may be significant.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Verb Antonym Distance vs Paraphrase Distance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Replacing one of more verbs with their antonyms generally breaks logical
 entailment.
 Thus it is expected that a model locating in purely semantic space would
 place the modified sentences at more distantly than the paraphrases were
 placed to the original.

\begin_inset Caption Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Portion of the evaluation cases where the distance from the base sentence
 to the sentence modified by verb antonym substitution was greater than,
 the distance from the base sentence to the paraphrase.
 Larger is better.

\begin_layout Standard
As is expected the BOW model performs very poorly -- it has no mechanism
 to recognize the additional significance of changing the verb to its opposite.
 The neural models do perform better, though still poorly.
 Indicating that some level of logical significance may being induced into
 the sentence embeddings.
 It is not clear whether double and quadrupedal negatives impacted the distance,
 though the decrease in relative distance between three and four substitutions
 for the U-RAE and PV-DM suggests that may be the case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Verb Antonym Distance vs Noun Synonym Distance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above metrics compared the modified sentences of different entailment
 to paraphrases with differing word content and structure.
 To compare solely on the modification to the key words, the distance between
 the noun synonym and verb antonym modified sentences can be compared.
 As the noun synonym modified sentences are semantically equivalent to the
 base sentences, it is expected that they be closer to the base sentence
 than the semantically different verb antonym sentences.

 the distance from the base sentence to the sentence modified by noun synonym
 substitution.
 Larger is better.

\begin_layout Standard
The BOW distance for a verb change and a noun change are under most circumstance
s exactly equal.
 The exception to this is when the change occurs in a word which results
 in the number of instances of the same word changing, eg if a sentence
 previously used the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

share
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 twice and one of those uses is changed to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

part
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 then the distance is different to if a non-repeated word was changed to
 another non-repeated word.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A method what presented, to evaluate the semantic localization of sentence
 embedding models.
 Semantically equivalent sentences are those which exhibit bidirectional
 entailment -- they each imply the truth of the other.
 Paraphrases are mostly semantically equivalent.
 Replacing a noun with its synonym creates another sentence which is semanticall
y equivalent to the original.
 Replacing a verb with its antonym creates a new sentence which is not.
 By comparing the distances of the generated sentences, and paraphrases
 from the original sentence, the relationship between semantic closeness
 and embedding distance can be seen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The models evaluated using this method show that they are substantially
 more permanent the a naive bag of words approach there is still significant
 room for improvement.
 While these models perform very well at related practical tasks, this new
 method highlights some of their limitations.
 It suggests that calling the vector space the models embed into a syntactic
 space is misleading.
 The space clearly incorporates elements of syntax and word choice, as well
 as meaning.
 This result is not surprising and indeed some papers (including 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SocherEtAl2011:PoolRAE"

\end_inset

) do refer to the space this way.
 The new method does make its truth substantially clearer.

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "iyyer2014generating"

\end_inset

, dependency trees are used instead of the constituency tree used in the
 original URAE, because of its improved invariance to syntactical changes.
 This may, by decreasing the impact of syntax create models with a greater
 emphasis on semantic placement.
