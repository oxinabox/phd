\begin_layout Abstract
Several approaches for embedding a sentence into a vector space have been
 developed recently.
 It is unclear as to the information contained into these embeddings.
 To what extent the position inspace reflect semantic meaning, rather than
 other factors such as syntactic structure.
 For many applications it is most desirably to be encoding the meaning in
 the embedding.
 Currently the semantic localization is assessed indirectly through practical
 benchmarks on these applications.
 Here a new method is presented to directly assess if the embeddings produced
 by a model are semantically consistent.
 It is demonstrated on 3 existing models and on a bag of words benchmark.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This new method uses as synthetic corpus constructed from a paraphrase corpus,
 by using word replacement to generate sentences which are semantically
 equivalent, or not, to the original sentences.
 The embedding distances between the original and the synthetic sentences
 can then be compared ot the distances between the original and the semantically
 equivalent paraphrase.
 This thus allows the assessment as to strength of the link between semantic
 closeness and the embedding closeness.

Various sentence embeddings are often called Semantic Vector Space Representatio
ns, such as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 This paper aims to provide a method to assess the accuracy of that statement.
 Such a tool will allow us to assert whether the vector representation of
 a given method is more influenced by the structure (syntax) of the sentence
 embedded, or of its meaning (semantics).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, the vector sentence models are very useful and functional.
 As developed the have been producing highly competitive benchmarks in a
 number of areas.
\begin_inset Note Comment

\end_inset

.
 These benchmarks, while showing the great practical use of techniques,
 do not look closely at the theoretical foundation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here a new method is presented to assess directly how accurate the methods
 localize sentences in semantic space.
 Checking if sentence which mean the same thing are located closely, or
 not; and whether sentences of different meanings are located distantly,
 or not.
 This will allow a better understanding of how these models work, and suggest
 new directions for the development in this area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Sentence Embedding
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several different terms have been used to decribe the notion of a sentence
 embedding.
 It is called a phrase embedding in the work of Sorcher et Al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SocherEtAl2013:CVG,SocherEtAl2011:PoolRAE,Socher2011ParsingPhrases,socher2010PhraseEmbedding,SocherEtAl2011:RAE"

\end_inset

, and is one form of what is called a paragraph or document embedding in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "le2014distributed"

\end_inset

.
 Semantically, a sentence is the expression of a single idea.
 Thus embedding sentences into vector spaces is the same as embedding ideas
 into vector spaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Semantic Equivalence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sentences are said to be semantically equivalent if they each imply the
 other -- the relationship is that of bidirectional entailment.
 If we consider two sentences A and B.
 A is equivalent to B if A being true implies that B also must be true,
 and if B is true then A also must be true.
 This definition is closely related to that for logical equivalence.
 Different equivalent sentences are said to be paraphrases of each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The paraphrases from the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MSRPC) were
 judged by the human raters to have the same high-level meaning, and to
 show 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mostly bidirectional entailment
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "msrParapharaCorpus"

\end_inset

.
 That is to say, that while each sentence may contain information which
 is not implied by the other, the core meaning of the sentences is entailed
 by both.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "msrParapharaCorpus"

\end_inset

 provides the examples of:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Sentence
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

A: Charles O.
 Prince, 53, was named as Mr.
 Weill’s successor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Sentence
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

B: Mr.
 Weill’s longtime confidant, Charles O.
 Prince, 53, was named as his successor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While additional information is present in Sentence B, still each sentence
 implies most of the meaning of the other.
 Thus while not semantically equivalent, they are considered semantically
 close.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should be noted that that semantic similarity is often defined differently
 for words.
 While semantic similarity for sentences is defined in terms of shared meaning
 and mutual entailment, semantic similarity for words can be defined in
 terms of shared properties
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "manning1999foundations"

\end_inset

.
 For example: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fall
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are antonyms, but are under the aforementioned definition for word semantic
 similarity are very similar: they both describe an vertical change in (potentia
lly metaphorical) position.
 However, the sentences 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The share price is predicted to rise.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The share price is predicted to fall.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are not semantically similar sentences, as they do not imply each other
 - in-fact each implies that the other is false.
 This sentence definition of semantic equivalence can be seen to be essential
 in applications such as machine translation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
A Substitution Based Evaluation Corpus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method proposed here to evaluate the semantic localization requires
 the construction of a corpus which contains semantically close and semantically
 distant sentences.
 To allow discrimination between embeddings which capture structure (syntax)
 or word content, and those which capture meaning, the semantically distinct
 sentences should have the same structure and word content except for the
 variations evaluated.
 Thus a method is required to change the meaning of sentences, without changing
 anything else.
 To change meaning at least one word must be changed.
 As the key action or statement of a sentence clause is given by its verb
\begin_inset Note Comment
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I can't quiet cite this.
 I can cite some closely related statements about syntax.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, replacing that verb with its antonym will substantially change the clauses
 meaning.
 This change will always break semantic entailment, though the pragmatic
 change may not always be as strong as in the share price example from above.
 Consider instead the sentences: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They inhaled the smog filled air.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They exhaled the smog filled air.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Clearly there is no bi-directional entailment between the two sentences,
 though pragmatically the meaning is similar -- the air the characters were
 breathing was smog-filled.
 As the number of verbs changed increase though the meaning generally gets
 more distant, though multiple negations may apply.
 For example: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They exhaled the smog emptied air
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Note Comment

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The natural sentence is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

They exhaled the smog cleared air
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but but my method produced emptied, wordnet considers 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cleared
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to be a hypernym of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

emptied
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Thus semantically distinct sentences are constructed.
 by progressively negating the verbs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To contrast this, and see the effect of simply changing words, but not structure
 or meaning, a second method is used.
 For this evaluation, nouns are replaced with their synonyms.
 Thus the structure and meaning are preserved, and only the word content
 is changed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Validity of Substitutions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the basic tests for determining the part of speech a word of unknown
 lexical category is to substitute a word of known category in its place,
 if the sentence is still correct, then the unknown word may have that category
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "radford2004minimalist"

\end_inset

.
 For example if a sentence contains the never seen word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

foobar
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and substituting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in its place is grammatical, it can be concluded that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

foobar
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is most likely also a noun.
 It has been suggested that this is the mechanism by which people learn
 the parts of speech relations.
 In general, substitutions of the same parts of speech are valid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As synonyms and antonyms make up the same parts of speech as their base
 form, it is grammatically valid to substitute for the original.
 Substituting a synonym is not expected to change the meaning of the sentence,
 thus such a substitution creates a new sentence which is semantically equivalen
t.
 Indeed this has been proposed as the very definition of synonymy (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "miller1991contextualsemantics"

\end_inset

 attributes this definition to Leibniz), though there has been some debate
 over the nature and degree of this relation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "miller1991contextualsemantics"

\end_inset

.
 It has been noted in a limited study that subjects could identify whether
 an adjective or its antonym belong in blanked out section of a sentence
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "APS:2745308"

\end_inset

.
 This suggests that identical sentences up to an antonym swap in adjectives,
 may not occur in natural English
\begin_inset Note Comment
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It would be better to refer to a paper about verbs and nouns
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Never-the-less, such a swap is still a part-of-speech matched substitution
 and thus is grammatical.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Paraphrase Corpora
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Closely related to the corpus use for evaluation here are paraphrase corpora
 such as MSRP.
 The paraphrase corpora and paraphrase detection tasks present sentences
 and possible paraphrases.
 The goal is to determine weather a sentence is a paraphrase of another
 or not.
 This implicitly requires working out if the sentences are semantically
 equivalent.
 However the corpora are not control to present syntactically similar sentences,
 thus can not be use to assess to prevalence of syntactic vs semantic informatio
n in the vector encoding.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 does have useful information on the types of changes and relations between
 the compared texts, but is not a sentence orientated corpus.
 P4P compares short paragraphs, giving more context.
 While this results in a deeper and more meaningful paraphrasing task, the
 multiple sentences complicates the evaluation, and renders some embedding
 methods (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "SocherEtAl2013:CVG,SocherEtAl2011:PoolRAE,Socher2011ParsingPhrases,socher2010PhraseEmbedding,SocherEtAl2011:RAE"

\end_inset

) unable to directly process the result.
 As with other paraphrasing corpora it also does not constrain the structure
 of sentences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Finding Structural Matches in Large Corpora
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inspection of large corpora will reveal that structurally identical sentences
 are rare.
 While Large corpora contain many thousands of sentences, very few have
 the same structure, or even same order of POS tags.
 For example, MASC
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "passonneau2012masc"

\end_inset

 (Manually Annotated Sub-Corpus of the Open American National Corpus) contains
 34,535 sentences, only 4,230 share a set and ordering of POS tags with
 another.
 Further: if trivial sentences with 5 or fewer tokens are excluded there
 are just 634.
 If sentences where 30% or more of the words are proper nouns, dates, times,
 or numbers are also excluded (thus removing sentences such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

'Posted by : tomemos | Sunday , 09 May 2010 at 09:16 AM'), only 316 sentences
 remain.
 Only a subset of these will be structurally identical when considered under
 a parse tree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus it is not surprising that MSRPC, which only contains 7800 sentences,
 contains 5 structurally identical sentences in two structural classes,
 other than paraphrases or differing only numerically.
 Even these sentences are highly similar in topic and word usage.
 Class 1: {'Schering-Plough shares fell 72 cents to close at $ 18.34 on the
 New York Stock Exchange .', 'Wal-Mart shares rose 16 cents to close at $
 58.28 on the New York Stock Exchange .', 'Xerox shares rose 2 cents to close
 at $ 11.45 on the New York Stock Exchange .'}, Class 2: {'Jason Giambi capitalize
d with an RBI single to center .', 'Randall Simon followed with an RBI single
 to right .'}.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, there is only one structural match between MSRPC and the MASC
 corpus: MSRPC contains: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm never going to forget this day.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is a structural match for the sentence: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm not going to allow that question.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from MASC.
 Thus it is not viable to find naturally occurring sentences of the same
 structure, but different meaning.

 Approximately 2500 sentences from a subset of MASC (Manually Annotated

 who were tasked with listing all the word synonyms that could replace words.
 CoInCo only handles synonym substitutions, though an effort could be made
 to automatically extend it to antonyms (and other lexical relations), by
 mapping substitution lemmas from CoInCo on to WordNet synsets.
 According to

What is required

To create a corpus capable of assessing the degree of semantic information,
 as compared to syntactic and word content information, a paraphrase corpus
 is extended through lexical substitutions maintaining the syntactic structure.

 The sentences with paraphrases provided are combined from the training

 This gives 7,800 sentences for evaluation.
 Of these 311 are repeated -- that is they have multiple different paraphrases
 specified -- no special handling is done for these cases.
 The sentences are modified by the procedure described below to create semantica

Cadets were ticketted for drinking alcohol.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sentences are tagged with the Penn Treebank tagset
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Penn_POS_Taggening"

.
 This tagset contains 37 POS tags.
 Of interest to this work are the tags for nouns and verbs.
 Valid noun tags for transformation are NN and NNS, which covers singular,
 mass and plural nouns.
 The proper noun tags NNP and NNPS are not valid for transformation and
 are excluded.
 Valid verbs are marked those marked with all verb tags (VB,VBD,VBG, VBN,
 VBZ, VBP), except for models (MD) and auxiliaries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Model and auxiliary verbs are normally inverted by inserting a not after
 the verb, or equivalently a contraction n't.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 This is forbidden by the guideline of not changing the structure in the

, but in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

He has a dog
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 it is not.
 WordNet also does not differentiate auxiliaries from other verbs, and so
 in both cases suggests that antonym for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

has
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lacks
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 To avoid any confusion of this sort auxiliary verbs are blocked using a
 blacklist.
 This blocks changes to: "be", "am", "are", "is", "was", "were", "being",
 "can", "could", "do", "did", "does", "doing", "have", "had", "has", "having",
 "may", "might", "must", "shall", "should", "will", and "would".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
WordNet uses much simpler parts of speech tags, as it only considered lemmas.
 WordNet POS tags are: noun, verb, adverb and adjective.
 The Penn Treebank POS tags can be simplified down to them.
 Further more, the additional information captured in the Penn Treebank
 Tags, is sufficient to allow recover the full form an a lemma generated

 This adds a word, violating the constraint of not changing the sentence's
 structure.
 To avoid all these issues entirely, we forbid the substituting for any
 words in a phrase, as well as forbidding substituting a phrase for any
 words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These collocations are detected using a sliding window of width 3 and 2
 words across the sentences.
 The words in the window are then checked to see if they form a collocations
 known to WordNet.
 If they do then they are blocked from substitution.
 This blocks all such collocations of up to length 3.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While this blocks all such continuous phrases it does not handle other kinds.
 Several other kinds of phrases have been distinguished as having distinct
 meaning.
 Such as the skip-bigrams considered by

.
 The necessity of avoiding substitutions with these is less clear.
 As they are not considered as clear single lexical entity (unlike the continous
 dictionary phrases), they may be sufficiently handled by word sense disambiguat
ion.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Word Sense Disambiguation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Word sense disambiguation is used to select the correct sense of the word
 being substituted for -- so that it synonym or antonym is the same sense.
 This is used for example to ensure that the synonym of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bank
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as in a financial institution, is not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shore
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as in the edge of a body of water
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "manning1999foundations"

\end_inset

.
 While several methods were considered for performing the word sense disambiguat
ion, it was resolve to use the simple Most Frequent Sense (MFS).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MFS is a naïve method for determining word sense.
 It functions by always choosing the word sense that occurs most often --
 without regard for context, beyond the POS tag of the word.
 This method is almost certain to make some mistakes, however more sophisticated
 algorithms have been shown to offer little improvement over it.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In the English BabelNet WSD subtask at 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "navigli2013semeval"

, the MFS obtained a F1 score of 66.5%, the best competing algorithm scores
 68.6%.
 Since then, new methods have improved that to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 71.5% -- which exceeds MFS by 5%.
 On a similar task at 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Standard
As discussed above, all words sorted in WordNet are stored in synsets
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "miller1995wordnet"

\end_inset

.
 A synset contains many lemmas all with the same semantic meaning.
 Any given word may have many word-senses, each word-sense for that word
 belongs to a different synset.
 All the lemmas within a synset are synonymous.
 The synonyms of a noun are all the lemmas form the correct synset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Verb Antonyms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Verbs, as nouns are stored in synsets.
 WordNet stores antonyms on a per-lemma basis.
 The possible antonyms for a given verb are thus the antonym of the lemma,
 and also of the any synonyms -- lemmas from the same synset.
 This extension increases the number of antonym lemmas available for any
 base lemma.

\begin_layout Standard
As the words generated from WordNet are lemmatized, this process must be
 reversed to restore them to their grammatically correct from for the context.
 For example, the verbs, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rose
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rising
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are all mapped to the lemma 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, from this lemma we generate the antonym: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fall
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, to put it into the context of the first word, it needs to be mapped to
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fall
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fell
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

falling

 respectively.
 Similarly, for nouns lemmatization removes plurals.
 The needed information for both is captured in the parts of speech tags.

Sequential addition of substitutions

For each sentence, for each verb/noun with a valid substitution that substitutio
n is made progressively.
 Starting with the base sentence, first one word is changed, and the new
 sentence added to the corpus, than another and so forth until valid substitutio
ns are exhausted.
 This is applied separately for nouns and verbs to generate the two test
 sets.
 These progressive additions allow investigation into whether simple word
 content affects reported distances, as well as into the effects of double
 negation.
 Examples of this can be seen in the next section.

\begin_layout Subsection
Evaluation Using the Corpus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A given model may be evaluated on how semantically close, or distantly it
 places sentences which are semantically equivalent, or not.
 As discussed, replacing a noun with its synonym produces a semantically
 equivalent sentence -- both the original sentence, and the modified sentence
 entail the other.
 Conversely, replacing a verb with its antonym generally will produce a
 semantically different sentence, often the the modified sentence will entail
 the converse of the original and visa-verse.
 As a baseline for a reasonable distance under a model, the distance to
 the gold standard, semantically equal, paraphrase is computed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Scoring
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By comparing the distance from the base sentence embedding to the paraphrase
 and modified sentence embeddings, the success of the modal at semantic
 localization is evaluated.
 It is assessed on keeping close semantically similar sentences, and distant
 semantically distinct sentences.
 A semantically different sentence must be further away that a semantically
 equivalent one, thus the sentences modified by replacing verbs with their
 antonyms must be more distant than the semantically equal paraphrase.
 Conversely, the semantically identical similar form should be no further
 away than the paraphrase.
 By counting the portion of the evaluation corpus is correctly placed under
 this definition, the models semantic semantic accuracy with respect to
 fine-grained changed is scored.

Distance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Distance may be calculated though any method the model specifies.
 The All the model chosen below, use the cosine distance (or equivalently
 cosign similarity).
 This is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $d(\tilde{u},\tilde{v})=1-\dfrac{\tilde{u}\cdot\tilde{v}}{\left\Vert \tilde{u}\right\Vert _{2}\left\Vert \tilde{v}\right\Vert _{2}}$
\end_inset

, this is between 0, and 2 and is proportional to the cosine of the angle
 between the embeddings 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{v}$

Unfolding Recursive Auto-Encoder (U-RAE)

The Unfolding Recursive Auto-Encoder is a autoencoder based method.
 It functions by using the same network to recursively pairwise combine
 embedded representations, following the parse tree
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 It's optimization target is to be be able to reverse (unfold) the merges
 and produce the original sentence.
 The central folding layer - where the whole sentence is collapsed to a
 single embedding vector is the representation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this evaluation we make use of the pretrained network the authors of

 from the current develop branch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both are trained on approximately 12 million sentences from 500 randomly

 In both the window size was set to 8 words, and the vectors were of 300
 dimensions.

\begin_layout Standard
Distributed Memory Paragraph Vectors (PV-DM) Doc2Vec document embeddings
 are based on an extension of Continuous Bag-of-Words word-embedding model
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "mikolov2013efficient"

\end_inset

.
 It is trained using a sliding window of words to predict the next word.
 The softmax predictor network is feed a word-embedding for each word in
 the window, and an additional embedding vector which is reused for all
 words in the sentence (called the paragraph vector in original paper).
 These input embeddings can be concatenated or averaged, in the results
 show below they were concatenated.
 During training both word and sentence vectors are allows to vary, in evaluatio
n, the word vectors are locked and the sentence vector trained until convergence.

\begin_layout Standard

 on the Skip-gram model for word-embeddings, also from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 In PV-DBOW a sentence vector is used as the sole input to a neural net.
 That network is tasked with predicting the words in the sentence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Baseline: Bag of Words
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The traditional bag of words model is presented as a baseline.
 There is a dimension in each vector for the count of each token, including
 punctuation.
 In bag of words, there is a direct relationship between the number of words
 in-common, the sentence length, and the distance.

Noun Synonym Distance vs Paraphrase Distance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Replacing one or more nouns with their synonyms does not break logical entailmen
t.
 Thus it is expected that a model locating in purely semantic space would
 locate the modified sentences at least as close to the original sentence,
 as the paraphrase was.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Portion of the evaluation cases where the distance from the base sentence
 to the sentence modified by noun substitution was less than, or equal to
 the distance from the base sentence to the paraphrase.
 Larger is better.

\begin_layout Standard
Unsurprisingly, the BOW model does very well for small number of changes,
 but is overtaken by the other models as the number of changes increases.
 This shows that the models do, to some extent recognise the lack of semantic
 change from the substitution.
 It can be seen that the U-RAE, outperfroms the PV-DM, which outperforms
 the PV-DBOW model.
 This order does correspond the significance each model places on structure,
 which may be significant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Verb Antonym Distance vs Paraphrase Distance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Replacing one of more verbs with their antonyms generally breaks logical
 entailment.
 Thus it is expected that a model locating in purely semantic space would
 place the modified sentences at more distantly than the paraphrases were
 placed to the original.

As is expected the BOW model performs very poorly -- it has no mechanism
 to recognize the additional significance of changing the verb to its opposite.
 The neural models do perform better, though still poorly.
 Indicating that some level of logical significance may being induced into
 the sentence embeddings.
 It is not clear whether double and quadrupedal negatives impacted the distance,
 though the decrease in relative distance between three and four substitutions
 for the U-RAE and PV-DM suggests that may be the case.

Verb Antonym Distance vs Noun Synonym Distance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above metrics compared the modified sentences of different entailment
 to paraphrases with differing word content and structure.
 To compare solely on the modification to the key words, the distance between
 the noun synonym and verb antonym modified sentences can be compared.
 As the noun synonym modified sentences are semantically equivalent to the
 base sentences, it is expected that they be closer to the base sentence
 than the semantically different verb antonym sentences.

\begin_layout Standard
The BOW distance for a verb change and a noun change are under most circumstance
s exactly equal.
 The exception to this is when the change occurs in a word which results
 in the number of instances of the same word changing, eg if a sentence
 previously used the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

share
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 twice and one of those uses is changed to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

part
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 then the distance is different to if a non-repeated word was changed to
 another non-repeated word.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A method what presented, to evaluate the semantic localization of sentence
 embedding models.
 Semantically equivalent sentences are those which exhibit bidirectional
 entailment -- they each imply the truth of the other.
 Paraphrases are mostly semantically equivalent.
 Replacing a noun with its synonym creates another sentence which is semanticall
y equivalent to the original.
 Replacing a verb with its antonym creates a new sentence which is not.
 By comparing the distances of the generated sentences, and paraphrases
 from the original sentence, the relationship between semantic closeness
 and embedding distance can be seen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The models evaluated using this method show that they are substantially
 more permanent the a naive bag of words approach there is still significant
 room for improvement.
 While these models perform very well at related practical tasks, this new
 method highlights some of their limitations.
 It suggests that calling the vector space the models embed into a syntactic
 space is misleading.
 The space clearly incorporates elements of syntax and word choice, as well
 as meaning.
 This result is not surprising and indeed some papers (including 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "SocherEtAl2011:PoolRAE"

\end_inset

) do refer to the space this way.
 The new method does make its truth substantially clearer.

, dependency trees are used instead of the constituency tree used in the
 original URAE, because of its improved invariance to syntactical changes.
 This may, by decreasing the impact of syntax create models with a greater
 emphasis on semantic placement.
