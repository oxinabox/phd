This book covers popular deep neural networks for language processing.
They networks comprehensively reviewed and explained from a practical perspective.
Language modelling, vector representations, and challenging tasks such as WSD, and sentence embeddings are investigated to illustrate the use of these networks.
This book is packed with valuable advice obtained from first-hand experience in implementing these networks.
It is a solid introduction to one of the most exciting new areas of natural language processing and computational linguistics.
