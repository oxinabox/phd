	\section*{Notation}
	

	The following notation is used throughout this work.
	
	\aside[Words are treated as integers]{
		We consistently notate words, as if they were scalar integer values.
		writing for example $\n {w}_1$ as to be the first word in a sequence.
		Which is then used an an index:
		$\i C_{\n w_i}$ is it's corresponding word vector, from the embedding matrix $C$.

	}
	
	
	\aside[Superscripts and Subscripts]{
		Readers may wonder why we are using $\i x_i$, and $\n x_i$.
		Would not $\i x_i$ suffice?
		Why differentiate between elements of a sequence, and elements of a vector?
		
		The particularly problematic case,
		is that we often want to represent taking the $i$th element of a vector that is the $t$th element of a sequence of vectors.
		The vector, we would call $\nv x_t$,
		its $i$ element is $\i {\nv x_t}_i$.
		
		This is also not ambiguous with the matrix indexing notation $\i X_{i,t}$.			
		
		Rarely a superscript will be actually an exponent, e.g. $x^\frac{2}{3}$.
		This should be apparent when in this case.
		For more common is the natural exponent which we write $\exp{x}$.
