	\section*{Notation}
	

	The following notation is used throughout this work.
	
	\aside[Words are treated as integers]{
		For reasons that will become clear in \Cref{sec:word-representations}, we will consistently notate words, as if they were scalar integer values.
		writing for example $\n{w}1$ as to be the first word in a sequence.

	}
	
	
	\aside[Superscripts are never exponents]{
		Just to reiterate, we use $\n xt$ not to represent $\prod_{i=1}^{i=t} x$,
		but as a variable name.
		The only exponential that occurs in this work is the natural exponential, which we write $\exp x$.
		
		Readers may be more familiar with subscripts being used to allow more variable names e.g. $x_t$.
		However, we use this for indexing: that would be the $t$th element of $x$.
		
		In the case of recurrent neural networks, we often will want to reference both the $i$ element of the $t$th time-step variable: $\n xt$.
		This is thus unambiguously written written $\n {\i xi}t$.
