	\section*{Notation}
	

	The following notation is used throughout this work.
	
	\aside[Words are treated as integers]{
		We consistently notate words, as if they were scalar integer values.
		writing for example $\n {w}_1$ as to be the first word in a sequence.
		Which is then used an an index:
		$\i C_{\n w_i}$ is it's corresponding word vector, from the embedding matrix $C$.

	}
	
	
	\aside[Superscripts are never exponents]{
		Just to reiterate, we use $\n x_t$ not to represent $\prod_{i=1}^{i=t} x$,
		but as a variable name for a sequence element.
		The only exponential that occurs in this work is the natural exponential, which we write $\exp x$.
		
		Readers may be more familiar with subscripts being used to allow more variable names e.g. $x_t$.
		However, we use this for indexing: that would be the $t$th element of $x$.
		
		In the case of recurrent neural networks, we often will want to reference both the $i$ element of the $t$th time-step variable: $\n x_t$.
		This is thus unambiguously written written $\n {\i x_i}_t$.
