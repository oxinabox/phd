\chapter{Introduction}


For brevity we have had to limit discussion of sum aspections of natural language that one might like to represent.
In particular we have neglected all discussion on the notion that a word may be made up of multiple tokens.
For example \natlang{made up of}.
Phrases do receive some discussion in \Cref{sec:sentence-representations-and-beyond}.
However works such as \tcite{yin2014exploration} deserve more attention that we have space to give them.
