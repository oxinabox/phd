\chapter{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
\begin{abstract}
	Chapter 1: Introduction: 2-3 pages
	Introduce the book, and the utility of using machine learning for natural language processing
\end{abstract}


For brevity we have had to limit discussion of some aspect of natural language that one might like to represent.
In particular we have neglected all discussion on the notion that a word may be made up of multiple tokens.
For example \natlang{made up of}.
Phrases do receive some discussion in \Cref{sec:sentence-representations-and-beyond}.
However works such as \tcite{yin2014exploration} deserve more attention that we have space to give them.

\aside[Helpful hint]{If you find nonlinear reading unpleasant, then you may find the use of this sidebar unpleasant As such you may not enjoy this book.}

This book makes extensive use of marginalia, to provide side information.
This is used to provide reminders of definitions, and comments on potentially unfamiliar notations.
To highlight non-technical aspects of the works discussed.
To highlight very-technical aspects of the works discussed (such as implementation details).
They are also used to give the titles to citations (to save flicking to the huge list of references at the back of the book), and for the captions to the figures.
And more generally to provide non-essential  but potentially helpful information without interrupting the flow of the main text.
