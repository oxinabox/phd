\chapter{Machine Learning for Representations}\label{sec:machine-learning-for-representations}
%•	Chapter 2: Introduction to machine learning for representations (10 pages)
%o	This chapter can be skipped by readers already familiar with machine learning
%o	This will not be a full introduction to machine learning, which of-course could be an entire book on its own.
%o	It will cover the crucial basic techniques used in the works discussed in part B. The main focus will be on introducing neural networks, going into reasonable detail on hyper-parameters such as activation functions and layer sizes, as well as covering training techniques. 
%o	It will not cover techniques that are special to natural language processing – those will be discussed in chapters 4,5, and 6.
