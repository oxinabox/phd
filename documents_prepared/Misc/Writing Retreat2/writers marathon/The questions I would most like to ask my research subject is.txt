Are you continous?
And furthermore simply connected etc?
Indeed, what do you look like?
I would like to know if the vector spaces are sensible at all.
Indeed if they are truely vector spaces,
or just infinite sets of vectors.

Are they continous, or just revalued.
I am fairly sure the 5th5h5h5h5h5h5h5h5h5h5h
5h5h5h5h5
Sum of Word Embeddings, has an infitite number of holes where no such vector exists.
Like a fractal lacework,
compare to the overlaying vector space of real numbers.

But I'm not sure if these holes are all infinately small?
If they aren't then it could still be connected, 
indeed even if they are finitely in volume, they can still be be connected,
unless there are "moats" or "islands".

I am almost certain there are more holes than nonholes.
Indeed there must be
because any point in the sum of vectors space, 
is can ofcourse be expressd as a finite sum of vectors.
And that means that the sume of vector space contains only
at most a subset of all algebric vectors.
Because the base vectors them selves are eventually dervived,
from algebric expressions acting appoint intially generated pseudorandom numbers.
The space of pseudorandom numbers to begin with may not be truely algrebric,
but if it isn't then I think it must be some other similar set.
If nothing else because of finite time in generating them 
 --  though this is already an agruement over the nonconiunousness iof the vectors alone.
 
Even without resorting to computer representation arguements,
we can immedately conclude that we do not have the undescrible numbers in the SOWE space,
as they are not possible to describe in any languge even with infinate input.
Which no SOWE space has to begin with.

And since most real numbers are indescribable, therefor there are more holes, than filled places in the SOWE space.

But even if we ignore that, and think about the "Backdrop" for the lacework being some describale subset of the reals
