What have I done?
I fininished integrating the suggestions from Wei to the sum-resynthisis paper.
Most pf thiis was rewriting the lit review
Which I did.
The others were smaller changes.
I did about as much on that as I could, given I need to rewrite large sections once I redo ordering.

On the other side, (Things I shouldn't have been doing at the writers retreat)
I got hole of a a Gurobi liscense,
which allows me to do my World Touring Journey Mixed Integer Progamming method for solving the word order problem.
I Started to write that up. 
in particular writing up a Case study to give to Chris at NeCTAR.
THat was just today

What next?
I want to finish writing that case study,
and the ORdering with Mixed Integer Programming more generally.

In the longer term I want to finish this paper.
Which means finishing the experiments but that mean getting some good ordering results.
Which means I need to finished producing BOWs for the Books corpus.
Which has taken like a week. I'm not sure if it has chrashed or something.
I really sure have set it up to do like 10,000 at a time then write to disk.
I need to make a toolkit for doing exactly that.
I think I proposed this last writers retreat actually.
Some kind of generalised Coffee Break kinda deal, for experiment deployment.
Wrapping up logging, saving, resuming etc.
That would be good.
I feel like there is a python tool for this
But Mocha (/cafe) may not be a bad place to start.

Anyway
So What did I learn?
OTher fields don't have related work sections.
THat is pretty surprising to me.
I guess I must have learnt something about writing.
Apparently I *do* have to writing in paragraphs all the time.
Um, not sure what else.
I feel I must have learn more.
Mauybe I should jhve gotten a sense of direction from the Writers marathon?
hmmmmmmmmmm
