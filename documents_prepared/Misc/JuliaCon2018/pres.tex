		%\item 0: The results cannot be reproduced by an independent researcher.
		
		\item The results \alert{cannot seem to be reproduced}.
		
		\item The results could be reproduced by, \alert{requiring extreme effort.}
		
		\item The results can be reproduced, \alert{requiring considerable effort.}
		
		\item The results can be easily reproduced with \alert{at most \textbf{15 minutes} of user effort}, requiring some proprietary source packages (MATLAB, etc.).
		
		\item The results can be easily reproduced  with \alert{at most \textbf{15 min} of user effort}, requiring only standard, freely available tools (C compiler, etc.).		
	\end{enumerate}

	\note{What is the key determining factor here? User effort. How do we get down to 15 minutes of user effort?}

\begin{frame}{What happens when I try and reproduce someone's research code?}
	\begin{description}
		\item[1min] Find the website from the paper, and \alert{download the code}
		\item[2min] Read enough of the README to get rough bearings
		\item[\textbf{1min}] Find out where to get the data from and \alert{download the data}
		\item[\textbf{2min}] Try and remember how to use \inlinecode{tar -xzfvalphabetsoup} etc.
		\item[\textbf{2min}] Workout how to tell script \alert{where data is} \note{Hardcoded path? Argument?}
		\item[2min] Setup any software dependencies etc.
		\item[3min] Run the code and make sure it isn't crashing etc.
		\item[2min] Interpret the output

	\note{I have spent 5 of my 15 valuable minutes faffing around about sorting out the data.}
	\note{I think this timeline is fairly reasonable, of course an ideal julia project with everything already working in CI would do a lot better. But if you've got these steps, your already blocked from CI.}
