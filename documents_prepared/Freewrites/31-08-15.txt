Ok,
back to it.
It has been about a month tince I last did a freewrite.
Cos I haven't been writing much and have been doing experiments.
but now back to writing.

My proposal is due on, roughly the 17th.
This conference paper is due on roghly the 29th.
That is 2.5 and 4 weeks away respectively.

Today I will work on my proposal since
I would like ot here back form my supervisiors on the last set of results I posted.


I could use the subset of the amazon corpus to train some new models.
That is likely worth doing.
So I may kick that off at lunch time,
afet I have made a start on the proposal.
That will require disconnecting my volume storage from Danu,
and connecting it to a new vm.
Call it Tlaloc.

I don't think I need a new snapshot from Danu right now.
Though when the amazon shuffle completes (current estimate 5 more days),
I will prob snapshot it for good measure.
Alternitively, since I will have been working on Tlaloc,
it might be best to snapshot that.

I think I will request Tlaloc be created now,
so it has time to allocated while I am working on my proposal.

So that is me back at the freewriting.
