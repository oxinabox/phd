So i need to write some htingds at hthe start of every day, 
to over come writetrs block nad yto bulid moementum.
so i am wring some things

I want to get the draft oif the hansard paper looking in draft shgape.
I want all the secontaoions to say somehting
It does;t have to say the right things 9 bgut I would like them to say somehting.
I am not going to worry about pretty diagrams.
I might pus in some place holdes though
.
What am I going ot do to minimise the time i take to recreate diagrams?

If i was in R I could using knitr.
I wonder if there is knit for python yet?
I think I looked into this before, and there was not.

So back ot talking about what I am going to do.

My work is intesteding cos LDA does not succeed at this task.

I wonder if I shouldn't be targeting the document comfgerence in sydney instead?
This would be on topic there.
As would my other work.

I can get it written then make the decision after.
I wonder how the review for the PSO paper is going?

I still have 2 minugtes more writing to do.
I think this freewrit9ing gets easier with practice.
 I need to look up what time the writing workshopes are.
 I believe if i just turned my head I could find out.
 But I can't cos I ma doing ythis writing.
 
 So freewringing, huh?
 I wonder what Izzy is doing?
 I need ot keep wringing for 30 more seconds
 Izzy is nice. I like her.
 So bluah balha balha blah balah.
