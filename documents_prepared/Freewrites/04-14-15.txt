Ok, here we go again.
I start all of these freewrites like that.

I am feeling very agitated today.
I am basically all ready for the conference,
a bit more practice would help.

I kinda want to go homne a play some video games.

What I need to do though is get into the writing of the SOWE resythisis paper.

I really want to cut it down, but No Editting Til It is Done.
So I won't.
I might write the sections I want to work on -- results -- in its own separate document.
So I am not distracted by the rest of the paper.

I I think i want ot use PGF plots,
but actually I don't really have any plots to show.
I might use it for the tables.
but what is the point.

I am feeling very agitated.
Less now maybe.

I need to go eat lunch, maybe I'll have more focus on this after lunch.

So as I recall what needs to go into the paper is the results,
also into related works the new paper I found.

Somewhere -- in the introduction -- it should be highlighted that my new work is intersting as it is determantistic, and uses existing embeddings.
Somewhere it should be mentioned, that preliminary results suggest similar performance with out embedding methods.

I kinda want to write it up as a poster right now, since I found poster making fun.
That might help me clarify my thoughts.

I might try writing up an abstract.
That might be good.
