It has been a while since i Have doens a free write.
Maybe over a year.
But today I am having much difficulty getting started
I need to do the report for pitch perfect and submit my time sheets.
that is the big goal.
For some reason I am dreading that.
Oh wow it is really raining,
I thought it was going to clear up today.
we are miving house tomorrow
Hopefully it is not reaining too much then .

maybe it is not raining so much as blowing a lot of tind.
or it ocud be both.

anyway, once I have finished the pitch perfect report I will do some of my book.
I like writing my book.
it is nice,
I can be very expressive.anyw
I can take my time and ramble a bit
and writing sidenotes is super fun.
SOm eo of the advance latex is giving me grief but I like the challange of it.
Eg Lualatex is apparently borked.

which is just relaly annoying 
But anyway first I have to do this writup.
but anyway need to go through emails for it.
It is probably not actually too hard.
But idk if the information is there.
I'm not sure where it has been put.
