Almost 2 weeks of freewring done.
I find my enthusiams is still abit down.
It'll come back though.

Perhaps more caffine/sugar.

I got to keep on trucking with the paper write up.

I feel like I can have the method all done by today.
I think that is a reasonable goal.

Maybe squeeze in some more background/motivation.
See how going.

No editting, apparently editting is bad.
so things thins and suff and things.

I grabbed cambridge gammar (2002) which seems good.
Or at least it is commonly reference online.
It is a giant tome of a book.

I figuire this freewringing stuff is all about getting used to the sound of your own voice,
on keyboard.

I am in the UCC.
It is quiet, in that there are not too many people around,
but it is quiet noisy, as there is come cleaning and/or construction being done.
Maybe after this freewrite i will sit down and read the Grammar.
So one more minute left.
BEfore reading I will check that my vectors are being made,
and also set up a new doc2vec model using concatenations.
Also will check that JabRef installed right.
Or... at all.
