so here we are, day many of freewriting.
I almost didn't do it today.
I have been  some thing somehtinbg ah tired.

Cos Jon Game run unti;l like 2:30 am last night/.
but now act 2 is done.
In its place Leonard and I are going to do 
fortnightly microscope.
Or so we hope.

Leonard's party is not this weekend but next.
I appear to be going fairly oftopic right now.
Could be cos am I tired.
I have also been clumsy.
and my wrists are crapping.
perhaps I would like an ergonomic keyboard.
I do tend to angle my wrists inwards/outwards like a Vee.
So
anyway

I really do need ot write up the papers on what I have got so 
that I can see what i need.
But yesterday I came up with a different (possibly different)
method for word sense disambiguation.
I feel the need to test it and see how it does.
I think it work s pretty good, but on my just playing around testing.
I am going ot use somehting proper.
the english section of SemEval 2013 's multilinqual WSD task.

If it gets anytjhinbg near 70% then that would be topnotch.
THat would make it compeditive with the algorithms combining
machine learning.

So I still have about a minute left.
There are other things.

Izzy lost her job yesterday, but I am not concerned.

I am here on a Friday,
that means I may be present for a meeting in the lab.
that is unusual.

So now i am about done with the freewrite
and will go back to testing this WSD.
