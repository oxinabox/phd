Ok
So I made it to uni by 9.
Stopped to get coffee at 9:03.
Got to lab at 9:15
Here I am starting the freewrite at 9:35.

So I guess that is a mostly success.

Today I need to put in the results.

I also need to put in the size of the corpus.

So that is what I will do.
There is perhaps some scope for hypothisis testing - p-values etc.
perhaps not.

Things and stuff.
So here I am.
One more day.
One day nearer to dieing.
I need to turn Autocorrect back on.

If I can get the draft done quickly I can go home
have a afternoon off.
So I should work hard.

Also it will be more convient for everyone one,
if they have more time to read it.

I need to find the GRS coversheet for drafts.

Anyway, 2 more minutes.

I think 


Getting the Bag of Word baseline in I think helps alot.
While most models do poorly,
they don't do as badly as bag of words.

I think in the presentation,
I will need to convert the numbers so bigger is better.

So noun-sym <= paraphrase
verb-anto > paraphrase.
Then I can talk about portion of passes.

So that is what I will do.
