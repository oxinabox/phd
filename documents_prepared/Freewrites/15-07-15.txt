Ok
Day 5 of doing this freewriting
it is 9:05 am and I am and the GRS thing where you do writ5ing.
Writing workshop.
bal balab,lab,abalbaabalb
So today I have 2 hours here then my meeting with my supervisor.
So I need to do some writing.
And normally I would prepare some paper to show my supervisor,
or some graphs of results or something
but normally I would be doing that now,
so I guess it won't be done today.
I don't think I will have a draft out of this in 2 hours.
Though I might 
I have the two papers to work on.

The hansard one, which I don't have any particularly pressing ideas to add to 
-- though I do need to describe the models more, and fill in a lot of results.

And the SemSyn Eval which I have lots of ideas that need to be added.
For SemSyn Eval I am starting to think I need to add
THE word sense disambiguation.
But Lesk based algorithms are crap.
<40% acurassy. 
I am going to talk to dr togneri about that today.
Word sense disambigiontion is needed to ensure that 
gramatical sentences are not synoyms for prison sentnences.
There are some other algorithms I could be using,
but they are less mature.

SO only one minute togo. 
This is passing quicker every time
I need to either remove my need for defintions or add definitions to my paper.
I will ask at this workshop about them
It may be worth having them just temporary like,  to hold my thoughts 
and then to edit them away later.

I Really do need a good defintion of syntax and semantics, or maybe i should just use the words structure and meaning
