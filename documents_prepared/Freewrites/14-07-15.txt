Ok
So day 3 of this freewrigning business.
I have lost my bike light.
I will have ot rplace it I guess.

So today I wish to get the guts of the "How we made the corpus" section of the 
Evalatenting SemvsSynt eval

This is going to involve a lot of definitions, which I hope to get from
Chroistoper mannings book.

It will also involve plenty of referencing.
To the various tools I used.

I expect ot produce a lot of lists and tables.

I will have a table mapping from  POS Tags to Wordnes  Noun, verb etc
A table mapping from POS tags to Unstemming methods.

A list of all Auxiliary verbs, whichb i banned, with a citation ( hopefholy chris manning again) for what they are.
I am thirsty after this freewrite i need ot refill my water bottle.
My hands are not too cold.

so blha balhab blah balhab

Other tables I want
I need some examples of systences that are varies using the method.
 Likely bolding the changed word each time.
 
I need to have some other things;.
I think today is a good day to get the definition of syntax vs semantics down pat.

IK need a table of sounces of ground truth. w9ihc ould also list the tools.

I need to mae a good argument as to why noun s7ysnonyms are unliklely to changing meaning but verb antonyms are.

So ground truth source:

SCOWL for existence of words
WordNet for existence of phrases. (Cite Milkov and the lost paper for about phrases being different).
