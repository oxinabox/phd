Ok here we go.

Writing. breaking the Ice.
Yeah that stuff.

So today is the big get a alot of stuff done on the confernce paper day.

I want to have all my results in palce.
Particularly the error co-occurances need adding.
I want to have the tab;les of occurances from the corpora replaced with histograms.

I want to add a limitations section whereI talk about hte lack of care taken to avoid common word choice within each class.

Begin:
Unlike, in the work of /CITE no care was taken to avoid classes having common words with in them. Indeed it is very common, particularly in the Opinosis subcorpus for this to be the case. This does make the problem easier for models which can reason with word overlap, eg BOW. These occurrences do correspond to the real-world phenomenon -- when people say things with the same meaning, they tend to use the same words. Due to the importance of this principle, it suggests that all models lacking the capacity to utilise the word meaning directly would benefit from supplementation with another model.
