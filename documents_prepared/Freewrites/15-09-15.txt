At the end of the day there is another day dawning!
and the sun in the morning is waiting to rise!

It is 6:33 in the morning and I have been in the lab for 3 minutes.
5:30 wake up.
Prob about the same as my father, who is going ot do a full days work before driving up to perth for my graduation.
I am more excited about seeing my parents than my graduation.
I mean graduating is nice and all.

So Dr Togeneri said he wanted to "final draft" of my project proposal by this morning.
It maybe by 11:59am this morning.
Hopefully it will not.

I would rather give him something edited.
There are only two remaining sections, but they are th ereal meat of it.
The Project Plan, and the Lit Review.
I know the content for both,
and I have the most time-consuming parts of both done -- the diagrams.
But I don't really know how to express my lit review.
I should take another look at my examples.

they kicked Tony Abbott out of the PM's chair.
That makes my slideshow wrong.
Which is awkward.
