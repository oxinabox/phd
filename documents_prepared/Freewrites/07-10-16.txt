Right, here we go again.
I am pretty tired.
I stayed up too late working out how to rended Julia code as LaTeX
It was really cool
But when I am tired I have trouble staying motivated.

So I still want to work on this paper.
I hopefully want to start sticking results in today.

There is a notion that I could do a smarker way to work out which sense a compound word / collocation comes from
By checking for the change of the words occring in each otehr's contexts.
I think that could be worth it, to deal with the fact that I should be checking all POS tags maybe.
No that is wrong as my words to not themselves *have* pos-tags.
It may still be faster, than checking the contexts of each word to find the wighted sum over the union of all word senses of each word that makes up the collocation.
Since that is $$n_context * n_senses * n_words$$
vs checking co-occurance change is $$n_senses * n_words!/(nwords-2)! = n_senses * (nwords^2-nwords)$$

Which for $$n_context=10$$, $$n_sense=30$$, $$n_words=2$$
$$n_context * n_senses * n_words = 10*30*2=600$$
$$n_senses * (nwords^2-nwords)* = 30 * 2^2 - 2 = 30*2 = 60$$ 


$$n_context * n_senses * n_words < n_senses * (nwords^2-nwords)$$ iff $$n_context + 1 < n_nwords$$

I.e in pactice, Never.
since $$n_context<=10$ normally $$n_context=10$
and normally $$n_nwords < 5$$
