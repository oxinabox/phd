Ok,
here we go.
It is 11  oclock.
So til 11:05.
SO a freewrite.
I am at the writing retreat.
It goes for one week
I am really worried about not responding to / sending swancon emails.
But I can do this.

I am going to do writing.
Maybe,
no definately,
if I complete my writing task for today,
of redoing the lit review,
I can check up on my experiments.
I do need to check on them.
Suring the books corpus is done proccessing by now.
Its had like 4 days.

So anyway,
the lit review I am going to work on today.
I have some feedback from Wei.
I have some past notes I deleted.
I need to order it chronologically,
to an extent
particularly the generation section.

If I was doing a what do that call them?
Show your work session, today.
I think I could show just the lit review.

I am kind of thinking about writing a poster.

I would like to use creating a poster, as a exercise to help clarify my work.
So I might do that tomorrow.
Prior to doing the "Superfiical" editting.
Where I need to make my introduction and conclusion strong, and clear.
Can I make a poster in one day?
I can probably make a poster in 2 days.
That is what it took before.
But the poster then did have the presentation and the paper to draw on.
So I probably can't do it in one day, so that is probably ruling it out as a focusing exercise,
but not nessisarily.
I should book in to ask about it.
Maybe.
Ok freewrite over.
I am going to go outside.
Then to work.
