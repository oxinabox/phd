Right.
One day nearto dying.
At the end of rthe day you are another day older.
And thatg is all you can say for the life of the poor
It is a struggle it is a war,
and there is nothing that anyone's giving.
One more day.
Standing about
what is it for?!


So Today has been a reeeeeealy slow start
it is 11:30 now.
I need to get my sleep back in order.
it is hard with Izzy.
Cos I want to hang with her.
But she needs more sleep than me.
A lot more.

Anyway.
Goal is to wrap things up with this paper by 3.
For the first draft.

What is left to do is some more analysis in results.
Though I might  just leave that abalnk and get suggestions 
from supervisors.
Finish of the methodolgy.
And then editting.

I would like to draw soem kind of red line diagram
To chart out the narative.

I have been getting distracted reading about minecreaft
and panellign swancon.

I think the paper is shaping up.

After the paper is done at 3.
I will work on my presentation
and my proposal lit review.

So at least I am getting writing done fast.
After this I will go and wake Izzy,
Maybe not.

I will attept (in maybe 30 minutes)
to bribe her to get up with pepsi.
and if she doesn't want it.
I will take it for myself.

I would like to finish this paper.
Have it done.
Also my proposal.
And propsal presentation.
I think next week is research week.
Unless this week is.
I may want to check the schedcual for that.
