Ok, here we go, day 2 of round 2? n?
Some integer.

So A quick freewrite (hahah theyt are all 5 minutes)
before I head off to the GRS writing thing. Not sure what to call that.

So I guess today I want to make my article article shaped.
I didn't manage to get up to incoperating results or reshaping it yesterday.

I am going to base the shape of Binu and Baroni's paper in the area i think. Or perhaps Iyyer et al.

I am wondering about TACL -- Transactions of the Association for Computer Linguistics, as a journal.
They have a 6 page limit, and review fast like a conference, but they do allow resubmit with modifications (like a Journal).
Also publications with them an elegable to be presented at a conference of theirs; and they host fairly high end conferences. Good conferences at least.

Beyond the reshaping, 
I gues I want ot put in the results still.
And the experimental methodology.
E.g. how I preproccessed the corpus.

So one more minute.
So do I need to do anything else to day?
I'll have my meeting tomorrow.
I guess I shluld check my emails before I go.
