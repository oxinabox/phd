Wow, it has been a long time since i have written one of these.
So it was 5 minutes, right?

Well how about I explain what i am going to do today?
SO I need to keep writing things in particular I need to write this paper.
But I keep finding things I want to invextigate and add.

So maybe that is jst a form of procrastination.
I should get the paper written.
then after it is written I can invistigate more,
and add things then.
That way my supervistors can review it while I continue invextigations.

I do only have about 19 days to get it done.
Which sounds like a lot, but it really isn't
Not when it takes me several days per page.
But I guess that is mostly procrastination.
So I should really try and stick my head down,
and just write until it is done.

OS I still have 3 more minutes.

So the particular section I want to write today is the Lit Review, I guess.
No, scratch that, I want to finish the explination of method.
Then the lit review.

I have big chunks of both written, so it should mostly just be transfering across.

Still 2 minutes.
I do find the least squares regression really interesting.
I am trying to think if it could be just learning the sense frequencies.
It gets given all the correct lexicals senses paired with the likelyhood output of the general WSD on the induced senses.
That means it has a lot more data for the lexical senses that occur often.
Does that let it fit?
