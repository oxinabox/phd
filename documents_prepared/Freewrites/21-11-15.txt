So here we go again, back on it.
You can tell I am trying to write again as I am freewriting again.
So it is 9:05 am.
I got in at 7:30 am.
But then I had to del with swanconstuff which apprarently took 1.5 hours.
2017 wants to run a general public survey.
It actually could be pretty good but idk.
I'm not sure.
I don't think it will be statistically sound.
Anyway, so get my head back into the game, as it were.
Today I am going to get some solid writing done.
I am going to summerise my algorithm,
and get the results inplace.
That will make the paper be papershaped.
Proper structure.
I might need to add some headings after I get the algorithm discription in.
When I get bord/stuck,
I will make a tikz program/graphic to draw a 2D path search.
I might actually still have one from my project proposal.
I would like to have this paper in fairly solid shape prior to going to ADCS, then I can use it to show people.
I need to tell stephen  that I am not hard against the plan of 2017.
But  I don't like it.
