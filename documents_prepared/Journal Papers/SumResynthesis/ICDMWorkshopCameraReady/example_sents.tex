		\caption{\label{egiyyer} A comparison our method, to the example sentences generated by the DT-RAE method of \textcite{iyyer2014generating}. \oracletitle{}  shows the word ordering step on the reference BOW. the Sel. and Ord. columns indicate if the output had the correct words selected, and ordered respectively. With \cmark{} indicating correct and \xmark{} indicating incorrect. \namark{} indicates not only that ordering was not correct, but that the MIP problem had no feasible solutions at all.
		\iref{} shows the result of the method of \textcite{iyyer2014generating}, when the dependency tree of the output is provided to the generating process, whereas in \ip{} an arbitrary dependency tree is provided to the generating process. Note that the reference used as input to \twosteptitle{} and \oracletitle{} sentence was varied slightly from that used in \textcite{iyyer2014generating} and \textcite{White2015BOWgen}, in that terminating punctuation was not removed, and nor were multiword entity references grouped into single tokens.}
