Note that in three of the cases the MIP ordering problem has no feasible solutions, in this case the word order shown is random for \oracletitle, and the output of the word-selection step for \twosteptitle. Where ordering did succeed the probability of that sentence (out of all sentences) is show.  In \iref is shown the result of the method of \textcite{iyyer2014generating}, when the dependency tree of the output is provided to the generating process. Where-as in \ip an arbitrary dependency tree of the is provided to the generating process.Note that the reference used as input to \twosteptitle and \oracletitle sentence was varied slightly from that used in \textcite{iyyer2014generating} and from \textcite{White2015BOWgen}, in that punctuation was not removed, and multiword entity references were not grouped into single tokens.}
