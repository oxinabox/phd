	\chapter{Overview: Tooling}
	For the carrying out of this research a number of software packages were created for the Julia programming language.
	These contribute substantially to the Julia ecosystem for natural language processing, machine learning and more generally data science.
	
%	This section summarised a number of tools created and significantly contributed towards.
	
%	TODO: Submit the following to JOSS	\url{https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/review_criteria.html}.
%	
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item TensorFlow.jl
%		\item WordTokenizers.jl
%		\item MultiResolutionIterators.jl
%		\item WordEmbeddings.jl
%		\item CorpusLoaders.jl
%	\end{itemize}
