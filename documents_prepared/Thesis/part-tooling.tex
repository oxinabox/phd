	For the carrying out of this research a number of software packages were created for the julia programming language.
	These contribute substantially to the julia ecosystem for natural language processing, machine learning and more generally data science.
	This section summarised a number of tools created and significantly contributed towards.

	\begin{preamble}
		This paper is currently under review for the Journal of Open Research Software.
		The tool was also presented at the 5th Julia Language Conference, JuliaCon2018
		as part of the talk ``DataDeps.jl and other foundational tools for data driven research''.
