Hi Lyndon,

finished reading your paper, it is nicely written and easy to understand -- even after having beers :)

Comments:
    * the description of features in 2.2.1 is the only part which is a bit unclear .. how you get those numbers of 100/200/600 features.
      Maybe you could state how many features of which type (POS, character position, number of occ, ...) there are. But it's not so important for the paper ..

    * Why did you evaluate the model trained only against a single other book series, ie. why do you not also evaluate WOT vs (trained on) ASOIF+SOC, for example?
      That might give slightly better results.

    * Finally, it might be interesting to know which share of errors was caused by (the absence of a character-detecting) NER tagger, ie. how often a non-character was selected of POV-character.
      ie, if somebody will in the future provide a NER Tagger that reliably detects persons (characters) in this domain, would this improve your accuracy?

Other:
    * typo before "This works well" .. missing dot.

Positional 2 first last
Occurance  2 count, rank
rem = 96
ergo POS = 48
