{
	A sentence is a group of words expressing a complete thought.
}

\begin{abstract}
	This chapter discusses representations for larger structures in natural language.
	The primary focus is on the sentence level.
	However, many of the techniques also apply to sub-sentence structures (phrases), and super-sentence structures (documents).
	The three main types of representations discussed here are: unordered models, such as sum of word embeddings; sequential models, such as recurrent neural networks; and structured models, such as recursive autoencoders.
