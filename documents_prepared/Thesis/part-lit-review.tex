\part{Literature Review}
\chapter{Overview of the field}
I present here, the traditional literature review chapter in a nontrational form: as 3 chapters taken from a book I wrote during my candidature.
The book ``Neural Representations of Natural Language'' is currently available from SpringerBriefs.
I include here the three core, non-introductory chapters, in there original manuscript form.
This skips over the original preface, and the chapters introducing machine learning and recurrent neural networks.

\chapter{Discussion of the state of the field}
In these three literature review chapters I have introduced the core notions used in modern machine learning based natural language processing.
Each of the papers in the following sections also include there own background and related works sections detailing specifically relevant works to their area.
