%\chapter{Overview: Contrasting Classical and Neural Representations}
%In the works in this section I contrast classical representation approaches with more modern neural network-based representational approaches.
%
%\Cref{SentVecMeaning} presents an abstract comparison of multiple neural network sentence representations compared to the classical bag of words.
%The core idea of the comparison in \Cref{SentVecMeaning} is to see how easy it is to partition the vector representation space according to the partitioning of natural language space of meaning.
%The natural language space is partitioned by meaning: an equivalent relation of paraphrases is defined, which gives rise to that partitioning.
%The task assesses that by assessing if subsets of the data when represented using a system can be used to train a linear SVM to determine the class (partition) of the held-out phrases.
%Using the conclusion that a good vector representation of sentences results sentences from different paraphrase groups being:
%linearly separable
%
%
%
%The systems evaluated included PV-DM and PV-DBOW.
%The work was done before these systems were discredited, 
%as discussed in \Cref{LR:SenseRep}.
%The results presented in this work supported the findings of the limited value of those systems.
